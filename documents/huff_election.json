{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The states that have now joined the suit are New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia and Michigan.\n\nAfter failing to obtain congressional support for a spending bill that included $5.7 billion in funding to begin building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, then signing a bill that included $1.375 billion for border security, the president declared a national emergency last week so he could go around the legislative branch to secure billions more that he says is needed to start work on the barrier.\n\n\u201cContrary to the will of Congress, the President has used the pretext of a manufactured \u2018crisis\u2019 of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,\u201d the lawsuit states. The suit also alleges Trump has veered the country toward \u201ca constitutional crisis of his own making,\u201d adding that a national emergency declaration is not necessary, by the president\u2019s own admission.\n\nWhen making the declaration last week, Trump admitted he \u201cdidn\u2019t need to\u201d declare a national emergency to build the border wall, but he wanted to \u201cdo it much faster.\u201d Critics quickly noted the president\u2019s own words could be used against him in court.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra led the coalition of states to file the suit, tweeting on Monday that they are challenging Trump\u2019s \u201d#FakeNationalEmergency,\u201d which he described as a \u201cbrazen overreach to rob taxpayers & an insult to the Democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution.\u201d\n\nMore details: on #PresidentsDay, @CAgovernor & I filed a lawsuit w/15 states to challenge President Trump\u2019s #FakeNationalEmergency, a brazen overreach to rob taxpayers & an insult to the Democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution. #NoWall https://t.co/eB9pUZaZQs \u2014 Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) February 19, 2019\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Becerra added, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the president is trying to usurp Congress\u2019s authority. The president does not have the power of the purse.\u201d\n\nThe federal lawsuit is the latest in what\u2019s expected to be a series of legal challenges of the president\u2019s emergency declaration. On Friday, the same day Trump declared a national emergency, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a suit claiming the Department of Justice failed to produce the requisite documents justifying the president\u2019s declaration. The American Civil Liberties Union also plans to sue the administration, arguing that Trump cannot legally use the emergency declaration to circumvent Congress for funding a border wall.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-stone-judge-instagram_n_5c6b1233e4b0b9cc78ff507e": "Roger Stone \u2015 the Republican strategist and Donald Trump associate indicted on charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2015 went after the federal judge presiding over his case on Instagram, publishing her picture next to what appeared to be an image of crosshairs and begging for money from his followers.\n\nIn a message that was posted, lambasted, deleted, edited, reposted and re-deleted over the course of a few hours on Monday, Stone claimed that \u201cDeep State hitman Robert Mueller\u201d assigned him Judge Amy Berman Jackson \u201cthrough legal trickery.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s attorneys later in the day filed a \u201cNotice of Apology\u201d from Stone to the judge. \u201cPlease inform the Court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted,\u201d Stone wrote in a signed letter in the document. \u201cI had no intention of disrespecting the Court and humbly apologize to the Court for the transgression.\u201d\n\nThe photo of Jackson, which appears to have originated from an anti-Semitic conspiracy blog, featured the words \u201cCorruption Central\u201d and an image of what appear to be crosshairs next to her head.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-kentucky-school-border_n_5c69ef82e4b01757c36ca404": "Sen.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) rushed to the president\u2019s defense Sunday when asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d whether Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration violated the principles of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, of which he is a member.\n\n\u201cThis is an emergency, this is a crisis.

Trump rescinded those protections upon taking office but their status remains in limbo due to pending court cases.\n\n\u201cCongress has the power to address this move by the president, and we must use it. As President Obama said himself in 2013, he is not an emperor; his job is to execute laws that are passed, not write his own. Congress must hold him accountable,\u201d Jordan said in a statement in 2014.\n\nThe comparison between Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and his predecessor\u2019s executive action on immigration is not perfect; Trump is claiming authority via the National Emergencies Act of 1976, a legally dubious move in itself. But the case does illustrate the willingness of some Republicans to cheer on a president as he attempts to circumvent Congress \u2015 as long as it\u2019s for a priority they support.\n\nDuring a separate interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen.

But the Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman, who once called Obama\u2019s actions on immigration \u201cunconstitutional overreach,\u201d did not voice a similar objection to Trump\u2019s attempt to unilaterally secure funds for his border wall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly the expansion of authority Congress has given past presidents, this president has the same authority. I wish he wouldn\u2019t use it in this case. But again, I understand his frustration,\u201d Johnson said Sunday.\n\nWhile six previous presidents collectively declared dozens of national emergencies, Trump\u2019s declaration over a border wall would be the first to finance a project that Congress explicitly refused to pay for.\n\nTrump on Friday signed a spending bill into law that allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 a fraction of the president\u2019s $5.7 billion demand for more than 200 miles of concrete or steel barriers. He said he would obtain an additional $8 billion in part by redirecting billions that Congress approved for Department of Defense military construction projects.\n\nDemocrats hammered the announcement as \u201cunlawful\u201d and vowed to quickly challenge it in the courts.

So here\u2019s your guide to what\u2019s happening with the Mueller probe and what comes next.\n\nAll right, so this is all about Russian interference in the 2016 election. What have we learned about that?\n\nA decent amount so far, but we don\u2019t yet have the full picture. Much of the media coverage of the Mueller investigation has focused on the Americans in Trump\u2019s orbit who have been caught up in the probe. But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media.\n\nOne reason those cases don\u2019t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there\u2019s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they\u2019re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments \u2014 one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 \u2014 are essential parts of the Mueller probe.\n\nThe first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system\u201d and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals \u2015 most of them military intelligence officers \u2015 \u201cconducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public.\n\nOK, other than all those Russians, who in Trump\u2019s circle has Mueller indicted?\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone.\n\nThere were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don\u2019t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn\u2019t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon.\n\nWho has the Mueller investigation found committed crimes?\n\nThe special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates.\n\nManafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial.\n\nIs anyone going to prison?\n\nPapadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat about Paul Manafort?\n\nManafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time.\n\nAfter he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller\u2019s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews \u2015 committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI.\n\nHow long has this Mueller probe been going on?\n\nMueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them \u2015 named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhen is the Mueller report coming out?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it\u2019s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It\u2019s unclear what form that would take.\n\nWhat kind of operation is Mueller running?\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty tight ship. There haven\u2019t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves).\n\nHow has Trump\u2019s legal team responded?\n\nBy getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI \u2015 generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization \u2015 was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau\u2019s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton\u2019s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election.\n\nAfter the Mueller probe wraps up, is that it?\n\nNo. There have been some clear signs that Mueller\u2019s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren\u2019t on Mueller\u2019s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it\u2019s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney\u2019s office without setting off a bunch of alarms.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump\u2019s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August.\n\nSo that\u2019s how Jeff Bezos\u2019 dick pics fit into all this?\n\nRight. The Enquirer published Bezos\u2019 intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos \u2014 the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn\u2019t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There\u2019s a question whether what he calls \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d violates AMI\u2019s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let\u2019s say, a complexifier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in everything?\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2015 based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public.\n\nRosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He\u2019s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed.\n\nWho is Matt Whitaker, and how the heck did he become Rosenstein\u2019s boss?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn\u2019t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush\u2019s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe.\n\nWhere does WikiLeaks fit in?\n\nA key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails\u2019 release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election.\n\nSome of the special counsel\u2019s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone.\n\nSo what is Roger Stone charged with, exactly?\n\nMueller\u2019s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel\u2019s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering.\n\nThe indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury \u2014 referring to a scene in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to \u2014 and threatened Credico\u2019s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIs there anyone else implicated in the Roger Stone indictment?\n\nThere\u2019s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted.\n\nDraft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year.\n\n\n\nGuess we should talk more about Michael Cohen\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress.\n\nHis indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization\u2019s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted.\n\nCohen told investigators that at Trump\u2019s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nWhat ended up happening with the Moscow Trump Tower?\n\nIt never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen\u2019s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with that secret Supreme Court battle?\n\nThis one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business \u2015 called \u201cCorporation\u201d from \u201cCountry A\u201d in court filings \u2015 trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the \u201cCorporation\u201d has to comply with the subpoena, but didn\u2019t explain its decision.\n\nAll this mystery could amount to nothing \u2015 it\u2019s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation.\n\nDoes it matter that the Democrats now control the House?\n\nIt does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe. This would also potentially help bring the Mueller investigation findings into the public eye if the White House or new attorney general attempts to suppress the report.\n\nIs Don Jr. going to prison?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. isn\u2019t currently facing any charges, so at least in the short term, the answer is no. But ever since the special counsel indicted Cohen for lying to Congress, there has been an increased focus on whether Trump Jr. could face similar charges.\n\nTrump Jr. told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that he never directly or indirectly sought foreign assistance for his dad\u2019s campaign. However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion. He held a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin. Days before the meeting, an intermediary emailed Trump Jr. to let him know that a senior Russian government official was offering to provide damaging information on Clinton.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-poll-republicans-russian-interference_n_5c631e27e4b0b50014aa989d": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Nearly two years into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds that only a minority of Republican voters believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAnd even though a number of former Trump campaign officials have already pleaded guilty to crimes, a large chunk of Trump voters believes Mueller will eventually conclude that no one on Trump\u2019s team broke any laws.\n\nJust 27 percent of Republicans believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the poll found, with 54 percent saying Russia didn\u2019t play a role and the remainder unsure. By contrast, 80 percent of Democrats and half of the public overall say they believe Russia interfered in the election.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation has led to the indictments of 13 Russians accused of posing as Americans and using social media to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, as well as 12 Russian intelligence officers charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen documents.\n\nWhile members of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2015 George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and Michael Cohen \u2015 have already admitted criminal wrongdoing, 43 percent of Republicans think Mueller\u2019s investigation will conclude that nobody on the Trump campaign committed any crimes. An additional 38 percent expect the investigation to find that members of the Trump campaign, but not the president, commited crimes. Just 6 percent of Republicans expect Mueller to implicate the president.\n\nDemocrats have extremely high expectations the Mueller probe will reach the White House, with 60 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Clinton voters saying they believe Mueller will conclude that Trump himself committed crimes. (Federal prosecutors have already said that Trump \u2015 who they referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d \u2015 directed Cohen to make illegal payments to cover up alleged affairs that could have hurt his campaign.)\n\nOpinions on the Mueller investigation have changed relatively little over the past year, according to the survey, despite a number of new indictments and other developments. Americans are split 38 percent to 37 percent on whether they approve or disapprove of the FBI\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation; in February 2018, they were split 35 percent to 37 percent.\n\nAs in past polling, opinions remain largely ossified along partisan lines, and often even more sharply along electoral ones. Just 34 percent of Trump voters have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with nearly three-quarters believing the bureau is biased against the president. By contrast, 84 percent of Clinton voters express at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with about two-thirds expecting the agency to deal fairly with Trump. Both sets of numbers are little changed from the previous survey.\n\nThe remainder of the public, whose political views might be more malleable, are largely tuned out of the story. Just 26 percent of non-voters say they\u2019ve been following about Mueller\u2019s investigation even somewhat closely, and only 27 percent report having at least a fairly good understanding of what the investigation has uncovered. More than half say they\u2019re not sure whether they approve of Mueller\u2019s handling of his job as special counsel.\n\nAbout the same percentage of Trump and Clinton voters said they were following news about the Russia probe \u201cvery closely,\u201d but a larger number of Trump voters (36 percent) than Clinton voters (30 percent) claimed they understood what Mueller had uncovered \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\nThe survey indicated that 73 percent of Clinton voters thought the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia was a \u201cvery serious problem,\u201d while 63 percent of Trump voters thought it was \u201cnot a problem at all.\u201d Nine out of 10 Clinton voters believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election, while 50 percent of Trump voters say Russia did not interfere in the election.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions, and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The complaint has been sent but not yet officially received by the FEC.\n\n\u201cMr. Schultz cannot continue to skirt the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements by publicly stating that he has not made a final decision regarding his candidacy if such a decision has already been made,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nBy law, any individual \u201ctesting the waters\u201d is allowed to spend money \u201cconducting polling, traveling around a district or state, and placing telephone calls to see if there is sufficient support for a candidacy.\u201d But there are also certain activities that indicate an individual has moved beyond that phase, which American Bridge believes Schultz might have already done.\n\n\u201cThe FEC should immediately investigate whether Howard Schultz has engaged in activities that went beyond merely \u2018testing the waters\u2019 for a presidential campaign and instead made expenditures to further his own candidacy for president,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nSuch activities include \u201craising more money than what is reasonably needed,\u201d \u201cusing general public political advertising to publicize their intention to campaign\u201d and \u201cconducting activities over a protracted period of time or shortly before the election.\u201d Candidates need to register with the FEC in those cases if they \u201cif they have raised or spent more than $5,000.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement, a Schultz spokesperson dismissed the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that our activities are fully compliant with the applicable rules,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFurthermore, meritless complaints like this are commonly filed to harass political opponents and are indicative of the problems in Washington.\u201d\n\nOf particular concern to American Bridge is a Washington Post report from last month that stated Schultz has been \u201claying the groundwork for paid advertising that could debut in the next two months\u201d during \u201ca months-long effort to prepare an independent presidential campaign against the nation\u2019s two-party political system.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy \u2018laying the groundwork for paid advertising,\u2019 Mr. Schultz has gone beyond the scope of the testing-the-water exemption and has become a candidate for federal office,\u201d American Bridge contends.\n\nAmerican Bridge is additionally concerned by a link on Schultz\u2019s website that suggests various ways people can \u201cget involved,\u201d including \u201cvolunteering,\u201d \u201chosting an event\u201d and \u201chelping to spread the word,\u201d though those concerns are not included in the complaint. Schultz is currently in the middle of a book tour, but Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for American Bridge, said those options are more in line with Schultz\u2019s political aspirations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable to pretend that some of those options are about a book tour and not about a campaign,\u201d Bates said.\n\nAmerican Bridge, which was founded by David Brock of Media Matters for America and is financially supported by the likes of George Soros, describes itself as a \u201ca progressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable.\u201d But it has made a special exception for the billionaire former Starbucks CEO \u2015 a self-described former \u201clifelong Democrat\u201d who is now \u201cseriously\u201d considering running for president \u201cas a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system.\u201d\n\nDemocrats fear Schultz could pull votes away from their candidate should he run, improving President Trump\u2019s odds of re-election in 2020. Early polling has indicated he would pull more support from Democrats than Republicans.\n\nSchultz himself has said that he will weigh such fears in his ultimate decision. \u201cI can assure you, no one wants Donald Trump fired more than I,\u201d he recently said during a speech at Purdue University. But American Bridge isn\u2019t waiting to find out where Schultz will land. Already, it has compiled and shopped opposition research on Schultz related to his charitable foundation and Starbucks\u2019 past settlements over \u201cwage and compensation issues.\u201d\n\nNow, it is attempting to bring the FEC into the equation.\n\nIn its complaint, American Bridge cites the FEC\u2019s previous determination that once a candidate \u201chas moved beyond the deliberative process of deciding to become a candidate, and into the process of planning and scheduling public activities designed to heighten his political appeal to the electorate, then \u2026 the activity would cease to be within the exemption, and candidacy would arise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus,\u201d American Bridge contends, \u201ceven a candidate who is careful to craft his public comments to avoid publicly referring to himself as a candidate can trigger candidacy by making expenditures to further his candidacy once a private decision has been made.\u201d\n\nAn FEC spokesperson said over email that the \u201cFederal Election Campaign Act requires that any Commission action on an enforcement complaint be kept strictly confidential until the case is resolved.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandusky-ohio-election-day-paid-holiday_us_5c5f3a3ce4b0eec79b23f7fa": "Late last month, the government of Sandusky, Ohio, did what many believe the federal government should have done long ago: It declared Election Day a paid holiday.\n\nProponents argue that the benefit is clear. If you make it easier for people to show up to the polls by saying they don\u2019t have to work, more people will, strengthening our democracy with greater civic participation.\n\nYet it has proved exceedingly difficult to make Election Day a paid holiday nationwide, despite lawmakers\u2019 various attempts.\n\nSandusky\u2019s solution was simple: Swap city workers\u2019 Columbus Day holiday with the first Tuesday after Nov. 1. The move will affect all municipal workers.\n\n\u201cWe are swapping them to prioritize voting day as a day off so that our employees can vote,\u201d City Manager Eric Wobser told the Sandusky Register.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s also because Columbus Day has become controversial, and many cities have eliminated it as a holiday.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a number of cities have decided to rename the holiday Indigenous Peoples Day as a tribute to the Native peoples who lived on the continent long before Christopher Columbus arrived. The Italian explorer decimated Native populations by killing them directly through force and indirectly through disease.\n\nNegotiating the swap with workers\u2019 unions was only a bit tricky, Wobser told NPR. Union leaders expressed some hesitation because people generally prefer a three-day weekend versus a day off in the middle of the workweek. (Election Day is on a Tuesday thanks to 19th century farmers.) They agreed, though, after understanding the civic benefits, according to NPR.\n\n\u201cA lot\u2019s happened in the last three years that had us thinking a lot about voter access and democracy, and so we thought it was a really natural switch,\u201d the city manager said.\n\nCompared with other developed nations, voter turnout in the United States is not great. But it wasn\u2019t always that way.

Instead, he described the inquiry as an ongoing process of information-sharing between state and county officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following state law and federal law in this procedure,\u201d Whitley said, speaking at a confirmation hearing before a Texas Senate committee.\n\nBut under questioning from Democratic lawmakers, Whitley struggled to explain why, in a press release two weeks ago, his office said 95,000 noncitizens could be on the voter rolls even though that data hadn\u2019t been verified with local election officials. Whitley said he issued the press release because his office does not have investigative authority and he wanted to quickly get the data to officials who could act on it.\n\n\u201cI was confident it was the best data,\u201d Whitley said of the information he received from state officials, adding that he had received assurances it was accurate. Whitley said he did not personally review the data before it was sent out.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) is facing scrutiny over a review of suspected noncitizen voters in Texas.\n\nCounty officials are investigating the list of suspected noncitizens and have already identified substantial errors \u2015 at least 20,000 people have been removed from the list. The county officials say the secretary of state\u2019s office contacted them shortly after sending out the list and informed them the data they\u2019d sent included several people whom the state had already verified as citizens.\n\nLocal officials believe the list of suspected noncitizens may continue to shrink with more investigating, and some have said the unsubstantiated public statements about voter fraud from Whitley and state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) have undermined confidence in elections.\n\nCivil rights groups accused Whitley and Paxton of prematurely sending out unverified data and stirring up fears of voter fraud. County officials can now use that data to request that voters prove their citizenship within 30 days or be removed from the rolls. The groups say the process discriminates against naturalized citizens because the Texas Department of Public Safety does not keep updated citizenship records.\n\nSophia Lin Lakin, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project who is representing plaintiffs suing Whitley over the review, said Whitley\u2019s quick action on the list of suspected noncitizens was reckless.\n\n\u201cSecretary Whitley\u2019s irresponsible decision to forward his purge list to law enforcement authorities knowing that it very likely contained the names of naturalized citizens properly on the rolls is just another indication of the apparent disregard for the immigrant community in Texas that prompted him to initiate a purge program that by its nature threatens the voting rights of naturalized citizens,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitley refused to say his office had made mistakes in the data it sent to state officials. Instead, he said the process of verifying voters\u2019 citizenship was meant to be \u201ccollaborative,\u201d and that his office had always intended for local officials to verify the data.

One of three federal lawsuits filed over the last two weeks to halt the voter inquiry accuses the three officials of conspiring to suppress the voting rights of people of color.\n\nDuring one remarkable exchange with state Sen. Royce West (D), Whitley repeatedly declined to define the term \u201cvoter suppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, I have heard voter suppression talked about,\u201d Whitley said. When West pressed him to define the term, Whitley said his definition was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d He added that anecdotally, he believed it referred to acts that discourage people from voting.\n\nAnecdotally, I have heard voter suppression talked about. Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R)\n\nWhitley\u2019s comments are significant because federal judges have indeed found that Texas lawmakers intentionally discriminated against voters of color \u2015 both through a voter ID law passed in 2013 and via boundaries for electoral districts. (Appeals courts have subsequently upheld revised versions of those measures.) Plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit say Texas\u2019 intentional discrimination is so pronounced that moving forward, the state should have to clear its voting changes with the federal government.\n\n\u201cSecretary Whitley\u2019s testimony today only deepened our concerns regarding the flawed and inaccurate voter purge list that his office sent to counties two weeks ago,\u201d Beth Stevens, voting rights legal director at the Texas Civil Rights Project \u2015 which is also suing Whitley \u2015 said Thursday. \u201cInstead of taking full responsibility for this debacle, he passed the buck to the previous Secretary and the Department of Public Safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost alarming for voters,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cthe Secretary admitted that he sent this list of individuals to county officials and the Attorney General before knowing all of the facts to determine voter eligibility.\u201d\n\nState Sen. John Whitmire (D) appeared briefly at Thursday\u2019s hearing to register his opposition to Whitley\u2019s voter probe, noting that the list targeted an intern in his office. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Whitmire said.\n\nThe experience of Whitmire\u2019s intern, Bel\u00e9n I\u00f1iguez, underscores some of the problems critics pointed out at the hearing. She moved to Austin from the town of Tyler to work at this year\u2019s legislative session.\n\nHaving naturalized last year, I\u00f1iguez feared she might be on the secretary of state\u2019s list of suspected noncitizen voters. A call to Smith County election officials confirmed she was.\n\nBut the letter giving her 30 days to prove her citizenship or have her voter registration revoked went out Jan. 31 to her old address in Tyler, where she never would have received it.\n\n\u201cThere was no freaking way for me to find out that I was on that list other than calling,\u201d I\u00f1iguez told HuffPost.\n\nDespite the concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers, the Republican-majority nominations committee is likely to approve Whitley\u2019s nomination.

The report called on U.K. lawmakers to create regulations to hold tech giants like Facebook accountable for the malicious spread of online information.\n\nLawmakers reviewed a series of internal Facebook documents they obtained late last year from Six4Three, an app developer that filed a lawsuit against Facebook in the United States in 2015. According to the committee, those documents showed Facebook was \u201cwilling to override its users\u2019 privacy settings in order to transfer data\u201d to other big tech companies like Netflix and Spotify. Facebook has stated that it never sold users\u2019 data and that those companies were business partners.\n\nThe report, which is 108 pages, also said Facebook was intentionally \u201cstarving\u201d its competitors by limiting data access to those apps, as alleged in Six4Three\u2019s lawsuit.

The Republican-led state Legislature has other ideas.\n\nThe Utah Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would toss out a grassroots-driven, voter-backed ballot initiative to offer Medicaid benefits to any Utahn earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000 a year for a single person), paid for by raising the sales tax on certain goods from 4.7 percent to 4.85 percent.\n\nThe legislation instead would expand Medicaid to fewer people, enable Utah to receive less federal money for the program and impose limitations on benefits, including work requirements. And the entire plan hinges on a dubious promise of federal approval for aspects of the state Senate bill.\n\nThe Utah GOP clearly is prioritizing overturning the voters, considering the Legislature has been in session since just Monday and the bill made it out its Senate committee Tuesday and to the floor Wednesday. The fact that 53 percent of voters spoke in favor of a full Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in November is not swaying Utah Republican legislators, who have resisted the expansion since it became available in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative, known as Proposition 3, not only received majority support statewide but also in most state Senate districts, the Utah Health Policy Project reported. According to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis of the vote Wednesday, 10 Republican senators representing districts where a majority voted in favor of the expansion are supporting the bill to modify it, including the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Allen Christensen. A plurality of Utahns opposes changing the voter-backed policy, according to a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defer to the will of the people at some point,\u201d said state Rep. Brian King, the minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives and one of 16 Democrats in the 75-member lower chamber of the Utah State Legislature. \u201cWe should not be doing anything to substantively alter that Proposition 3 in a way that delays the implementation one more day.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill sends a message to voters, King said: \u201cWe don\u2019t really care what the people of the state of Utah want to do or say they want us to do at the Legislature. We\u2019re going to do what we want to do. That\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d\n\nThese actions by Utah Republican lawmakers are reminiscent of how then-Gov. Paul LePage (R) defied Maine voters last year by refusing to carry out a Medicaid expansion they approved in 2017. LePage\u2019s successor, Gov. Janet Mills (D), has already begun the process of implementing the expansion. In Idaho, where voters also passed a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, a conservative organization is challenging it before the state Supreme Court.\n\nEfforts by Republicans at the state level to undo or limit the Medicaid expansion, including the seven states that received federal approval for work requirements and the eight more seeking it, mirror the national Republican strategy on health care.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress devoted most of 2017 to attempting and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with plans that would have left millions without health coverage. And in December, a federal judge ruled in favor of 20 GOP state officials who argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in a lawsuit supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nRick Bowmer/Associated Press Tiffiny Malo, left, and Pam Harrison, supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid, at a rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law during the first day of the Utah Legislature on Monday.\n\nThe Utah Senate must vote again on the bill to significantly alter the Medicaid expansion enacted by voters, which it approved once this week against the opposition of all six Democratic senators and one of the chamber\u2019s 23 Republicans. The state House is poised to act quickly on the legislation after the Senate is finished.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving very quickly,\u201d said King, who expects the Utah House will pass the Senate bill by the end of next week.\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert has not taken a public position on the Medicaid bill. In response to questions from HuffPost, Herbert\u2019s office provided a statement from a spokesman.\n\n\u201cGov. Herbert has long supported the kind of common-sense guardrails for Medicaid expansion that are being discussed in the legislature. Many were components of his proposed Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion in 2015; most of these were part of legislation that he signed into law last general session. His primary concerns are that the state honor the will of the voters to fill the hole in the social safety net by helping those under the poverty line without health insurance and to implement without delay,\u201d Paul Edwards said in the statement.\n\nLast week, Herbert said he believed the state should allow the expansion to move forward as approved by voters and then be revisited at a later date. During his State of the State address Thursday, Herbert said only that \u201cthe much-needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay.\u201d\n\nBecause Republicans have supermajorities in the Utah House and Senate, however, the GOP would have the votes to override a veto even if Herbert decided to oppose the Medicaid legislation.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and the federal government finances at least 90 percent of the cost. This expansion was meant to be in place nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate. To date, 14 states have declined it. Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voters all approved expansion via ballot initiative last year, but the program is not yet in place in those states. Under the terms of the Utah initiative, benefits are supposed to become available April 1.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative was straightforward in its approach by simply instructing the state to join the Medicaid expansion without any changes to the state\u2019s existing program or the need for federal approval. The Utah Governor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget assessed that the sales tax increase would raise more than enough money to finance the state\u2019s 10 percent share of the expansion\u2019s cost, although it noted that the revenue and costs in future years may not match up.\n\nBy contrast, the Utah Senate bill would trigger a complicated and uncertain process that would cover fewer people under Medicaid. The Senate began action on the measure before the Legislature\u2019s budget scorekeepers could analyze the legislation\u2019s effects, but it is designed to limit the Medicaid expansion\u2019s reach. That\u2019s despite the fact that the measure would leave the sales tax increase in place while also imposing a tax on hospitals that alone is intended to be large enough to cover the state\u2019s entire share of the expense of Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder the Senate legislation, Medicaid benefits would be available only to those with incomes below the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person. Utahns with incomes higher than that would continue to have access to subsidized private coverage via the health insurance exchange in the state. Unlike the Medicaid expansion voters approved, the state would receive about 70 percent of the funding for the partial Medicaid expansion from the federal government instead of the 90 percent offered by a full expansion.\n\nThe bill lacks detail on many key elements of the modified expansion, leaving those to the state\u2019s executive branch and federal officials to hash out. In order to maintain April 1 as the day benefits would come online, legislative Republicans are counting on all of that happening on an extraordinarily expedited basis.\n\n\u201cThis entire thing is being rammed through the Senate and the House as quickly as possible. It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters, that they\u2019re disrespecting voters by doing so,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a Washington-based organization that supported Medicaid ballot initiatives in Utah, Idaho, Maine, Montana and Nebraska over the past two years.\n\nIt is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project\n\nThe Herbert administration would have to resolve all the outstanding questions the bill poses and the federal government would have to approve waivers for standard Medicaid rules in less than two months, which is much more quickly than it typically acts.\n\n\u201cNothing about how the federal government moves and operates gives me much hope or assurance that you\u2019re going to get a waiver at all, much less one in a time frame that is going to be less than 60 days,\u201d King said.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty pertains to the funding. Under the legislation, Utah would ask the federal government to break precedent by providing the full 90 percent funding for a partial expansion. The Trump administration last year rejected such requests from Arkansas and Massachusetts, following the Obama administration\u2019s policy against partial expansions.\n\nUtah has even tried this before. Herbert signed legislation last year approving a partial expansion and submitted a request for approval to federal authorities. That would have covered about half as many people as a full Medicaid expansion. The state withdrew its application after the ballot initiative passed.\n\nThe new bill also calls for work requirements and for locking out enrollees who fail to meet them, but it does not specify what they would be and how they would be enforced. It also would cap enrollment for otherwise eligible Utahns if cost projections for the expansion exceed the amount of money appropriated for the year.\n\nThe attempt to overturn voters on Medicaid expansion comes a month after Herbert signed legislation to replace a medical marijuana initiative voters approved last year with a new law. In the aftermath of voters passing the marijuana and Medicaid measures, Utah lawmakers also are eying changes to the ballot initiative process to let the Legislature alter voter-backed policies before they take effect.\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from a spokesman for Utah Gov.

But they are directing their ire at another person too: Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n\nCollins, who is up for re-election in 2020, was pivotal to Kavanaugh\u2019s narrow October confirmation to the court. All but one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), voted against Kavanaugh, in large part out of concerns that he would roll back abortion rights. Collins, who says she supports abortion rights, defended her vote by saying she believed he would follow Supreme Court precedent \u2015 that is, preserve Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut Kavanaugh voted Thursday to let a Louisiana law take effect that would have left the state with just one physician allowed to perform abortions \u2015 a break from precedent, as the law is virtually identical to a Texas anti-abortion law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. He was on the losing side of the court\u2019s 5-4 decision, in which the majority said the restrictions must remain on hold while challengers appeal a lower court decision in favor of the law. But Kavanaugh took the extra step of writing a dissent, saying he would have let the law take effect.\n\nDemand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, is already up with a digital ad this weekend in Maine highlighting Collins\u2019 vote for Kavanaugh.

And that\u2019s exactly how she\u2019s going to continue to proceed.\u201d\n\nBut abortion rights groups aren\u2019t letting Collins off the hook.\n\n\u201cWe were called crazy and hysterical for suggesting he was hostile to #roevwade even though his record was clear,\u201d Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, posted on Instagram. \u201cSusan Collins, you own this.\u201d\n\nAmelia Penniman, a spokesperson for the progressive research group American Bridge, said Kavanaugh wouldn\u2019t even be on the court if it weren\u2019t for Collins\u2019 deciding vote.\n\n\u201cIt has always been crystal clear that he intended to use his position to attack abortion rights, and thanks to Susan Collins, women will now pay the price,\u201d Penniman said in a statement. \u201cThis will go down in history as a key portion of her legacy, and it\u2019s a reality that she will have to answer for next year when she faces voters.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-emergency-tantrum_us_5c62fbf3e4b00ba63e4b0a53": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While the six previous presidents collectively declared dozens of national emergencies, Donald Trump\u2019s one over a border wall would be the first to finance an unpopular construction project that congresses in both his own country and a neighboring one have refused to pay for.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House said Trump would sign a spending bill to keep the government funded \u2015 but he would also declare a national emergency since Congress wasn\u2019t going to give him the billions he wants for a wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\nTrump has been warning for months that he would declare an emergency if Congress failed to appropriate $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico. He repeated the threat at a recent re-election rally in El Paso, Texas.\n\n\u201cAs I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee,\u201d he said of a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.375 billion for border barriers. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re building the wall anyway.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, though, choosing to declare a national emergency would likely trigger a law from Congress finding his declaration invalid, lawsuits challenging its legality, or both.\n\n\u201cThe National Emergencies Act does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because Congress chooses not to give him the toys that he likes,\u201d said Greg Chen, the head of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the legal challenges would be filed instantly,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on national emergencies at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nOf late, Trump and his allies have argued that national emergencies are nothing extraordinary, that every previous president going back to the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976 has used it and that nearly three dozen are still in force.\n\nOn Sunday he tweeted to his 58 million followers a statement from Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.): \u201cThere have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.\u201d\n\nYet what the White House and Trump\u2019s defenders do not mention is that no previous president has declared a national emergency for a pet project that most Americans oppose, that Congress has refused to support and that he promised during his campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because Congress chooses not to give him the toys that he likes. Greg Chen, American Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nDouglas Rivlin, a spokesman for the pro-immigration group America\u2019s Voice, said Trump is primarily trying to work up his hard-core base by painting immigrants as criminals, just as he did in the weeks leading up to the November midterm elections.\n\nRivlin added that it was ironic that an absurd campaign promise has now become the singular focus of his administration. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a joke. It\u2019s always been a promise that didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an applause line. And yet it is driving national policy at this point.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump did not offhandedly joke about forcing Mexico to pay for a massive, 30-foot-tall, reinforced concrete wall. He promised that he would force Mexico to pay for it \u2014 literally hundreds of times in his rallies, and even in interviews when he was asked whether he was serious.\n\nIn a March 2016 memo, Trump claimed he would force Mexico to make \u201ca one-time payment of $5-$10 billion\u201d or face garnishment of remittances from Mexican immigrants to their families in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThat fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cBut even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt.\u201d\n\nUpon taking office, Trump did not once broach the idea of Mexico paying in his conversations with that country\u2019s leaders, according to the Mexican government. In fact, in his first conversation with Mexico\u2019s then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto days after taking office, Trump acknowledged that Mexico would never pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly to avoid hurting Trump\u2019s standing with his supporters.\n\nAfter that phone call, more than a year passed before Trump started demanding a wall, only this time from U.S. taxpayers and Congress, which led to his claims starting in October that he had the power simply to ignore Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen the rules don\u2019t suit him, he breaks the rules, and then it gets tied up in courts,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cThis has been the pattern of his life.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the exclusive role given to Congress in the Constitution to decide whether and how much to spend for any given priority, Chen said.\n\nThat fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn\u2019t want to do. But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt. Douglas Rivlin, spokesman, America\u2019s Voice\n\nAll but a handful of the previous five dozen emergency declarations over the past four decades have imposed trade restrictions or other economic sanctions against nations for their aggressive behavior and human rights abuses.\n\nA May 22, 1997, declaration by Bill Clinton prohibited new investment in Burma. An April 3, 2014, declaration by Barack Obama imposed sanctions on leaders of South Sudan. The very first emergency \u2014 which is in place to this day \u2014 was declared by Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on Iran after the 1979 revolution.\n\nOnly a handful of the declarations have dealt with national policy outside of targeted sanctions. One, declared by Ronald Reagan in 1983, reinstated a ban on the export of technologies that could be used for military purposes. Congress had allowed the ban to lapse but did not oppose his use of the Emergencies Act to put it back into force.\n\nAnother came in 2005, when George W. Bush, without technically declaring an emergency, decreed the suspension of a requirement to pay workers involved in the Hurricane Katrina recovery a certain minimum wage. Democrats and some Republicans did object to that one, and set a vote in the House to disapprove it. Bush rescinded his decree the day before the scheduled vote.\n\nNot one of the previous emergencies, however, did anything close to what Trump is trying to do: pay for a project not only without Congress\u2019 approval, but after Congress has specifically rejected his request several times.\n\n\u201cThe law was intended to authorize a president to take action in a crisis that was unfolding too quickly for Congress to respond,\u201d Chen said. \u201cCongress has, in fact, made a decision. Congress has chosen not to give him the funds that he would like.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear if or when Trump would actually declare an emergency. Republican senators have already expressed their fears that enough of them would side with Democrats on the issue that a law rescinding the emergency would clear Congress, forcing Trump to back down or veto it \u2014 a choice that would likely lead to an attempt to override the veto. White House officials would say only that Trump is considering all his options and that he would do everything necessary to deal with the \u201ccrisis\u201d at the border.\n\nChen, though, said that Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 threatening an emergency, but only if Congress refused to give him what he wanted \u2014 have undermined the legal basis for one.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/el-paso-trump-rally-carnival-of-lies_us_5c62ed0ae4b00ba63e4ae43b": "EL PASO, Texas \u2014 As thousands of Donald Trump supporters lined up outside the El Paso County Coliseum Monday afternoon, waiting to see the president hold his first official re-election campaign rally near the U.S.-Mexico border, the MAGA merchants were in a frenzy.\n\nSome vendors pulled carts full of red or camouflage \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, yelling, \u201cTen dollars, cash or credit!\u201d Others made elaborate displays of flags for sale.

In his State of the Union address last week he claimed, falsely, that border fencing that was built south of the city in 2010 transformed El Paso from a dangerous place into a safe one.\n\nIts Republican mayor lashed out at the president last week for his falsehood. El Paso\u2019s declining crime rate started well before the border fencing was built.\n\nBut Trump repeated the lie Monday night. And for his audience, the lie was now the truth.\n\n\u201cOnce they built that wall, it was amazing how statistically the violence started going down,\u201d 39-year-old El Paso resident Michael Blanco, who owns an accounting business, told HuffPost outside the coliseum. \u201cI\u2019m a complete witness of it.

O\u2019Rourke, a potential presidential candidate, held a protest a few blocks from Trump\u2019s rally Monday night.\n\nThe president taunted O\u2019Rourke from the stage, claiming that the O\u2019Rourke rally attracted a paltry few hundred attendees. El Paso police later estimated that well over 10,000 people attended.\n\nTrump spoke for over an hour \u2014 about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, about Hillary Clinton, about the Green New Deal and about how \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country.\u201d\n\nNick Martin, an investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, watched the speech and noticed someone he recognized sitting in the front row, wearing a baseball hat and an eye patch: Elmer Stewart Rhodes.\n\nRhodes is the founder of the far-right militia group the Oath Keepers.

There they were met by a small group of teenage protesters carrying signs reading \u201cTrump is a lying corrupt racist\u201d and \u201cAbolish I.C.E.\u201d\n\nMany Trump supporters cursed at the teens, yelling, \u201cFuck you,\u201d and started a loud chant of \u201cTrump!

Trump for President and two related campaign committees raised a total of $130 million over the past two years, according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission, with $26 million of that transferred to the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, was outraised $90 million by its Democratic counterpart. Republicans, who held the House since the 2010 election, lost 40 seats and control of the chamber.\n\n\u201cTrump darkens the sun. There is nothing else out there,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a GOP consultant and longtime Trump critic, adding that Trump\u2019s targeting and \u201cbleeding\u201d of small donors meant congressional candidates were less likely to get those contributions.\n\n\u201cSmall donors, those giving $20 or $50, are donors on a limited budget,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTrump has decapitated the party.

In previous remarks, Trump has boasted of how hard he worked for GOP candidates with dozens of rallies last summer and fall.\n\n\u201cThis vigorous campaigning stopped the \u2018blue wave\u2019 that they talked about,\u201d he said the morning after the midterm elections while calling the results \u201cvery close to complete victory.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed frequently that his rallies around the country helped Republican candidates, even though the candidates typically appeared on stage with Trump for only a few minutes of an hourlong event at venues that featured primarily Trump signage and placards.\n\nOne Republican official familiar with the House campaigns said that Trump\u2019s insistence on making the focus of the election himself, both in terms of fundraising as well as the themes, was not helpful.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of the backlash of Trump without getting much of the benefit,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity, pointing to Trump\u2019s hammering on illegal immigrants forming caravans to \u201cinvade\u201d the United States as particularly problematic.\n\nRepublicans lost and nearly lost races in California, Texas and Florida because of Trump, the official said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that immigration hurt us in a bunch of places.\u201d\n\nIn a news release Thursday night, the campaign boasted that it had raised $21 million in just the final three months of 2018. \u201cThese totals continue a record fundraising streak for a president\u2019s first eight quarters in office,\u201d the release stated.\n\nWhat the release failed to state was that Trump holds the \u201crecord\u201d because no previous candidate was raising money for re-election so early in his term. President Barack Obama did not start his re-election campaign until April 2011. President George W. Bush opened his re-election account in May 2003.\n\nTrump, in contrast, opened his re-election campaign account the day he was inaugurated in January 2017 and began staging rallies almost immediately. Previous presidents spent their first two years raising money for their parties, for their parties\u2019 congressional committees and, at times, for individual candidates.\n\n\u201cMost presidents help raise money for candidates,\u201d said Al Cardenas, once the state Republican Party chairman in Florida and a close ally of the Bush family. \u201cIs there really justification to suck all the oxygen out of the room so quickly?\u201d\n\nTrump did donate $2,000 each to 106 House and Senate candidates in July, but with House campaigns today often costing millions of dollars, those were of token benefit at best. Trump could have, had he wanted, spent far more money on \u201cindependent expenditures\u201d to benefit candidates in tight races, had he done so without coordinating with the campaign in question.\n\nHe did not, however, and instead most of the money he raised went toward fundraising costs, staging rallies around the country and selling Trump-branded campaign gear. Hundreds of thousands more went to Trump properties that he personally profits from \u2015 $150,167 in the final three months of 2018 to Trump Tower alone, where he rents office space from himself.\n\n\u201cHe had all the money in the world,\u201d Wilson said, adding that some of that could have made the difference in races that were lost by thousands or even hundreds of votes. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he wouldn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump did headline fundraisers for both the NRCC and the National Senatorial Republican Committee as well as help raise $325 million for the Republican National Committee, which helps Republican candidates up and down the ballot.\n\nThat help, though, comes with strict rules and limits attached, and is not as beneficial to the candidates as money raised by the candidates themselves, officials agreed.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-25th-amendment-jim-acosta_n_5c66619ce4b033a799411703": "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tweet made an odd assertion about the Constitution.\n\nQuoting Alan Dershowitz on Fox News, the Trump tweet suggested that invoking the 25th Amendment \u2015 which has the procedures for the removal and replacement of the president \u2015 is unconstitutional ... despite actually being in the Constitution:\n\nTrump Tweeted:\n\n\u201cTrying to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing...which happens in third world countries.

A 1993 yearbook lists him as a freshman that year, and he was featured as a Kappa Alpha member starting in the 1994 yearbook. The fraternity, which is still active at Millsaps, looks to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as its spiritual leader.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 1994, members of Kappa Alpha and another fraternity \u201cdonned Afro wigs and tied large Confederate flags around their necks,\u201d according to an article in The Clarion-Ledger at the time. Some of them were also reportedly in blackface. The fraternity brothers \u201cgot into a shouting match\u201d over the incident with some black students. The state fraternity leader defended the chapter, saying it was \u201cgetting a bad rap\u201d and blamed a few rogue individuals.\n\nMembers of the Black Students Association asked for the fraternity to be suspended.\n\nOne of the students leveling the charges against Kappa Alpha was Kiese Laymon, the opinions editor of the student paper. Even before the incident, in August, Laymon wrote a piece about Kappa Alpha\u2019s reputation, lumping the fraternity in with the KKK and neo-Nazis in their love of the Confederate flag.\n\n\u201cAt Millsaps, I know we\u2019ve overcome racism,\u201d Laymon wrote sarcastically in a column, \u201cand if the word \u2018nigger\u2019 is ever muttered, it could only be echoed from the walls of the Kappa Alpha house.\u201d\n\nIn response, a month later, the paper published an anonymous letter from a Kappa Alpha member who acknowledged Laymon was right about the attitudes of his fraternity \u2015 but said that, privately, not all of them were racist and sexist and did want things to change.\n\nIn 1995, the Kappa Alpha yearbook page showed a group of students standing with a Confederate flag in military attire. It\u2019s not clear if Reeves is in the photo, although he was also pictured as a member of the fraternity that year.\n\nThe images were first uncovered and published by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge on its website, the American Ledger.\n\nMillsaps College yearbook\n\nIn the 1993 yearbook, before Reeves pledged, the fraternity\u2019s page showed students in a form of blackface, mocking Pacific Islanders \u2015 with darkened faces, wearing grass skirts and leis \u2015 and wearing Confederate flag paint.\n\nMillsaps College Yearbook, 1993 In the 1993 Millsaps yearbook, there was a photo on the Kappa Alpha page featuring two students in blackface.\n\nCollege yearbooks are coming back to haunt politicians.\n\nThree of Virginia\u2019s top state officials are currently embroiled in scandals about their use or acceptance of blackface. It started with the governor\u2019s yearbook page, featuring a photo of two men, one in blackface and one in a KKK outfit. (Democrat Ralph Northam insists he isn\u2019t one of the men pictured.) Since then, the Democratic attorney general has admitted to once wearing blackface at a college party, and the GOP leader of the state Senate edited a college yearbook containing racist pictures and slurs.\n\nEven if they\u2019re not pictured in blackface, they seemed to gladly accept a privileged white culture that found entertainment in the racist pastime.\n\nIn 2013, Reeves spoke at an event for Sons of Confederate Veterans, a neo-Confederate organization that claims the Civil War was not about slavery.

His transition team ignored ethics officials and refused to abide by any ethics guidelines. He waved away anti-nepotism laws in elevating his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, to positions of power with no relevant experience. He attracted aides who could not pass security clearance background checks. And most important, he refused to divest from his multibillion-dollar real estate business, allowing foreign governments, lobbyists and corporations seeking government action to directly pay the president.\n\n\u201cThey said they were going to drain the swamp,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said. \u201cThey moved into the swamp.

Those provisions include requirements that presidential transitions teams create ethics guidelines, vesting new investigative authority in the Office of Government Ethics, mandating disclosure of ethics waivers and other filings and codifying previous executive orders on ethics. The bill would also express the sense of Congress that presidents should divest from their businesses.\n\nRepublicans have expressed outright hostility to the bill, which also includes provisions on voting rights and campaign finance reform. Democrats are pushing these new executive branch ethics laws to \u201cexact political retribution on the president,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), sought to tar Shaub, who quit his position at the Office of Government Ethics over administration\u2019s refusal to abide by ethics precedents, as a partisan hypocrite. The back-and-forth, however, ended up only reinforcing the arguments that Shaub and Democrats have been making for the bill\u2019s ethics provisions.\n\nShaub previously opposed Meadows\u2019 effort to provide the Office of Government Ethics with investigative authority during a committee hearing in 2015, when Barack Obama was president, Meadows noted. But now Shaub has endorsed H.R. 1, which includes that very provision.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find why all of a sudden you would have this newfound interest to have investigative authority if it were not directed at this President of the United States,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nShaub admitted that Meadows was right then and explained that his position changed after \u201cwatching for two years somebody prove to me that the executive branch ethics program was much weaker than I ever thought it was.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/howard-schultz-cnn-democrats_us_5c6325bde4b0a8731aeae8c2": "Alex Wong via Getty Images Howard Schultz is just the second potential presidential candidate to receive CNN's town hall treatment this year.\n\nTuesday night, CNN is scheduled to provide an enormous platform to former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in the form of one of the network\u2019s signature town halls. It will be the second CNN town hall of the 2020 presidential cycle, and the first given to a billionaire who has yet to formally say whether he even wants to run for president.\n\nTo Zac Petkanas, a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton, the whole thing feels like \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the media rushing to confer legitimacy onto a billionaire candidate,\u201d Petkanas told HuffPost. \u201cIt just shows that certain elements of the media have learned absolutely nothing from their role in elevating a Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAs it stands now, Schultz is remarkably unpopular. Since telling \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month that he was \u201cseriously\u201d considering running for president \u201cas a centrist independent,\u201d he has been heckled in bookstores, ridiculed online and criticized for weighing a presidential campaign that early polling shows would improve Trump\u2019s re-election odds. According to CNN\u2019s own polling, Schultz ranks last in favorability when compared to 10 potential Democratic candidates. But media outlets around the country can\u2019t get enough \u2015 and have continued to attentively cover his cross-country listening tour, where he is also promoting his new book.\n\nThat in itself doesn\u2019t bother Petkanas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is saying that he\u2019s not deserving of coverage,\u201d Petkanas said. \u201cThe question is, why is he being given this sort of platform that is typically reserved for candidates when he\u2019s not an announced candidate?\u201d\n\nPetkanas isn\u2019t alone in feeling that way. Soledad O\u2019Brien publicly lambasted her former network\u2019s decision when it was announced last week. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight called it \u201cdubious.\u201d Privately, many Democratic operatives and staffers agree.

Additionally, CNN announced Monday that it will host a town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) next week.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s hard for Petkanas and others working within the Democratic Party not to wonder whether the same media dynamics that propelled Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016 have kicked into high gear once more. By the time Trump announced he was running for president almost four years ago, he had already been gifted years of free news coverage, which he used to push Obama-focused conspiracy theories and inflate his own brand.\n\n\u201cWhen he announced [he was running] for office, he deserved to be covered and treated like a candidate, but that\u2019s not what built and elevated Donald Trump,\u201d Petkanas said. \u201cIt was the coverage before he announced as a candidate.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/payday-lenders-sure-have-a-cozy-relationship-with-the-trump-administration_n_5c65d5e3e4b0233af9732deb": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see the potential influence that predatory lenders may have,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nA company that defrauded customers but only got a slap on the wrist from the Trump administration also made a large donation to the president\u2019s 2017 inaugural committee.\n\nLast month, Enova International, an online payday lender that operates the brands NetCredit and CashNetUSA, agreed to pay a $3 million fine for illegally taking money from customers\u2019 bank accounts and failing to honor loan extensions. But the settlement included no refunds for the victims.\n\nPayday lenders as an industry donated more than $1 million to the inauguration, according to the liberal group Allied Progress, as well as tens of thousands to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. The Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group for the industry, last year started holding its annual conferences at a Trump hotel in Florida.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced it would rescind parts of a new federal regulation that had been designed to rein in abusive lending practices that lead people to take out loan after loan and sink into debt.\n\nFavorable treatment for payday lenders is consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s pro-business ideology, however, and there\u2019s no indication that donations have directly led to favorable treatment. But the donations are not a coincidence, either.\n\nConsumer advocates have complained that under Trump, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2015 which was created during the Obama years in large part to go after payday lenders\u2015 has drastically scaled back its regulatory mission and been softer on bad actors.\n\nThe regulation that the CFPB said it would rescind last week would have required small-dollar lenders like CashNetUSA to make sure their customers can pay them back \u2015 which would fundamentally disrupt the business model.\n\n\u201cWith a couple of exceptions nearly every enforcement settlement that we see makes you scratch your head and say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they pay more, why didn\u2019t consumers get anything?\u2019\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nAs for the campaign contributions, Saunders said, \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see the potential influence that predatory lenders may have.\u201d\n\nThe bureau said Enova earned \u201cmillions\u201d by illegally debiting customers\u2019 accounts without authorization, in some cases sticking customers with bank fees. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the CFPB said the bureau doesn\u2019t monitor political donations and that the people making decisions on the Enova case had no knowledge of the company\u2019s donation before HuffPost asked about it.\n\nThe regulation that the CFPB said it would rescind last week would have required small-dollar lenders like CashNetUSA to make sure their customers can pay them back \u2015 which would fundamentally disrupt the business model.\n\nPayday lenders typically require borrowers to allow debits from their bank accounts or sign a postdated check, and their customers are often so strapped for cash that the first loan rolls over into a series of additional, costlier loans, according to CFPB research. While the product can be helpful for someone without access to regular credit, with hefty fees the loans essentially bear triple-digit interest rates that are outright illegal in a number of states.\n\nIn its financial disclosures, Enova said demand for its product is fueled in part by \u201cstagnant to declining growth in the household income for working-class individuals.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Trump appointed his budget director, Mike Mulvaney, to also be the acting director of the consumer bureau, despite (or because of) the fact that Mulvaney opposed its creation in the first place. The former Republican congressman intervened in one investigation of a payday lender last year to drop charges that would have resulted in $8 million worth of restitution to the company\u2019s customers, Reuters reported in June. The company, South Carolina-based Security Group Inc., was found to have harassed customers at their homes and jobs in an effort to collect debts. It agreed to pay a $5 million fine.\n\nAs a former congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney ranked among the top recipients of campaign contributions from the payday lending industry. He has said that when he served in the House, he was more likely to listen to lobbyists if they contributed to his campaign. He proposed eliminating the consumer bureau and called it a sick joke. Mulvaney has since left the bureau to become Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff.\n\nAs a recently as 2006, the payday industry\u2019s political spending favored Democrats, but has since tilted heavily toward Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-donald-trump-stephen-colbert-boo_us_5c628326e4b04a5c2b30f421": "John Oliver suggested on Monday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d that President Donald Trump may win re-election in 2020.\n\nAnd Colbert\u2019s audience pantomime booed the host of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d\n\nColbert had earlier noted that \u201cwe just passed the midterm point in Trump\u2019s hopefully first and only term and some people are saying the end is in sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t have that kind of optimism,\u201d Oliver responded. \u201cTo say we\u2019re halfway through his presidency, I think, is to ignore the concept of a second term possibility.

Farrow said the publisher targeted \u201cat least one other prominent journalist.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors confirmed in December that they had granted Pecker and AMI immunity in their investigation into hush-money payments made prior to the 2016 presidential election by former Donald Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Precise terms of that agreement, however, were not publicized.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the agreement stipulated that the publisher commit no crimes for three years.\n\nYet in his Medium blog post, titled \u201cNo thank you, Mr. Pecker,\u201d Bezos laid out a series of startling emails he says he received from AMI representatives. They included a threat allegedly sent from the publisher\u2019s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, about nine sensitive images including a \u201cd*ck pick.\u201d Howard was also involved in the Cohen investigation and immunity deal.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison last year after pleading guilty to multiple criminal charges including two campaign finance violations. One of those counts involved AMI \u2015 the publisher had admitted to paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump. The publisher then sat on the story, preventing damage to the Trump campaign.\n\nPecker and Trump are longtime friends.\n\nAn investigator for Bezos told the Post that he believed that sensitive texts previously published by the National Enquirer were leaked by the brother of Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor in a relationship with Bezos, who is divorcing his wife. The brother is said to be a Trump supporter. It is not clear whether he might be responsible for leaking the photos as well.\n\nAccording to Bezos, Pecker was \u201capoplectic\u201d about a Washington Post investigation into his companies \u2015 particularly research being done on links between AMI and the Saudi royal family. The publisher demanded that the Post owner release a canned statement claiming there is \u201cno knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces,\u201d Bezos said.\n\nOther news outlets have reported a connection between AMI and the Saudis in the past. According to AP, the publisher shared an early copy of a one-off magazine extolling the kingdom\u2019s crown prince with the Saudi Embassy in Washington. The fawning publication was widely distributed during the prince\u2019s U.S. tour last year.\n\nAMI said it has launched an investigation into Bezos\u2019 claims of attempted blackmail, but insisted Friday morning that the company had acted \u201clawfully.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-non-citizen-voting_us_5c5dd26fe4b0eec79b2336ff": "A 66-year-old North Carolina woman was sentenced Thursday to two months in federal prison for helping her boyfriend at the time, a noncitizen, vote, even though federal prosecutors conceded she didn\u2019t check a box on his voter registration form indicating he was a citizen.\n\nThe woman, Denslo Allen Paige, was the only U.S. citizen charged among a wave of indictments last summer from the office of Robert Higdon, a Trump appointee for the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina. She is the first among those charged to receive a prison sentence.\n\nPaige, who works at Walmart, told HuffPost in August that she went with her boyfriend to an early voting site shortly before the 2016 election to see if he was eligible to vote because he had been talking a lot about politics. She said she wasn\u2019t sure whether her boyfriend, a legal permanent resident, was eligible to vote, but because she had volunteered as a seasonal poll worker in the past (and was paid a stipend), she figured someone at the polling place would tell him if he was ineligible. When no one stopped him, he voted.\n\nPaige said she never checked a box on the form indicating he was a citizen, but a copy of the form obtained by HuffPost shows the box was checked. At a sentencing hearing Thursday, Sebastian Kielmanovich, an assistant U.S. attorney, said he believed Paige had indeed not indicated her boyfriend was a citizen, according to a transcript obtained by HuffPost. He noted the boyfriend may have even presented a green card to poll workers.\n\n\u201cI believe the statement she made is true that it was left blank, but somebody later checked it. So it\u2019s not just the defendant and Mr. Espinosa; there\u2019s yet a third person who had to have checked \u2018Yes\u2019 after the fact; highly concerning, alarming, and the subject of our ongoing review,\u201d Kielmanovich told U.S. District Judge Louise Wood Flanagan.\n\nBut even though Kielmanovich believed Paige had not checked the box, he said she \u201cshould have known better\u201d because she had spent time as a poll worker. He said Paige and her boyfriend were essentially testing the election system to see what they could get away with.\n\n\u201cThey were just trying to get away with it and see what would happen. And it did work because it was registered,\u201d Kielmanovich said.\n\nI wasn\u2019t saying: Go down there and see if you can vote. I wanted to find out if he could. I didn\u2019t know. Denslo Allen Paige\n\nPaige, who pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting voting by a noncitizen, will serve a year of supervised release after her prison sentence and pay a $250 fine. She had faced a maximum prison sentence of five years and up to a $250,000 fine.\n\nReached by telephone Friday, Paige declined to comment. Jay Todd, a public defender appointed to represent Paige, also declined to be interviewed.\n\nAllison Riggs, a senior voting rights attorney at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice in North Carolina, said she believed Paige got a harsher sentence than the others because of her prior work in elections. Still, she said, Higdon is wasting prosecutorial resources in pursuing people like Paige who were clearly confused.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this witch hunt to sort of throw prison sentences and claim that there\u2019s voter fraud, but it\u2019s never what they actually claim. It\u2019s not instances of mass numbers of noncitizens claiming they can vote,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t trying to steal an election. She was trying to make someone she loved feel empowered. Have his voice heard. Hardly nefarious intent.\u201d\n\nWhen Paige spoke in court on Thursday, she said she had never been trained about whether legal permanent residents could vote when she was a poll worker.\n\n\u201cThe reason it happened is because there was no training about whether or not legal aliens could vote \u2015 never \u2015 all of the elections I\u2019ve ever worked. And I truly didn\u2019t know, being a U.S. citizen myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t saying: Go down there and see if you can vote. I wanted to find out if he could. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTodd told Flanagan the manual given to volunteer workers contained little information about whether noncitizens could vote. The circumstance with Paige and her boyfriend, he said, was clearly a mistake, not fraud.\n\nHigdon\u2019s prosecution of alleged noncitizen voters is under scrutiny because many of the cases appear to be instances in which someone voted based on confusion or a misunderstanding. Several of the people sentenced so far have been punished with a fine. Some have wondered why Higdon\u2019s office chose to pursue these cases but not evidence of absentee ballot fraud North Carolina officials sent his office in 2017.\n\nSimilar absentee ballot fraud is alleged to have occurred in 2018, and state officials are probing whether a new election in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District could be warranted because of it.\n\nHigdon, who has declined to comment on the plea deals that resulted in a fine, released a statement Friday praising Paige\u2019s sentence. He referred to Paige as an \u201celection official,\u201d even though she was only paid a stipend as a volunteer seasonal poll worker.\n\nKielmanovich told Flanagan that even though Paige had worked as an election official in the past, she was acting in her capacity as a private citizen during the 2016 incident. Paige, he said, didn\u2019t have authority or access to anything more than a normal person would have.\n\n\u201cWhen a non-citizen votes in a federal election it serves to dilute and devalue the vote of American citizens and places the decision making authority of the American electorate in the hands of those who have no right to make those choices,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case is particularly disturbing as the defendant worked for the Board of Elections. My office will do its part to protect the rights of every American citizen to cast their vote freely and to have it counted fairly.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-voter-fraud-allegations_us_5c54cd7ae4b0871047537a1f": "A top Texas official is walking back inflammatory accusations of massive voter fraud in the state. But as the claims unravel in the face of tough scrutiny, the damage they caused may be impossible to undo. That may be exactly the point.\n\n\n\nTexas Secretary of State David Whitley and Attorney General Ken Paxton, both Republicans, told county election officials last week that they suspected there were 95,000 noncitizens on their voting rolls, 58,000 of whom appeared to have voted in one or more elections since 1996. But that claim, which was amplified by President Donald Trump, is quickly falling apart.\n\nOn Tuesday, Whitley\u2019s office conceded that at least 20,000 of the registered voters flagged as potential noncitizens actually had had their citizenship verified. And there may be more. Paxton, who blasted out a news release with Whitley\u2019s findings suggesting there was fraud, has not said anything since the numbers have come under scrutiny.\n\n\n\nCounty election officials are investigating the names further and suspect there may be more eligible voters, including naturalized citizens, on the list.\n\n\n\nBut even as it becomes clear that Paxton and Whitley exaggerated the extent of voter fraud, it may not matter.\n\nVOTER FRAUD ALERT: The @TXsecofstate discovered approx 95,000 individuals identified by DPS as non-U.S. citizens have a matching voter registration record in TX, approx 58,000 of whom have voted in TX elections. Any illegal vote deprives Americans of their voice. \u2014 Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) January 25, 2019\n\nTo many, the debacle in Texas is a just the latest chapter in a story that has played out over and over again in several states across the country in recent years. An official or activist group will make a salacious claim of illegal voting using unverified information and grab headlines before the claim is investigated and debunked in the ensuing months. Almost always, the claim turns out to be either wildly exaggerated or untrue, but it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2015 people remember only the original, scintillating accusation. While several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem, politicians use the simmering uncertainty about election integrity to justify new voting restrictions.\n\nIn Texas, the investigation of suspected noncitizens comes after a surge in Latino voter turnout in November and a pending bill in the Texas Legislature to require proof of citizenship when someone registers to vote.\n\nLorraine Minnite, a Rutgers professor who has studied many allegations of voter fraud, said what\u2019s happening in Texas was part of a \u201cvery familiar pattern\u201d that she\u2019s observed over two decades.\n\n\u201cIt almost doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re not correct, because they just keep saying it,\u201d said Minnite, the author of The Myth of Voter Fraud. \u201cThe political strategy is almost to deliberately produce bad information, and then you go out with it and it\u2019s hard to debunk right away.\u201d By the time that happens, the misinformation is etched into voters\u2019 psyches.\n\n58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2019\n\nDebunking a claim of voter fraud is a complicated process that may involve going through volumes of voter registration files, assessing methodology, reviewing voter registration forms and contacting voters. It can take months. In Texas, many local election officials say they are going to proceed very slowly and cautiously with checking the list Whitley\u2019s office provided.\n\nThe complexity of verifying a voter fraud claim, combined with how long it takes, adds to the likelihood that people will stop paying attention.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this lag between the time when the allegations are made and when the actual investigations are completed. It\u2019s in that lag period that the perceptions solidify to ... \u2018Yes, this a problem, and we need to do something about it,\u2019\u201d said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who has analyzed many allegations of election fraud. \u201cBy the time we actually get to the follow-up story, if there is one... by then it\u2019s too late. People don\u2019t connect the stories. They just believe whatever the initial story was.\u201d\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in 2016, in which the popular vote went to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but he has offered no evidence to support that claim. Despite an avalanche of stories showing that\u2019s not true, a HuffPost poll last year showed 28 percent of Americans, and nearly half of Republicans, believe millions voted illegally in 2016. Thirty-five percent said they were unsure. Republicans in Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina have pushed voting restrictions, citing the need to improve election integrity.\n\nNicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard, said it was easy for people to latch on to voter fraud claims.\n\n\u201cMainstream media coverage of false claims ends up validating and amplifying, even if you say this is false.... You make it familiar and people think familiar things are true,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe brain likes rumors. Broadly speaking, the crazier the rumor, the stickier it is for the brain. And correcting rumors doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d\n\nWhen figures of authority, such as Trump, amplify false claims, they become even harder to debunk, Minnite added.\n\nMcDonald said news organizations faced a kind of Catch-22 in covering allegations of voter fraud. Writing about them, even if an article included evidence to the contrary, only amplified unsubstantiated allegations. On the other hand, he said, ignoring the claims entirely allowed them to go into the public sphere unchallenged.\n\nMcDonald said it was encouraging that news outlets like The Texas Tribune covered the latest allegations of fraud with skepticism from the outset. There hasn\u2019t always been that kind of suspicion from news coverage in the past, and McDonald said the immediate skepticism helps start an important public dialogue about the veracity of the initial claim.\n\nOn Tuesday, as Texas officials were contacting county election administrators to correct the list of suspected noncitizens, a woman across the country stood and spoke in favor of a proposed voter ID bill in the Wyoming Legislature. She pointed to the allegations of fraud in Texas \u2015 which already requires voters to present ID at the polls \u2015 to explain why her state needed voter ID.

In 2018, she lost her authority. Tonight, she lost her Brexit plan. So, what happens next?\n\nWithin seconds of the biggest parliamentary defeat in modern history, a humiliated Theresa May announced she would agree to a vote of confidence in her own government.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn had already beaten her to the punch, tabling his own emergency motion to demand a general election.\n\nThe House of Commons has cleared its timetable for the emergency debate to take place all day on Wednesday, with a vote at 7pm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the start. There are lots of different, inter-locking outcomes. Here\u2019s how the next few days could pan out...\n\nWill we get a general election?\n\nLike any leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn sees a general election as his number one priority.\n\nUnder the Fixed Terms Parliaments Act, if May loses a confidence vote by a simple majority, she has two weeks to try to find enough support to form a viable government.\n\nIf she can\u2019t, Corbyn can then try to find alliances to form his own administration. After 14 calendar days, May would face a second confidence vote and if she loses that, the UK will have another general election.\n\n\n\nThe real problem for Corbyn is that there\u2019s very little chance of the DUP or rebel Tory MPs giving him the majority he needs. The Eurosceptic European Research Group of Brexiteer MPs has already pledged its support.\n\nBut even if the motion fails on Wednesday night, the Labour leader is perfectly free to try again at a point when he feels he can get more success.\n\nHis spokesman pointed to the 1970s when it took six confidence votes to unseat the sitting government: \u201cThere have been situations in the past where there have been no confidence votes which haven\u2019t succeeded on the first occasion.\u201d\n\nThe appetite among Tory MPs to think the unthinkable \u2013 triggering a general election that could damage their party \u2013 may increase if parliament looks like it is heading for a no-deal Brexit on March 29.\n\nTime is running out, however. Under the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, 25 working days are needed for an election campaign. So MPs really have until mid-February to act, if they are to hold polling day before the UK quits the EU.\n\nIn reality, an extension to Article 50 \u2013 the two-year legal timetable for Brexit \u2013 would be needed to allow more time for negotiations with the new government.\n\nCan Brexit be stopped?\n\nThe only way Brexit can realistically be halted is if MPs either back a second EU referendum, or if there is a general election in which Labour campaigns to Remain in the EU, and wins.\n\nSoon after the Leave result in 2016, many dismissed as ridiculous the idea that Britons could be asked to somehow re-run the referendum.\n\nBut backers of a so-called \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019 have stepped up a highly successful campaign since last summer, claiming that the public have a right to endorse or reject the kind of Brexit the government has finally drafted.\n\nThe campaign got its biggest ever boost when Labour adopted a new policy last September. \u201cIf we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote,\u201d the policy stated.\n\nYet Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest aides stress that a public vote is just one option and not the default or preferred option.\n\nSome Labour MPs suspect Corbyn will do everything possible to avoid holding a new referendum, partly because of worries about Leave voters in Labour\u2019s marginal and heartland seats. Others, like shadow chancellor John McDonnell, seem to be holding open the option more strongly.\n\nThe real problem is one of numbers. Although a sprinkling of Tory MPs (and even ministers privately) back the idea, there are so far not enough MPs overall to give a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019 amendment a majority.\n\nEven if MPs opted to back one, legal requirements on impartiality mean it could take at least a year to hold a new referendum. Again, Article 50 would need to be extended. And to actually win, any Remain referendum campaign would have to enthuse voters in a way it failed in 2016.\n\nCuriously, seconds after the government\u2019s defeat was announced, European Council President Donald Tusk took to Twitter to suggest the UK should stay in the EU, arguing the prime minister\u2019s historic loss in parliament left a deal looking \u201cimpossible\u201d. He kept open the idea of Brexit being reversed.\n\nWill May try again?\n\nThe scale of the defeat \u2013 truly catastrophic rather than merely awful as some whips had hoped \u2013 makes it very difficult to see how May can win over rebels by merely tweaking her defeated deal.\n\nSome 118 Tory MPs voted against her plan - almost exactly the same number of MPs who voted to oust her as party leader (117) last month.\n\nThat suggests she may have to rely on Labour MPs to get any deal through Parliament.\n\nCrucially, she said May would hold meetings with \u201csenior Parliamentarians from across the House\u201d to identify \u201cwhat would be required to secure the backing of the House\u201d. These secret talks will start from Thursday.\n\nUnder the EU Withdrawal Bill, May is legally required to come up with a full statement within three days. No.10 said it \u201cexpects\u201d her to make that statement on Monday and table a new Brexit motion at the same time.\n\nShe then has some breathing space of up to seven \u2018sitting days\u2019 of the Commons (January 30), before MPs vote again on any new deal. Sources suggest the fresh vote would take place later next week.\n\nMay desperately needs something new to persuade both Tory and DUP MPs that the UK won\u2019t be locked indefinitely into the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, the link to EU trade regulations aimed at keeping the border with Ireland open.\n\nThat \u201csomething\u201d may be a new UK-EU joint legislative document that clarifies in law that Britain will not be tied to Brussels rules without end. The EU has made clear it won\u2019t renegotiate the withdrawal agreement for Brexit, but it might grant this concession to avoid a no-deal.\n\nHowever, with a massive number of her own MPs against her, May\u2019s \u2018Plan B\u2019 can\u2019t really be \u2018Plan A-plus\u2019. She has a nightmare balancing act now: offer Labour MPs too much and she risks further bleeding Tory support; offer Tory MPs too much and the EU will never accept it.\n\nShe\u2019s a zombie PM in a zombie Parliament, and may get only one more time to resurrect her deal from the dead.\n\nWill MPs back a softer Brexit?\n\nA so-called \u2018Norway-style\u2019 Brexit is being pushed by some Labour and Tory backbenchers. It aims to keep the UK in the EU single market, ensuring free trade to continue on services, which makes up 80% of the UK economy.\n\nThe plan also aims to achieve a customs union with the EU, a key element that would remove the problem of the Northern Irish border.\n\nFor some MPs there are major downsides, not least that the single market would mean no new curbs on EU migration, something many Leave voters have demanded. A customs union would also mean the UK couldn\u2019t strike its own free trade deals independently of Brussels.\n\nBoth of these are \u2018red lines\u2019 for the PM and many Tory MPs who think it would mean \u2018Brexit in name only\u2019 (also known as \u2018Brino\u2019). But if May\u2019s own deal is rejected repeatedly she may have no choice.\n\nStraight after the defeat, a No.10 spokesman said May\u2019s talks with MPs would take place on the \u2018basis\u2019 of her current deal, with the \u2018principles\u2019 being that the UK took control of its \u2018money, borders and laws\u2019 and retained an \u2018independent trade policy\u2019.\n\nEach of those \u2018red line\u2019 principles may have to be erased. An independent trade policy is impossible if May supports a customs union. Control of borders is very difficult if she backs a single market.\n\nA \u2018Norway-style\u2019 Brexit would need more negotiation with Brussels and probably therefore an extension to Article 50. Some argue, however, that because the plan makes the Northern Ireland backstop irrelevant, May\u2019s withdrawal agreement could pass and the \u2018political declaration\u2019 tweaked instead.\n\nThe main attraction of \u2018Norway Plus\u2019 for Labour MPs, possibly including Jeremy Corbyn, is that it is consistent with his pledge at the last election to uphold the 2016 referendum result. Tories would have to swallow a lot, however, to accept it.\n\nWill the Commons get to choose which \u2018Plan B\u2019 it wants?\n\nThe real action on Brexit talks between May and other parties starts next week. MPs held off proposing their alternatives today because they wanted a clear signal that May\u2019s deal was dead first.\n\nIt is now up to them to work out which \u2018Plan B\u2019 can get a majority, with detailed amendments to the government\u2019s next motion. But tactics will come into play too.\n\nSupporters of the rival plans for a \u2018Norway-style\u2019 Brexit and a second referendum want their solution to be the last one standing after all the other options have failed.\n\nOn this, as on many other matters of procedure, the Speaker of the Commons suddenly assumes even more importance than usual.\n\nThanks to a hung parliament tying the government\u2019s hands and to his own decision to tear up previous conventions, John Bercow is now a very important figure. He may, for example, refuse to allow May to keep bringing back her deal several times.\n\nThere is one other option: the PM could proactively agree to demands from some of her Cabinet ministers to hold a series of \u2018indicative\u2019 votes on each of the options. But No.10 sources suggest that\u2019s unlikely.\n\nAre we heading for a no-deal Brexit?\n\nUnder the EU Withdrawal Act 2018, the default position is that the UK will leave the EU on March 29, 2019 \u2013 with or without any agreement.\n\nMany Tory Brexiteers have hoped that they can thus \u201crun down the clock\u201d while the Commons squabbles over Brexit, and just wait for exit day to arrive.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s language has changed dramatically on this in the past two years. In January 2017, she uttered the infamous line that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Having lost the last election, she\u2019s been forced to now effectively threaten Tory MPs that \u201cmy bad deal is better than no Brexit at all\u201d.\n\nSome Cabinet ministers say that May has also changed tack after reading detailed forecasts from civil servants setting out the full \u201cdisaster\u201d for trade, and, crucially, security policy if we quit without a deal.\n\nLabour has long argued no-deal is a negotiating \u201cbluff\u201d, and despite billions being spent on emergency contingency plans, it looks very much like a bluff now.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-trump-el-paso_us_5c620e38e4b028d543172ca8": "EL PASO, Texas \u2015 Thousands are expected to turn out Monday night to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall and his insistence that this overwhelmingly Democratic city is the best place to make the case for it.\n\nThe protests set up a clash between Trump and a potential opponent in 2020: Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, a born-and-raised El Pasoan who is speaking at the protest set up as counter-programming to the president\u2019s Monday evening rally in the city.\n\nO\u2019Rourke insisted Monday that his appearance at the protest wasn\u2019t a personal challenge to Trump and instead was meant to be in support of the more than 50 community groups that organized the march.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s here in an effort to use this community as a prop to make his case for the border wall,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told reporters on a call.\n\nThe competing protest clearly got the president\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWe have a line that is very long already,\u201d Trump said before leaving Washington for El Paso. \u201cI mean, you see what\u2019s going on.

His ability to get new voters to the polls and out-fundraise his opponent without accepting PAC money stoked enthusiasm for a presidential run even before the U.S. Senate race ended. He recently said he would make a decision on a presidential bid later this month.\n\nBut, save a few public appearances, he remained largely out of the spotlight until Trump cast his sights on El Paso.\n\nTrump cited El Paso in his State of the Union speech last week as evidence of the need for border wall funding, inaccurately claiming that the city was among the country\u2019s most violent until the federal government began fencing it off from its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. (In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nTrump is expected to make further exaggerations on Monday evening in hopes of winning support for $5.7 billion to begin building a border wall.

Eyeing the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, the CEO of one giant bank recently told Politico that the party\u2019s nominee \u201ccan\u2019t be Warren and it can\u2019t be Sanders.\u201d To plutocrat Michael Bloomberg, Sanders is a \u201cdemagogue\u201d preaching \u201cunreason,\u201d while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will transform the United States into a \u201cnon-capitalistic\u201d system where \u201cpeople are starving to death,\u201d like \u201cVenezuela.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric from the 0.01 percent is more than a little overheated. But for most people, Warren and Sanders hail from the same left flank of the Democratic Party \u2015 both are supporters of enacting Medicare for all, breaking up the banks and dramatically increasing taxes on the very wealthy.\n\nAnd yet in liberal and left-wing political discourse, the idea that Sanders and Warren are philosophical companions has become unfashionable. Jacobin, The New Republic, Splinter, BuzzFeed, The Week and The Guardian have all emphasized the supposedly critical ideological distinction between the two candidates: Sanders is an avowed socialist, while Warren wants to reform capitalism.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the next president takes office, they will likely face intense pressure from powerful interests, especially big business,\u201d writes Zaid Jilani. \u201cThe choice between Warren and Sanders may very well determine if that president confronts those interests with careful reasoning and principled advocacy or the force of a mass movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two senators disagree over the best method to give the working classes a leg up,\u201d according to David Dayen. \u201cYou can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option.\u201d For Jacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara, Warren aims at \u201cseeking to construct better policy but not an alternative politics,\u201d rejecting \u201cthe class-struggle, worker-centric approach of Sanders.\u201d\n\nFor once, the big-brain intellectuals have it wrong, and the delusional, selfish plutocrats are right. Whatever Warren and Sanders say to establish their political brands, the two senators do in fact represent a very similar way of thinking about politics. That\u2019s why billionaires hate them both.\n\nIt\u2019s true: You won\u2019t find any videos of Warren singing \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d with a bunch of shirtless Soviets in the 1980s. And Sanders never slogged through troves of household bankruptcy data looking for the most common sources of middle-class financial strain. There are real differences between the two candidates (technically Bernie hasn\u2019t announced yet). But these are differences of temperament, style and strategy. Sanders and Warren, in fact, see the world in very similar ways.\n\nThe trouble for leftish intellectuals is a confusion over the terms \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201ccapitalism.\u201d Both words are extremely flexible, and their meanings shift with political currents. In an American context, it has never been easy to distinguish between socialism and reformed capitalism \u2015 and committed capitalists have denounced both with vigor. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was condemned as a socialist by congressional Republicans. In the 1940s, American conservatives viewed the social safety net in Britain and the Stalinist Soviet Union with almost equal alarm. By the 1950s, Herbert Hoover had concluded that the words \u201cliberalism\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d really just meant the same thing.\n\nSo, yes, Bernie Sanders has long been a champion of labor movements, protest marches and democratic socialism, while Elizabeth Warren is an academic wonk who talks about restoring competition to markets and making capitalism more accountable. But when it comes to their most detailed policies to date, both support an array of trust-busting, tougher regulation, wealth redistribution, public options and, where appropriate, nationalization.\n\nIt depends on the problem they\u2019re trying to solve. In practice, they end up supporting an awful lot of the same solutions. In addition to Medicare for all, breaking up the banks and taxing the rich, both Warren and Sanders are advocates of a federal job guarantee, postal banking and a bill making it easier for workers to unionize.\n\nAll of these proposals transfer money and power from the super-rich to the not-rich. Take postal banking. About 32.6 million households rely on a check-cashing service, payday lender or other expensive, small-dollar financial bottom-feeder at least once a year, according to the FDIC. On average, these households earn about $25,500 a year and spend nearly 10 percent of their income \u2015 $2,412 \u2015 on these sketchy financial products. That\u2019s over $82 billion going from hard-up homes to predators every year. You can deal with payday lenders a lot of different ways: ban them, regulate them or, the preferred tack of Warren and Sanders, have the government make them obsolete. If every household can get a low-fee bank account with the Post Office, they won\u2019t have to turn to legalized loan sharking to get by. That\u2019s bad news for payday loan executives, like ACE Cash Express CEO Jay Shipowitz, who made almost $4.5 million in 2004 alone. Is postal banking socialism or reformed capitalism? Yes.\n\nIn America today, the super-rich not only control an outrageous share of the national wealth, they also exercise a degree of political power incompatible with basic democratic principles. The choice for Democrats in 2020 is not really about policy minutia \u2015 it\u2019s about power \u2015 who has it, and who doesn\u2019t. And both Sanders and Warren have proved they are willing to confront the powerful and attack their sources of power. We can call this socialism, New Deal liberalism or Jeffersonian democracy \u2015 whatever the label, it\u2019s a critical ideological test for anyone who wants to be the next president of the United States.\n\nRunning for re-election in 1936, FDR noted that the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d of \u201cbusiness and financial monopoly, speculation\u201d and \u201creckless banking\u201d all counted themselves among his political \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me \u2015 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-voter-fraud-allegations_us_5c4f8708e4b00906b26c62ac": "When Lisa Wise, the top election official in El Paso County, Texas, got a list of suspected noncitizens on her voter rolls, one name quickly stood out. It was the name of someone in her office who went to get a state ID a few years ago and recently became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n\nThe data point underscores why many are skeptical about claims from Texas\u2019 Secretary of State David Whitley (R) and Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) that 95,000 noncitizens may be on the voting rolls and that 58,000 of them voted in at least one election since 1996. Election officials, lawyers and experts said that number is likely inflated because of people who applied for driver\u2019s licenses when they were legal permanent residents and later became naturalized.\n\nWhitley\u2019s office told county officials on Friday to investigate further, but Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) quickly seized on the numbers and claimed there was voter fraud in the state. On Sunday, President Donald Trump amplified the claims.\n\nSophia Lin Lakin, a staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project, said she suspected the quick claims of voter fraud were part of an effort to justify voting restrictions. Critics say requiring documentary proof of voting eligibility is unnecessary and is more likely to affect young people, who move around a lot, as well as the poor and minority voters who don\u2019t have access to the required documentation or the resources to get them to obtain them and take them to election officials. A bill to require people to prove their citizenship was filed in the Texas House of Representatives in November.\n\nWise said her office received about 4,100 names to investigate from the Secretary of State\u2019s Office on Sunday evening. She said the Department of Public Safety (DPS), which maintains driver\u2019s license records, might have outdated records.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to the DPS and you mark noncitizen, if you go through the naturalization ceremonies where we\u2019re at and we\u2019re promoting voter registration, which we did about 200 a year, you\u2019re not going back to DPS after that.

Officials were going to carefully review all the names on the list before taking further action, he said.\n\nTwelve civil rights groups jointly wrote to Whitley on Monday urging him to rescind the advisory he sent Friday to counties on the suspected noncitizens on the rolls, saying his methodology was unreliable.\n\nI would be surprised, bordering on stunned, if that many slipped through their process.\u201d Bruce Elfant, Travis County tax assessor-collector and voter registrar\n\nCharles Stewart, the director of the MIT election lab and an expert on election administration, estimated that up to 1 million adults have become naturalized in Texas since 1996. He said he studied similar cases in which suspected noncitizens on the voting rolls turned out to be naturalized citizens.\n\nIn 2012, Florida election officials ran a similar program that compared driver\u2019s license records against the state\u2019s voter registration database and flagged more than 180,000 possible noncitizens for removal from the state\u2019s voter rolls. Officials then revised the list to 2,600 people, and 85 people were ultimately removed from the rolls. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled in 2014 that the state\u2019s process for removing people from the rolls ran afoul of federal law.\n\nIn its ruling, the 11th Circuit said there was a \u201crealistic probability\u201d two naturalized citizens who were plaintiffs in the case would be incorrectly identified as ineligible voters through the state\u2019s data-matching process.\n\nKathy Culliton-Gonz\u00e1lez, an attorney who represented the plaintiffs, said it is widely known that driver\u2019s license databases do not produce reliable indicators of voter eligibility and could unfairly target naturalized people.\n\n\u201cThey can be very intimidating.

Attorneys for Harris filed suit in state court earlier this month saying the state board was required to certify Harris the winner because votes had been tabulated correctly and no voters had filed a protest. They asked a judge to force the state board to certify Harris the winner.\n\nWake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway denied that request on Tuesday, saying that the state board had the legal authority to deny certification to Harris while it investigated irregularities. When the state board began probing the election in late November, it amounted to a legal protest of the election, Ridgeway ruled. State law requires the board to issue certification five days after a protest is dismissed or denied.\n\n\u201cNothing about today\u2019s court hearing changes the fact that @MarkHarrisNC9 won the election, has more legal votes, and no public evidence has put the outcome in doubt.

McCrae Dowless, an operative working on Harris\u2019 behalf, is accused of paying people to collect completed absentee ballots from voters \u2015 something that violates North Carolina law. Both Harris and Dowless have denied wrongdoing.\n\nDemocrats, who took control of the U.S. House in January, have also indicated they would not seat Harris until the state board\u2019s investigation was complete. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chair of the Committee on House Administration, which would oversee an investigation, sent a letter to the state board earlier in January asking it to preserve all evidence in its investigation. Currently voters in North Carolina\u2019s 9th congressional district do not have a representative in the U.S. House.\n\nComplicating the investigation is the status of the state board of elections. In October, a 3-judge panel struck down the state board, saying changes legislative Republicans made to the board were unconstitutional. The judges allowed the panel to remain in existence through the November 2018 elections, and then continued its existence as the probe into the Harris-McCready race began. But when the investigation took longer than expected, the panel dissolved the state board in December. Republicans refused to submit names for an interim board, leaving the body vacant until a new one is appointed on Jan. 31.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to providing a full accounting of what transpired once a Board is seated,\u201d Kim Westbrook Strach, the current executive director of the state board, said in a statement. \u201cPublic confidence in our elections system demands it.\u201d\n\nRidgeway dismissed arguments from Harris\u2019 attorneys on Tuesday that the dissolution of the board ended the probe and that Harris should be certified the winner. Ridgeway ruled that the investigation was ongoing and the new board would be able to take it up once it is seated.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that Harris\u2019 frivolous request has been denied and that North Carolina can get back to investigating allegations of systematic electoral fraud committed on behalf of Harris\u2019 campaign.

About 58,000 of them had cast a ballot over the last two decades. Those numbers came from an investigation that began a year ago, according to a news release. By Sunday, President Donald Trump had given the allegations of rampant voter fraud a massive megaphone, calling it \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be stopped!\u201d the president said on Twitter.\n\nThe Texas secretary of state\u2019s office declined multiple requests for comment. But Whitley\u2019s allegations crumble under minimal scrutiny.\n\nThe list culled by the secretary of state resulted from cross-checks with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues drivers licenses and public identification cards. But because DPS is a state agency, it doesn\u2019t keep reliable citizenship records \u2015 it only asks for proof of citizenship when people apply for state IDs. If someone becomes naturalized after obtaining a driver\u2019s license, which happens frequently, that new citizen isn\u2019t required to check back in to let the state know of the change. An estimated 1 million foreign-born Texans have been naturalized since 1996, and a majority of the state\u2019s immigrant population was born in Latin America.\n\nThe lack of evidence behind allegations that Attorney General Ken Paxton branded with the words \u201cVOTER FRAUD ALERT\u201d in a tweet has drawn condemnation from legal and advocacy groups.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office upped the number of suspect noncitizen voters to 98,000 on Monday. There were immediate signs that the lists were flawed. Lisa Wise, the top election official in El Paso County, told HuffPost that a naturalized co-worker was on the list. By Tuesday, the secretary of state\u2019s office had begun calling counties to alert them to mistakes on the lists it sent out, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nThe timing of the crackdown has also fueled concern about ulterior political motivations.\n\nFor more than two decades, Republicans have held firm control over Texas government, often winning statewide races by margins of 20 percentage points or more. That accomplishment is notable in a majority-minority state, where voters of color skew Democratic. The main reason why Texas demographics haven\u2019t ruptured GOP control is that the state\u2019s voter turnout is among the lowest in the nation, with Latinos in particular turning out at rates far below Anglos, who skew Republican.\n\nNovember\u2019s midterm elections upended that dynamic.\n\nA surge in turnout across the state narrowed Republican Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s margin of victory to just 2.7 percentage points. Justin Nelson, with little funding and less press, came within 3.6 points of ousting Republican Ken Paxton as the state\u2019s attorney general. Democrats picked up a dozen seats in the Texas House, and several of the most conservative politicians either lost or saw their margins of victory dwindle.\n\n\u201cTexas is trending certainly in a purple direction,\u201d Nelson, the Austin lawyer who attempted to unseat Paxton, told HuffPost. \u201cInstead of working to appeal to all Texans, the strategy is to try to intimidate and purge.\u201d\n\nSeveral factors account for the spike in turnout across the board \u2015 controversy over Trump, long-term efforts by nonprofits to boost Latino turnout and an underdog campaign by former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke to unseat Cruz.\n\nThe precise role that Latino turnout played in those results won\u2019t be clear until the U.S. census\u2019 American Community Survey is released, which normally comes out in the spring. But turnout more than doubled compared with the last midterm election in several border counties, where the population is overwhelmingly Latino and largely votes Democratic.\n\nTurnout in Texas was driven by majority-Latino counties in 2018 pic.twitter.com/ueLBzFYEz5 \u2014 Latino Decisions (@LatinoDecisions) November 15, 2018\n\n\u201cWe should be very cautious with accepting this information from the state, especially after a surge in Latino voter turnout,\u201d Cristina Tzintz\u00fan, director of Jolt, a Latino youth voter mobilization group, told HuffPost. \u201cThere should be a thorough investigation about why this data came out now, how it was produced, if it was accurately produced and why it came out so close to an election when we had such high Latino turnout.\u201d\n\nTexas demographics make it all but certain that the list contains mostly Hispanic names. Several Spanish surnames are very common, and state authorities often incorrectly enter compound last names into databases, which critics say increases the likelihood of falsely matching a U.S. citizen\u2019s name to a noncitizen\u2019s.\n\nTexas Republicans have been on a mission for over a decade to cast more scrutiny on voter registrations. In 2011, the state passed a sweeping voter ID law that required people to present photo identification before casting a ballot. A federal judge later curbed the law\u2019s implementation, but Texas still requires voters to either present one of several forms of photo ID or a document proving that obtaining one imposed an unnecessary burden.\n\nWe should be very cautious with accepting this information from the state, especially after a surge in Latino voter turnout. Cristina Tzintz\u00fan, director of Jolt\n\nThe efforts to impose stricter vetting of registered voters are still alive in the Texas Legislature and reflect the secretary of state\u2019s logic. State Rep. Mike Lang (R-Granbury) filed a bill in November that would set into law the flawed process of cross-checking registrations with DPS and give voters 60 days to prove their citizenship after receiving a letter from the secretary of state\u2019s office or be dropped from rolls.\n\nIf the bill were to pass in its current form, it would violate the National Voter Registration Act, according to Nina Perales, the vice president of litigation for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\n\u201cOur bill seeks to codify basically what they\u2019re seeking to do internally,\u201d Lang\u2019s chief of staff, Zach Maxwell, told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019re still pushing it.\u201d\n\nMaxwell acknowledged that the secretary of state\u2019s list does not prove any wrongdoing and that cross-checks with DPS would lead to false positives, likely placing additional burdens on naturalized citizens. Lang is open to revising that provision of the bill, he said.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are potential situations where there could be false positives, but at the same time we do know that there is a hole in the system,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be as fair as possible. We have due process in this country. You are innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nBut Friday\u2019s announcement takes the battle over voter registration requirements out of the Legislature and puts it in the hands of state agencies, where Democratic lawmakers have less ability to debate them.\n\nTexas Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda (D-Dallas) has examined the issue of voter fraud in the past and concluded that it does occur but that cases are isolated and rare.

Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) quickly seized on the number as evidence of voter fraud in the state. But by Tuesday, the state was contacting officials and letting them know there were errors in the data.

In one county, every single person on the list was actually a citizen. More than a dozen civil rights groups are protesting the advisory, saying it amounts to an effort to intimidate minorities and naturalized citizens from voting. The timing is also suspect, given a surge in Latino voter turnout in the 2018 election.\n\nCheryl Johnson, the Galveston County tax assessor and the county\u2019s election administrator, said her office had heard back from several residents who received a notice and that none seemed to be upset.\n\nBut Beth Stevens, director of the Voting Rights Program at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said some legitimate voters wouldn\u2019t respond to the request for proof of citizenship for a wide range of reasons.\n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t know that this notice is all that important, so they may not even read it. Two, someone who is a properly registered voter might not have those three pieces of documentation just on them,\u201d she said.

She said her office wouldn\u2019t send any more notices until it got responses from the people it had already mailed notices to and verified how many of them were citizens. If a high percentage were proved to be citizens, she said, she would ask the secretary of state\u2019s office to check its data.\n\nStevens disputed that Johnson was required to send out the notices. She said the original advisory from the secretary of state\u2019s office made it clear counties could choose to investigate but could also take no action if they believed the voter was eligible.

Stevens said about 50,000 Texans became naturalized citizens each year and it was \u201chighly suspect\u201d that the memo took that into account.\n\n\u201cThere is no credible data that indicates illegal voting is happening in any significant numbers, and the secretary\u2019s statement does not change that fact,\u201d she said.\n\nStevens expressed concerns that the memo could \u201cresult in tens of thousands of eligible voters being removed from the rolls, including those with the least resources to comply with the demand to show papers.\u201d\n\nKeith Ingram, the state\u2019s director of elections, wrote in the memo that the information on the number of non-citizens on voting rolls should be treated as \u201cWEAK\u201d matches, meaning county officials need to further investigate the cases. Ingram also said counties could not cancel any of the suspected non-citizen voter registrations without first mailing them a notice giving them 30 days to prove their citizenship.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump has repeatedly made misleading and inaccurate statements about voter fraud.\n\nAmong the 95,000 registered voters who may be non-citizens, the number state officials said actually cast ballots in at least one election \u2014 58,000 \u2014 also lacks context. The Texas Tribune reported the number covers elections from 1996-2018, a 22-year time span Paxton did not mention in his statement.\n\nThere are nearly 15.8 million registered voters in Texas, over 8.3 million of whom voted in the 2018 general election.\n\nLast year, Paxton created a unit in his office focused on targeting election crimes. So far, the unit has prosecuted 33 people. Among them is Rosa Maria Ortega, a legal permanent resident who was sentenced to 8 years in prison for illegally voting. Ortega, who faces likely deportation, said she made a mistake and had no idea she was ineligible to vote.\n\n\u201cIt is also no surprise that the attorney general tweeted about this announcement using alarmist language that is clearly intended to advance a false political narrative to further restrict access to the ballot box,\u201d Stevens said in her statement.\n\nThe Texas Tribune, as always, doing the work we need. Did 58,000 non-citizens vote in Texas?\n\n\n\nShort answer: No. https://t.co/IOFPXYDj7H \u2014 Stuart Spooner (@StuartSpooner) January 27, 2019\n\nSeveral studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem across the nation. But since winning the presidency, Trump has made a number of unsubstantiated claims that have attempted to paint a different picture.\n\nHe has claimed that between 3 and 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election \u2015 while offering no evidence to support that claim. He has argued he would have won New Hampshire in the 2016 election had it not been for people bused in from out of state to vote \u2015 a claim debunked by state officials. He also has suggested there was widespread illegal voting in California \u2015 and again, there is no evidence that\u2019s true.\n\nShortly after he took office in early 2017, he convened a panel to investigate voter fraud. But it was marred by infighting and disbanded after a few months without finding any evidence of widespread fraud.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-for-the-people-act-hr-1_us_5c379e73e4b045f6768a2e7a": "A sweeping reform bill that House Democrats say will be their first priority after ending the partial government shutdown is filled with policies that would fundamentally alter the nation\u2019s voting and campaign finance systems. These policies are not coming out of nowhere. Most of them have been implemented and tested in cities and states across the country.\n\n\u201cWithin the last five or six years, you just got more and more of these solutions happening at the state and local level,\u201d said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the bill\u2019s chief sponsor. \u201cIt\u2019s not a unicorn. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about something that exists in the atmosphere of Jupiter. This is happening in America.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, in a famous dissenting opinion from 1932, asserted the freedom of a state or local government to \u201cserve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\u201d This \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d concept holds that state and local governments are the proper place to test policies before they move to the national stage.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in Democrats\u2019 H.R. 1, which they\u2019re calling the For the People Act. The bill\u2019s campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. The same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.\n\nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks alongside Democratic lawmakers about H.R. 1, the \"For the People Act,\" at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 4.\n\nAutomatic Voter Registration\n\nSince 2015, 15 states and the District of Columbia have adopted automatic voter registration, a popular reform among advocates who believe it can significantly expand the number of people on the voting rolls in the United States.\n\nThe policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: When someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. If they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. Federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.\n\nOregon, considered the model for automatic voter registration, was the first state in the country to pass it in 2015. While it\u2019s still relatively early to assess the impact, the early evidence is encouraging. The policy went into effect in January 2016 and in a little over a year and a half, the policy added 375,000 people to the voter rolls. A 2017 analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found over 116,000 people had been added to the rolls who wouldn\u2019t have otherwise registered.\n\nAutomatic voter registration also went into effect in California last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in April and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (There were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of October.) The program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the DMV made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. The head of the DMV resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.\n\nAutomatic Restoration Of Voting Rights For People With Felony Convictions\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former felons Desmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, left, and David Ayala, husband of State Attorney Aramis Ayala, celebrate with copies of their voter registration forms after voters approved an initiative restoring voting rights to ex-felons in November.\n\nForty-eight states don\u2019t allow people with felony convictions to vote while they are incarcerated, but states have widely different policies on when and how ex-felons can get back their right to vote. Some states allow former felons to vote once they\u2019re released from prison, while others bar them while they\u2019re on probation or parole. The various policies can be extremely confusing and deter people from registering to vote, even if they\u2019re eligible.\n\nThe For the People Act aims to fix this problem by automatically restoring voting rights once someone is released from prison. Currently, 13 states and the District of Columbia do this, but having a federal statute would help make the process easier for everyone involved.\n\n\u201cI think having a uniform rule that applies to everyone, everywhere and making that loud and having some action on it would be really helpful,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, a New York-based nonprofit advocating for campaign finance reform and voting rights. \u201cHaving a uniform policy would clear up confusion among voters. It would also clear up confusion among elections officials. It would make keeping track of voter lists a lot easier.\u201d\n\nDark Money Disclosure\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision led to an explosion of undisclosed money spent by nonprofits, trade associations and corporate entities in elections. Congress attempted to fix the court\u2019s collateral damage to transparency with the Disclose Act in 2010, but it fell one vote short of clearing a Republican filibuster in the Senate.\n\nStates have since stepped in to pass their own Disclose Acts or to issue regulations to stop dark money in state elections. Varying disclosure rules to plug the holes created by the Supreme Court have been adopted in California, Delaware, Montana, New York, Texas, Vermont and Washington. Some of these laws provide more disclosure than others, and that can help Congress determine the best option for federal elections.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s Disclose Act is great but limited,\u201d said former Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit MapLight.\n\nThe California government has enacted two disclosure bills since the Citizens United decision. The first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. The second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. Ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower \u2015 which is something the House Democrats\u2019 bill does.\n\nDemocracy Vouchers\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Seattle City Council member Teresa Mosqueda was the first person in the country to win an elected office by collecting \"democracy vouchers\" to fund her campaign.\n\nA little-noticed provision in Democrats\u2019 big reform bill would create a pilot program for \u201cdemocracy vouchers\u201d \u2015 a proposal to provide every citizen with vouchers that can be used as small-dollar political donations. These vouchers would come in $25 increments, but could be used to give donations as low as $1.\n\nThe \u201cdemocracy vouchers\u201d idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor Bruce Ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until Seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. The program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. One study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the city\u2019s 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.\n\nThe vouchers also provide an alternative fundraising system for candidates who lack the kind of connections to big-money donors that are often seen as necessary to run for office.\n\nIn 2017, Seattle City Council candidate Teresa Mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. She had kept hearing that she should run for City Council from participants in a program she ran for the AFL-CIO that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. She was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a Latina in the labor movement who didn\u2019t come from money. But her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign \u2015 until Seattle\u2019s democracy vouchers became available.\n\n\u201cThe democracy vouchers program really took the pressure away from having to see yourself bankrolling a campaign or frankly having to dial for dollars for the majority of your time,\u201d Mosqueda said.\n\n\u201cI was able to spend more time talking with people about what they wanted to see in government,\u201d she added.\n\nThe pilot program in the Democrats\u2019 bill would be implemented in three randomly selected states to test how it works for congressional elections and whether it should be expanded to the whole country.\n\nEarly Voting And Same-Day Registration\n\nThe For the People Act would require states to allow people to register on the same day they vote and to allow voters to cast ballots for at least 15 consecutive days before Election Day. It would require poll sites to be open at least four hours each of those days and, to the greatest extent possible, that they be located near public transportation.\n\nTwenty states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. It\u2019s seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. Federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. Activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.\n\nEarly voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between Republicans and Democrats over voting laws. The conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits Democrats, so Republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. But one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. The authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while Election Day registration tends to benefit Democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe type of voter who takes advantage of early voting \u2015 older, whiter, and wealthier \u2015 is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote Republican,\u201d the authors wrote in a blog post last year. \u201cOur findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on Democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. The availability of early voting in isolation raises the Republican vote by about six percentage points.\u201d\n\nWhen same-day registration is combined with early voting, the paper found, voter turnout aligns more with the conventional wisdom.\n\nIndependent Redistricting Commissions\n\nH.R. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. State lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. In 2011, Republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. They executed that plan extremely precisely and well.\n\nSix states \u2015 Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana and Washington \u2015 use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (Voters in Michigan, Utah and Colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the November election.) Advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair.\n\nWhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters. Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at Common Cause\n\nIn 2011, California\u2019s independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. Anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission \u2015 which is made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people not affiliated with either party \u2015 but there are strict requirements on who can serve. Eligible applicants must be registered to vote in California and have voted in two of the last three elections. In the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also can\u2019t have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. Votes from multiple Democrats, Republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. H.R. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair.\n\n\u201cWhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they don\u2019t have to face serious competition for the next 10 years,\u201d said Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at the good government group Common Cause, which championed the creation of California\u2019s commission.\n\nSmall-Donor Public Financing\n\nThe For the People Act\u2019s main campaign finance reform is the creation of a small-donor matching system to publicly finance congressional elections. It is based on the decades-old public financing program run for New York City elections.\n\nNew York adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. At the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. A candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. But the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.\n\nProponents of New York City\u2019s matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. Currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. That means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. Democrats\u2019 For the People Act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the New York City system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s been around for 30 years and it\u2019s still working, I think that\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Lawrence Norden, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nNew York City\u2019s system has enabled candidates \u2015 especially those from less affluent neighborhoods \u2015 to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. \u201cThe city\u2019s public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns,\u201d a 2012 study by the Brennan Center and the progressive think tank Demos found.\n\nThis small-donor matching system has also spread to other states, cities and municipalities. Some matching funds programs have existed for years, but in the past five years, adoption has spread rapidly to Washington, D.C.; Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland; and Suffolk County, New York, among other places. New York state lawmakers are currently debating the statewide adoption of such a program.\n\n\u201cIf New York City is any guide, it actually changes how candidates raise money,\u201d Norden said. \u201cSo, right now you have many candidates raising many more contributions than we\u2019ve seen in the past raising from small donors. I think we would see even more of a change of going to constituents and small donors as a source of funding rather than the biggest donors.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-voting-reform_us_5c38e7ede4b0922a21d4bb23": "New York lawmakers say they plan to pass a number of voting reforms on Monday, a move that would bring long-sought change to a state where advocates say election rules are antiquated and the state\u2019s elections are dysfunctional.\n\nVoter turnout in New York elections is consistently low, and Democrats pledged to move quickly to change the state\u2019s election laws after they gained a majority in the state Senate in November, giving them control of both chambers of the legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nOne of the expected bills would establish an early voting period before any election (New York is one of just 12 states that do not have early voting). The early voting period would begin 10 days prior to an election and end two days before it, and would have to include at least two full weekends. The bill would require local election boards to establish one early voting site for every 50,000 voters in their jurisdiction, up to seven sites \u2015 though they could vote to authorize more. The measure would take effect for the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity, now that we have a Democratic majority, to include more people in the democratic process. One of those ways, a commonsense way, is to give people more time to vote,\u201d said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie (D), the chair of the Senate\u2019s elections committee and the sponsor of the early voting bill. \u201cAnyone that finds themselves as an opponent of having more people vote and more people involved in the democratic process should really question why they are opposing. This is not a Democratic increase, this is not a Republican increase. This is a voter increase in participation.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, New York was the only state to have separate primary contests for state and federal elections, something advocates said was duplicative, a waste of money and responsible for lowering voter turnout. A separate bill Democrats plan to pass Monday would consolidate the state and federal primaries to a single date. Officials say the money saved could help pay for the cost of establishing early voting, which is estimated to cost $10 million.\n\nAnother measure would permit 16- and 17-year-olds to \u201cpre-register\u201d to vote (which 13 states and the District of Columbia already allow). New Yorkers have to update their voter registration when they move to a different county, but another bill Democrats plan to pass would require the state to automatically update someone\u2019s voter registration when they receive information the person has moved.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS New York state Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins and fellow Democrats say they will pass election reform Monday.\n\nDemocrats also plan to pass a measure to bring campaign contribution limits for limited liability companies in line with limits for corporations, and to require more transparency \u2015 tightening up, but not completely closing, a loophole that allows donors to evade contribution limits.\n\n\u201cAfter 3 decades of election reformers seemingly banging our heads against a brick wall of Albany obstruction, it\u2019s incredible to see this package of election bills advance,\u201d said Neal Rosenstein, government reform coordinator at the New York Public Interest Research Group, which supports the new laws. \u201cNone of these bills should be at all controversial and have equivalents in place across the country.\u201d\n\nRich Azzopardi, a spokesman for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), said the governor supports and intends to sign the measures. He pointed to a December speech in which Cuomo called on the state to pass election reforms, including the ones Democrats plan to push Monday.\n\n\u201cDid you listen to the FDR speech two weeks ago? Then you know that every one of those items are part of his 100-day agenda,\u201d Azzopardi said. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited the legislature is going to pass these very important reforms that are part of the governor\u2019s 100-day agenda, and we look forward to working with them to do more to pass public campaign financing, to make Election Day a holiday and to ban corporate contributions once and for all.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for state Sen. John Flanagan, the Republican leader in the state Senate, did not respond to a request for comment on the bills. Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for the state Republican Party, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter 3 decades of election reformers seemingly banging our heads against a brick wall of Albany obstruction, it\u2019s incredible to see this package of election bills advance. Neal Rosenstein, NYPRIG government reform coordinator\n\nDemocrats also want to change New York\u2019s voting law to allow people to register to vote on the same day they cast a ballot, and to let people cast an absentee ballot without supplying an excuse. Those changes will take more time, however, because they require amending the state constitution. To do that, lawmakers will have to pass constitutional amendments in two consecutive legislative sessions, and voters then have to approve it through a statewide referendum. Democrats say they plan to pass constitutional amendments to implement no-excuse absentee voting and eliminate the 10-day registration cutoff in the state constitution, but the next legislative session \u2015 the second of two in which they would have to pass those measures \u2015 doesn\u2019t begin until 2021.\n\nMike Long, the chairman of the state\u2019s Conservative Party, told The Buffalo News that establishing early voting would help boost Democratic turnout. But a 2017 paper from political scientists at the University of Wisconsin found that early voting established without same-day registration \u2015 which will be the circumstances in New York, at least temporarily \u2015 actually boosts GOP turnout.\n\nDemocrats also support legislation to automatically register voters when they interact with a state agency, but that measure isn\u2019t among those lawmakers plan to take up Monday. The first pieces of legislation likewise don\u2019t address the extremely early cutoff date by which voters must change their party if they want to vote in a primary contest.\n\nState Sen. Michael Gianaris, a top Democrat, told The New York Times lawmakers will act on more legislation as the session progresses.\n\nSusan Lerner, executive director of the New York chapter of Common Cause, a good government group that has championed the reforms, said it was significant that lawmakers were focusing on voting in the first substantive bill they would pass. She said she expected to work with lawmakers on more reforms like automatic voter registration and restoring voting rights to people with felony convictions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very ambitious to expect that the legislature would end basically 100 years of drought on election reform in one day in one bill,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat said, they are passing what is truly meaningful reform. And it\u2019s a fabulous first step towards catching New York up with the rest of the country. That doesn\u2019t mean that there still isn\u2019t plenty to be done.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-for-the-people-act_us_5c5a0c73e4b09293b209343c": "The country is in desperate need of more volunteer poll workers, who spend 14- to 15-hour days making sure people can exercise their right to vote. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is claiming Democrats\u2019 effort to get more federal workers to help is actually a corrupt scheme to steal elections.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 proposal is part of a major voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reform bill that McConnell has railed against for weeks. Along with making Election Day a federal holiday, the For The People Act would give federal workers up to six days off to train and work the polls for elections.\n\n\u201cThis is the Democrat plan to restore democracy?\u201d McConnell asked. \u201cA brand-new week of paid vacation for every federal employee who would like to hover around while you cast your ballot?\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s implication is clear: working the polls is an easy job that presents the opportunity for corrupt interference.\n\nIn reality, poll workers are holding elections together. Being a poll worker is hard work that is mostly done by senior citizens and retirees who have time to volunteer. Polling places are routinely understaffed and workers are often undertrained. There is little to no evidence of poll workers committing voter fraud.\n\n\u201cPoll workers really ensure that our democracy can function appropriately,\u201d said Aerion Abney, Pennsylvania state director for All Voting Is Local, a voting rights nonprofit.\n\n\u201cAnd without poll workers, we can\u2019t really hold elections,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons behind the poll workers provision in the legislation. Bipartisan federal election commissions and local election officials around the country have raised the alarm about persistent shortages of volunteers. These shortages lead to long lines and other problems for voters throughout the country.\n\n\u201cIt is a real challenge anymore to find poll workers. People don\u2019t seem to be as interested,\u201d Bobbie Holsclaw, the Jefferson County clerk in Kentucky, told a hearing about election security in the state just before the 2018 midterms.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decried a provision that could help fill a shortage of volunteer poll workers as a \"brand-new week of paid vacation for every federal employee who would like to hover around while you cast your ballot.\"\n\nNearly 65 percent of jurisdictions reported that it was either \u201cvery difficult\u201d or \u201csomewhat difficult\u201d to attract volunteer poll workers, according to a 2016 report by the Election Assistance Commission. This problem was especially acute in the most populated jurisdictions, where 88 percent found it either very or somewhat difficult to recruit enough poll workers.\n\nStates, counties and the federal government have offered a range of solutions over the years. Some states and counties pay poll workers an hourly salary. Others encourage or allow local government employees to take paid leave to work the polls. The federal government suggested that jurisdictions recruit high school students to work the polls.\n\nThe For The People Act\u2019s provision that would provide paid leave to federal workers to volunteer as poll workers is based on local policies providing paid leave to county employees and the 2013 report of a bipartisan commission on election administration convened by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThat report recommended that states give county employees paid leave to work the polls. Safeguards could be put in place \u201cdisallowing county employee poll worker service if the official to whom they report is a candidate on the ballot,\u201d it states.\n\nThe For The People Act provision would allow the federal Office of Personnel Management to write regulations \u201csetting the terms and conditions\u201d for federal workers taking paid leave to work the polls.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) signed a letter from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) calling on Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai to reject the merger between the third- and fourth-largest mobile service provider in the United States.\n\nThe proposed merger would leave Americans with just three wireless carriers with all the incentives to squeeze consumers for more money through increased prices and unnecessary fees, the letter argues. If approved, the merger would create a \u201ccountry-club market\u201d in which Verizon, AT&T and the new T-Mobile/Sprint could \u201cdivide the market, and collect ever-rising monthly rents from wireless subscribers with few real alternatives,\u201d according to the letter. (Verizon owns HuffPost.)\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) \u2014 who did not sign the letter \u2014 \u201cagrees with concerns expressed in the letter and hopes the Department of Justice rejects the proposed merger,\u201d according to a statement from Chris Harris, a spokesman for her Senate office.\n\nAdditionally, two potential but yet-unannounced Democratic presidential candidates, Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), also signed the Blumenthal letter.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS T-Mobile U.S. CEO and President John Legere testifies before the House commerce subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 13, 2019.\n\nThese Democratic senators have little power to stop the Trump administration from approving the T-Mobile/Sprint merger. Approval authority ultimately rests with the FCC and the Department of Justice.\n\nYet their stated opposition does show that the party\u2019s leading lights feel that it is important to take anti-monopoly stances in their pursuit of the presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party has increasingly embraced anti-monopoly and antitrust policies since the 2016 election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) labeled antitrust policy as one of the key planks in the party\u2019s new platform in a 2017 New York Times op-ed. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the new head of the House antitrust subcommittee, has promised to tackle head-on issues of consolidation in the pharmaceutical, hospital and tech industries.\n\nIn the recent past, Democrats have been more attentive to consolidation concerns in the telecommunications industry than in other sectors in which they allowed countless mergers during the presidency of Barack Obama. That could be due to the extreme consolidation already existing in this space. There are currently only four major mobile service providers \u2015 Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.\n\nThe Obama administration sued to block AT&T from purchasing T-Mobile in 2011 to prevent further consolidation that could raise prices and cost jobs. Then the Obama-era FCC prevented T-Mobile and Sprint from merging in 2014.\n\nThe Democratic Party has increasingly embraced anti-monopoly and antitrust policies since the 2016 election.\n\nThose same concerns exist in this second attempted merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. The Communications Workers of America argues that the merger will cost 30,000 jobs. Other telecommunications law experts argue that the merger will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers, who already pay among the highest prices for mobile service in the world. Rural mobile service advocates argued that the merger will dramatically increase costs for people living in areas with poor mobile service coverage and do little to improve that coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic 2020 candidates are rightfully expressing concerns and opposition to the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger, but the negative effects and potential damage of the merger should not be a partisan issue,\u201d said Shane Larson, director of legislation, politics and international affairs at the Communications Workers of America.\n\nThe Democratic candidates may be opposed to the merger, but an anti-monopoly spirit has not taken over the party entirely.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), a past critic of the telecommunications industry, declared her support for the merger at a congressional committee hearing on Wednesday. The country\u2019s telecommunications market is already dominated by the duopoly of Verizon and AT&T, she said. So, instead of breaking up these monopolies, T-Mobile and Sprint should be allowed to merge to create a third giant to take the Big Two on, she argued.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-maher-donald-trump-national-emergency_n_5c67be31e4b05c889d1f808f": "Bill Maher began Friday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cReal Time\u201d with a blistering dissection of President Donald Trump\u2019s Rose Garden declaration of a national emergency to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cHe did it, fucko did it today,\u201d said Maher, who described Trump\u2019s address as \u201cjust completely crackers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve said that before, but this was just one long, baseless, incoherent, stream of consciousness, call-the-nursing-home rant,\u201d he added.\n\nMaher later repeated his theory, which he previously made in the days before the 2016 election, about how a slow-moving right-wing coup is taking over the country.

Thanks to the new lower federal income tax rates, Callori\u2019s employer, a financial services firm, was withholding less from her paycheck for federal tax purposes.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, Trump is great, I love him,\u2019\u201d Callori said.\n\nBut last week Callori heard from her tax preparer that she owes the federal government more than $5,000 \u2015 almost five times as much as she had to pay in previous years.\n\n\u201cI almost fell out of my chair. I could not believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cI voted for Trump. I thought he was going to be good for this country, but when I got that phone call, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nCallori\u2019s tax bill went up for two reasons. One is that the law directly disadvantaged her by limiting deductions for state and local taxes, which increased the amount of Callori\u2019s income subject to tax and added an extra grand to her bill.\n\nThe bigger reason is that her employer withheld too little from her paycheck. The extra $90 she received should have been added to the amount that gets automatically socked away to cover the federal income tax. Like most people, however, Callori did not fill out a worksheet and submit a new Form W-4 to her employer at the beginning of last year.\n\nAfter all, at that time Republicans kept bragging about the bigger paychecks they had given the American people.\n\n\u201cI thought because I was getting that, I\u2019m entitled to it,\u201d Callori said.\n\nBigger Paychecks, Lower Refunds\n\nThe vast majority of Americans got lower taxes from the new law, while only 5 percent or so should have seen a tax increase. Most people should have seen the changes in their paychecks last February.\n\nBut the way the Trump administration implemented the law has caused a separate problem \u2015 one that the administration knew would result in something like 5 million fewer households receiving tax refunds this year. It\u2019s still early in tax filing season, which opened at the end of January, but the average refund is down 8.7 percent so far.\n\nThe Treasury Department suggested tax refunds are bad anyway because they result from people overpaying the government.\n\n\u201cSmaller refunds mean that people are withholding appropriately based on their tax liability, which is positive news for taxpayers,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s not just smaller refunds \u2015 it\u2019s that paycheck withholding for this tax season is less accurate in general.\n\nTreasury has said it expected the percentage of people withholding too much tax in their paychecks to decline from 76 to 73 percent, but the percentage withholding accurately is not increasing at all. Instead, Treasury expected the rate of under-withholding to go from 18 to 21 percent. Those people all owe the IRS.\n\nThe households most at risk are ones with higher incomes, two earners and slightly more complicated taxes \u2015 especially households that used to itemize their deductions. Instead of taking the standard deduction, which reduces taxable income by a set value, itemizers would add up what they spent on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable giving, and deduct that sum instead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the advantage of itemizing and limited the deduction for state and local tax.\n\nPolitics Over Planning\n\nBut the Trump administration decided not to make major changes to the withholding tables that employers are required to use to make sure everybody is paying the right amount of tax. The value of \u201callowances\u201d that workers can choose on Form W-4 to adjust their withholding has been pegged for years to something called the personal exemption \u2015 which the new tax law eliminated. So they set the value of allowances to last year\u2019s personal exemption and adjusted for inflation.\n\nComing up with new forms would have taken at least half a year, and would have been a chore for everyone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this tension \u2026 You\u2019d like to get all the information needed to calculate withholding as accurately as possible, but that gets very complicated for taxpayers,\u201d said Joe Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe administration could have let people withhold too much rather than surprise them with bills at tax time, Democrats have said.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Trump Treasury Department spent 2018, an election year, goosing people\u2019s paychecks by under-withholding, and it should have been obvious that the bill would come due eventually,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe IRS did try to warn people to check their withholding. The agency told the Government Accountability Office that it put out press releases and sent emails to listservs with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. It promoted a \u201cpaycheck checkup\u201d campaign on Twitter and Facebook, and officials talked to the media.\n\nThe \u201cmake sure you\u2019re not underwithheld\u201d messaging may have been drowned out by congressional Republicans bragging that their law had turbocharged the economy and directly benefited millions of workers. They kept a running tally of the hundreds of firms that had announced bonuses for their employees, trumpeting each announcement in a series of press releases. Fox News worked overtime to remind people that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously called the bonuses \u201ccrumbs,\u201d as though that weren\u2019t a perfectly accurate description.\n\nAnother problem, which is not Republicans\u2019 fault, is that even though everyone pays taxes, not everyone understands them very well. Less than half of Americans said they knew they could update their W-4 forms at any time and only 19 percent had actually done so, according to a November survey by the tax prep company H&R Block. Twice as many survey respondents said they updated their W-2, which is actually a document prepared by employers, not workers.\n\nAlso, some filers are surprised by tax bills simply because they didn\u2019t realize some of the money they earned needed to be taxed. \u201cThey\u2019ll have some side job where there\u2019s no withholding and that\u2019s creating this new tax liability,\u201d H&R Block\u2019s Nathan Rigney said, pointing to the rise of non-employee gigs like Uber and Taskrabbit.\n\nCrunching Numbers\n\nBy capping deductions for state and local taxes, Republicans knew the tax hikes in their law would be concentrated on states with high taxes \u2015 which tend to be led by Democrats, who use the taxes to provide more social services.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just wealthy New Yorkers who\u2019ve wound up paying more.\n\nKurt Kromm is an electrician in Kenosha, Wisconsin \u2015 an area that used to be represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Kromm knew he and his wife would pay higher taxes because of the limit on deductions for state and local taxes, but he didn\u2019t think they would owe more than $4,000 this spring.\n\nKromm had already indicated on the Form W-4 documents he\u2019d previously submitted to his employer that he was married and wanted zero allowances, which means he was withholding as much as he could without specifying an additional dollar amount.\n\n\u201cI figured married and zero would probably be appropriate,\u201d Kromm said. \u201cThey spent no time trying to really put out a decent withholding table.\u201d\n\nKromm\u2019s case shows the two-earner household pitfall. After he realized how much he owes, he went to the withholding calculator on IRS.gov and realized he could have either told his employer to take an additional $80 per week or just chosen to withhold at a single rate on his W-4, since single people face higher rates and therefore higher withholding. If he had done so last year, he could have had less money in each paycheck but saved himself the aggravation of making a large payment.\n\nBut not even the administration expected people to go to such lengths \u2015 in its simulations of how people would be affected, the IRS assumed nobody would adjust their W-4s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to expect working people with busy lives to start the year out by crunching the numbers on their tax withholding with the rigor of a workaholic [certified public accountant],\u201d Wyden said.\n\nBeth Callori, for her part, said she had also previously chosen zero allowances \u2015 plus she had an extra $130 withheld from each paycheck. It wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nShe said she used to love Donald Trump.

(The state Senate, which was not up for re-election in 2017, is in cycle in 2019.)\n\nUnified control of Virginia\u2019s state government could usher in a period of progressive lawmaking the likes of which the state has not experienced in decades \u2015 if at all.\n\nSome items on Democrats\u2019 agenda if they take control include raising the state\u2019s minimum wage and permanently restoring voting rights to former felons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, unified control would enable Democrats to run the redistricting process in 2021, preventing a repeat of the 2011 drawing in which Republicans heavily gerrymandered the congressional and state legislative district boundaries.\n\nBut a governor is the de facto face of a party \u2015 its chief fundraiser and advocate in the media. Candidates for state legislature frequently lack the name recognition that a highly visible figure like the governor wields.\n\nIf Northam remains in power, Democrats would not only lack the chance to deploy him as an asset in November, but also suffer from Republican willingness to turn him into a liability.\n\nNotwithstanding the Virginia GOP\u2019s willingness to traffic in explicit racial incitement \u2015 look no further than Ed Gillespie\u2019s gubernatorial bid and Corey Stewart\u2019s run for U.S. Senate \u2015 the party has pounced on the racist Northam photo.\n\nOur call for Ralph Northam's resignation stands.

While such political spending has been legal in some forms since the 1970s, it exploded in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nMost of the liberal spending in 2018 came from a single group: Majority Forward, a nonprofit controlled by allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The group reported $46 million in spending to the Federal Election Commission, about one-third of the total money spent. Another group linked to Schumer, Patriot Majority, spent an additional $5.7 million. Both groups were trying to defend a slew of Democratic incumbents in states President Donald Trump had won two years earlier.\n\nMajority Forward\u2019s heavy spending fueled a significant shift from earlier midterm election cycles. In 2010, conservative dark-money groups outspent liberal ones by an 11-to-1 margin, according to the report. In 2014, the margin was more than 3-to-1.\n\nMuch of the shift is also due to conservative groups \u2015 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the powerful Koch Network of donors \u2015 spending less than in previous elections, and to other conservative groups focusing on so-called issue ads instead of ads directly attacking or supporting candidates.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Zach Wamp, a member of an advisory board for Issue One, said Democrats\u2019 embrace of dark money was a reason for Republicans to support reforms to force disclosure.\n\n\u201cThis should be a wake-up call to Republicans,\u201d Wamp said in a statement. \u201cSecret spending in elections has the potential to denigrate every candidate in every election, and candidates are losing complete control of the messages in their campaigns to these outside groups.\u201d\n\nWhile Schumer and other Democrats have called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision and other measures to force groups to disclose their donors, many have defended the use of dark-money groups, arguing the party shouldn\u2019t unilaterally disarm in the face of Republican attacks.\n\nWhile most of Majority Forward\u2019s donors will never be revealed, the group received a $350,000 donation from Michael Arougheti, the CEO of private equity firm Ares Management and a $250,000 donation from William Conway, the co-founder of The Carlyle Group, another private equity firm, according to public records. CVS Health Corp., the parent company of the pharmacy chain, donated $250,000, and a group backed by Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer gave $200,000.\n\nDemocrats running for the 2020 nomination for president have largely sworn off corporate PAC money, and most have said they don\u2019t want super PACs \u2015 which are independent of any campaign \u2015 to back them.

Some said Schneiderman was a heavy drinker.\n\nThe allegations tarnished Schneiderman\u2019s reputation as a defender of women an supporter of the #MeToo movement. Months before he left office, he filed a lawsuit aimed at securing better compensation for movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct accusers.\n\nMichelle Manning Barish, a Democratic activist and writer who accused Schneiderman of abusing her when they dated in 2013, said he should have been forced to pay his lawyers out of his own pocket.\n\n\u201cThat money was given in good faith by donors who expected Mr. Schneiderman to help women,\u201d Manning Barish said. \u201cWhat a luxury to be able to assault women who donated to your campaign and then use their money to defend yourself.\u201d\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s personal legal bills, totaling $339,710, accounted for almost half of his re-election committee\u2019s spending in the eight months since he left office, the records show.

On Jan. 10, the day Trump visited the U.S.-Mexico border, the app sent a new question to users: \u201cDo you support the wall?\u201d Eleven thousand people answered the question that day, and the number has climbed to 1.5 million since then. While 87 percent said they don\u2019t support the wall at all, 8 percent said they do; 3 percent said they support building a wall if Mexico pays, and the remaining 2 percent said they only support the wall if Mexico doesn\u2019t have to pay.\n\nOkCupid, like most dating apps, won\u2019t share its exact number of users or any specific demographic breakdowns. But Hobley said the users skew millennial and urban, two groups that tend to lean liberal, with an even number of men and women.

Millennial women, unsurprisingly, are the most likely to prioritize politics in online dating. Seventy-three percent of them (compared to 56 percent of millennial men) have told OkCupid they\u2019re looking to date someone of the same political party, and half of all women on the app say they won\u2019t date someone who doesn\u2019t vote in elections.\n\nIn 2017, the app started allowing people to put badges on their profiles that indicated support for Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, prompting The Federalist to publish a widely mocked essay titled, \u201cYour Refusal to Date Conservatives Is One Reason We Have Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHuffPost asked people on Twitter whether they considered politics a deal-breaker in online dating and received dozens of responses.\n\nSeveral women said they won\u2019t even date a man who indicates on his bio that he\u2019s \u201cmoderate; in this increasingly polarized atmosphere, they assume that probably means he\u2019s conservative.\n\n\u201cI never swipe right if they are conservative or \u2018moderate,\u2019\u201d Olivia, a 23-year-old in New York, wrote to me. \u201cIn NYC saying you\u2019re moderate is just a lie covering up for the fact that you want to get a date but are a conservative, which [in my opinion] is worse than just being a Trump Supporter in the 1st place.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the worst worst worst guys,\u201d she added, \u201care the ones that say \u2018apolitical,\u2019 because they must be living on a different planet.\u201d\n\nConservatives are so frustrated by reports of this phenomenon that they\u2019ve launched a few of their own dating apps.\n\nJason, a 39-year-old man in a conservative area in Kentucky, said he doesn\u2019t indicate his liberal politics in his dating profile \u201cpartly out of fear.\u201d But he filters out conservative women.\n\n\u201cIt sucks that so much of the country is resorting to tribalism, but one side believes in equality for all while the other exists only for rich, white, straight, cis men,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe some people can live with \u2018agreeing to disagree\u2019 on things like that, but I just couldn\u2019t live with myself if I did.\u201d\n\nConservatives are so frustrated by reports of this phenomenon that they\u2019ve launched a few of their own dating apps, including Righter, Patrio and Donald Daters. Righter, founder Christy Edwards Lawton told The Daily Beast that conservatives have been discriminated against in online dating and that she might sue any liberals who try to join her app, just out of bitterness.\n\nHobley doesn\u2019t see OkCupid\u2019s political screening as discrimination. Younger generations are just becoming more politically engaged and \u2015 in part as a reaction to the current administration \u2015 recognizing shared values as central to a good romantic relationship, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is so counter to what previous generations did, or what your own parents told you: \u2018Don\u2019t talk politics or religion until you\u2019ve been dating a while,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNot only are people not waiting till the third or fourth date \u2015 people are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t even want to see you as a potential match if you don\u2019t vote.\u2019\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-democrats-voting-rights-bill_us_5c51ee80e4b04f8645c716ce": "The act contains a package of reforms geared toward making voting more accessible to all Americans. It faced swift condemnation from McConnell, who penned an op-ed against the bill earlier this month, and House Republicans, who accused Democrats of trying to manipulate elections.\n\nThe bill would force President Donald Trump, as well as future presidential candidates, to release their tax returns and would require super PACs to make their private donors public as a way of incentivizing smaller donations.\n\nThe bill also aims to make Election Day a paid holiday for federal workers \u2015 a proposal that might encourage private businesses to do likewise, thus allowing more voters to get to the polls.\n\nThere are some indicators that show increasing voter turnout might benefit Democratic candidates.

Scott Walker signed late last year.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Peterson said the changes to Wisconsin\u2019s voting law, which included limiting early voting to two weeks before an election, violated a 2016 court order blocking the state from making similar changes. Ruling on a lawsuit against the limits, he said it wasn\u2019t even a close case.\n\nIn 2016 he blocked a Wisconsin law that restricted early voting to two weeks before an election on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Counties could have only one early voting location. The measure that state Republicans passed in December \u2015 and was blocked Thursday \u2015 also allowed only two weeks of early voting but didn\u2019t restrict it to weekdays and said it could take place at any time.\n\nIn his earlier ruling, Peterson blocked Wisconsin from enforcing \u201cthe state-imposed limits on the time for in-person absentee voting,\u201d he wrote. Putting a two-week cap on early voting, he said, violated his order. He was unpersuaded by an argument that his 2016 order didn\u2019t apply because Wisconsin had passed a new law.\n\n\u201cThe scope of the injunction relates to conduct that the court concluded was unlawful; the particular statutory provisions at issue are not important,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAn appeal of Peterson\u2019s 2016 order is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.\n\nThe state\u2019s Gov.

I\u2019m glad to see that a federal court has again struck down Republicans\u2019 unconstitutional attacks on our right to vote,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCritics said Wisconsin Republicans passed the voting restrictions because they were stung after losing all five statewide races this fall. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) blamed Walker\u2019s loss in the governor\u2019s race on Milwaukee and Dane counties, both of which allowed for almost six weeks of early voting.\n\nPeterson also blocked two provisions in the lame-duck law that barred students from using an expired student ID to vote and allowed them to use a temporary ID only within 60 days of getting it. Those restrictions were blocked by his 2016 court order as well.\n\nThe suit was filed by One Wisconsin Institute and Citizen Action of Wisconsin Education Fund, progressive advocacy groups, with backing from the National Redistricting Foundation, part of a Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder focused on voting-rights issues.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s court ruling is a victory for the citizens of Wisconsin and a rebuke to their defeated former governor and his cronies in the state legislature,\u201d Holder said in a statement. \u201cEvery voter in the state should be asking one question: why are Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature so afraid of the people they claim they want to represent?

Cheri Bustos (Ill.), the newly elected chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is under scrutiny for a lack of progressives in leadership roles.\n\nSeveral progressive organizations criticized the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s leadership for lacking representation from the party\u2019s left wing.\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos (Ill.), the newly elected chairwoman of the DCCC, which helps elect Democrats to the U.S. House, announced her leadership team on Wednesday, according to Politico.\n\nBustos has tapped Reps. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), Val Demings (Fla.) and Donald McEachin (Va.) to head up the DCCC\u2019s candidate recruitment efforts for the 2020 election cycle. And she selected Reps. Ami Bera (Calif.), Suzan DelBene (Wash.) and Brad Schneider (Ill.) to lead the campaign arm\u2019s Frontline program to defend vulnerable incumbents in the House.\n\nAlthough the lineup boasts significant racial and gender diversity, all seven DCCC leaders, including Bustos, hail from the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition. Not a single one of the DCCC members belongs to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which, with more than 95 members, is the largest single bloc within the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nThat\u2019s a source of concern for some progressive groups that were critical of the DCCC in the 2018 election cycle for preferring to recruit moderate House candidates with proven fundraising capabilities.\n\n\u201cAt a time when progressive members of the new class of Democrats, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are dominating national headlines and gaining grassroots supporters, the DCCC has missed another opportunity to engage where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party and in American politics,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, communications director of Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that plans to run primary candidates against moderate House Democrats who have safe seats.\n\nThe only way we\u2019ll get a Congress that looks like America is if progressives recruit, train and help everyday working people to run for office. Randy Bryce, Working Families Party\n\nDiane May, a spokeswoman for Our Revolution, the successor organization for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, argued that successful House candidates ran on a progressive message in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe DCCC would do well to incorporate members from the Congressional Progressive Caucus in candidate recruitment efforts to ensure that we continue building on the gains we made in 2018 in future elections,\u201d May said.\n\nRandy Bryce, a progressive ironworker who ran for Congress in Wisconsin with the support of both the DCCC and liberal groups, nonetheless took the party body to task for overlooking people with more modest socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that the DCCC supported my campaign, but there\u2019s no question that they are more likely to pick millionaires than people like me,\u201d said Bryce, who became a senior adviser to the left-leaning Working Families Party after losing his race in November. \u201cThe only way we\u2019ll get a Congress that looks like America is if progressives recruit, train and help everyday working people to run for office.\u201d\n\nDCCC Communications Director Jared Smith said that the exclusion of CPC members in the campaign arm\u2019s leadership team was not deliberate.\n\n\u201cServing on the recruitment and Frontline program is something members volunteer to do \u2015 these members stepped up and sought out leadership roles, and we\u2019re honored to have their help so we can defend and expand the new Democratic majority,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith also noted that a majority of the team is made up of people of color \u2015 Demings and McEachin are black; Aguilar is Latino; and Bera is of South Asian descent \u2015 and that no one from the CPC ran for DCCC chair. Bustos defeated DelBene and Rep. Denny Heck (Wash.), neither of whom are in the CPC, in a Democratic caucus election for the top post.\n\nIn addition, there will be other DCCC leadership positions for progressive members to fill in the future, according to Smith.\n\nBut the ideological makeup of the DCCC\u2019s recruitment and Frontline teams is a marked change from the last election cycle, when the recruitment team included two CPC members: Reps. Don Beyer (Va.) and Katherine Clark (Mass.). The DCCC\u2019s WomenLEAD program, aimed specifically at recruiting and mentoring female candidates, was co-chaired by CPC members Debbie Dingell (Mich.) and Lois Frankel (Fla.), as well as Demings.\n\nThe public squabble over progressive representation in DCCC leadership partly reflects a debate over the lessons from the successful 2018 midterm election.\n\nAn outsize share of the candidates who flipped Republican House districts had the backing of the New Democrat Coalition and the still more conservative Blue Dog Coalition.\n\nAnd though The Intercept chronicled how narrow DCCC recruitment criteria ended up yielding mixed results in the 2006 and 2008 Democratic waves, the party establishment had a nearly flawless record in 2018. Progressive candidates running in GOP-held districts defeated DCCC-endorsed candidates just twice in 2018 primaries; both progressive candidates \u2015 Dana Balter in New York and Kara Eastman in Nebraska \u2015 went on to lose in the general election.\n\nBut 11 of the 40 Democrats who flipped Republican House seats had the CPC\u2019s backing.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hotel-emoluments-clause_us_5c3f9f5ee4b0a8dbe16d482e": "A \u201cconstitutional cloud\u201d hangs over President Donald Trump\u2019s lease to operate a hotel out of the government-owned Old Post Office Building in Washington, D.C., according to a new government report.\n\nThe General Services Administration\u2019s inspector general found Wednesday that the agency ignored the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses when it reviewed the 2014 deal in light of Trump\u2019s 2016 election win. The GSA had concluded in March 2017 that the hotel was not in violation of its lease, which forbids any benefits going to elected officials.\n\nBut according to the new watchdog report, lawyers at the agency did not investigate whether the Constitution\u2019s domestic or foreign emoluments clauses posed a problem for a hotel owned by the president of the United States. The emoluments clauses prohibit federal officials from receiving any financial or material benefit from a foreign government, a U.S. state government or any part of the federal government. The report also found that there was no undue influence involved in the approval of the lease.\n\n\u201cWe found that GSA recognized that the President\u2019s business interest in the [Old Post Office] lease raised issues under the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clauses that might cause a breach of the lease; however, GSA decided not to address those issues in connection with the management of the lease,\u201d the inspector general report says. That decision, it continued, \u201cleaves a constitutional cloud over the lease.\u201d\n\nSince Trump came into office, his Trump International Hotel in D.C. has been a source of controversy, as lobbyists, foreign governments and corporate executives have patronized the establishment in a bid to curry favor with the White House.\n\nThe report was the result of multiple requests to the inspector general\u2019s office from members of Congress and good-government groups to investigate the management of the president\u2019s lease. These requests largely came from congressional Democrats who were then in the minority in Congress. These members now control the oversight committees in the House of Representatives.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS GSA lawyers chose to ignore the Constitution's emoluments clauses as they reviewed Donald Trump's lease to operate a hotel in a government building after he won the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThis devastating new report from the Inspector General is proof that President Trump should have divested his business interests rather than ignoring the advice of ethics experts,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in a statement.\n\nCummings added that the GSA has refused to provide documents he has requested on this issue for the past two years.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump stood in violation of the Constitution the moment he took office, and compounded the problem by improperly holding the lease on a government building,\u201d Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group that filed complaints with the GSA over Trump\u2019s hotel, said in a statement. \u201cThe corruption of the presidency has never been clearer.\u201d\n\nThe GSA, which manages much of the government\u2019s property, awarded the Trump Organization with a lease to run a luxury hotel out of the Old Post Office building in 2014 after a competitive bidding process. The president\u2019s company opened the hotel in October 2016 in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. While the agency had months to look into potential issues with a president holding a government lease, they did not look into the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses until after Trump won the election, according to the report.\n\nIn December 2016, GSA lawyers decided that they would ignore concerns about the emoluments clause, the report found. They claimed that their agency did not have the purview to examine constitutional issues.\n\nBut the inspector general report shows otherwise: Not only had the GSA previously investigated emoluments clause concerns in nonbinding decisions, but the lawyers ignored their own past work. Nor did the lawyers consult past opinions by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which had determined that the emoluments clauses apply to the president and that past presidents had gone to great lengths to avoid even the appearance of a violation. Beyond ignoring these past OLC findings, the GSA\u2019s lawyers did not even reach out to the OLC to ask for guidance.\n\nThe GSA\u2019s failure to investigate these constitutional concerns led it to a problematic decision to affirm that the government could continue to lease the Old Post Office Building to the president\u2019s company, the inspector general concluded. This question came up because the lease agreement included a provision that specifically forbade any \u201celected official of the Government of the United States\u201d to \u201cbe admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\u201d\n\nThe GSA decided that the president was not in violation of this lease agreement, even though the agency never fully investigated the legal and constitutional questions at hand, according to the report.\n\n\u201cAs a result, GSA foreclosed an early resolution of these issues, including a possible solution satisfactory to all parties; and the uncertainty over the lease remains unresolved,\u201d the report says.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/twitter-2020-presidential-candidates_us_5c377f48e4b0c469d76c168f": "We hate to say it, but it seems pretty clear that Twitter is going to be important in the 2020 election. Why? Because despite all of the anger and nonsense, Twitter is where journalists and activists hang out. It is where a lot of savvy people get their news, where opinions are formed and debates are framed.\n\nSo we were wondering: Can any good come of this? Now that we\u2019re in the early days of the 2020 election, rather than simply hitting retweet on the best Chris Cillizza slams, can we actually learn something about the shape of the race from Twitter data?\n\nSo we went to work, downloading data on the followers of six front-running Democrats \u2015 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas). We also worked out who their followers follow, giving us a detailed picture of what Beto Twitter looks like compared to Warren Twitter, and so on. Obviously, not everyone who follows a given account will support the candidate \u2015 our data reveals, for example, that over 45 percent of Biden, Sanders and Warren followers also follow President Donald Trump. But the data does offer us a refracted look at the context in which their candidacy is being viewed.\n\nSo what did we discover? We can show that Warren might be the other potential candidate who Sanders\u2019 followers are most interested in hearing from \u2015 but the feeling apparently isn\u2019t mutual for Warren\u2019s followers. We can also reveal that Biden\u2019s followers have the least interest in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and make one hypothesis on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s meteoric rise.\n\nHow We Did It\n\nTo mine this data, we had to work within the limitations of Twitter\u2019s tools \u2015 this is the bit that stats nerds will find most interesting. For our initial samples, we took 100,000 followers of each from the six potential candidates. For those who have multiple Twitter accounts \u2015 for example, Bernie has both @BernieSanders and @SenSanders \u2015 we chose the account more closely linked to their campaign rather than their office, which in all cases happily turned out to be the account with more followers anyway.\n\nSo we had six sets of 100,000 followers, each made up of the followers that Twitter spat back at us when we queried its servers \u2015 which, considering how Twitter works, is most likely each account\u2019s more recent followers. We then randomly crunched the numbers on 8,000 followers from each of these large samples so we could work out who they, in turn, are following.\n\nFor byzantine technical reasons, we discounted any accounts following 5,000 or more accounts. This could arguably make the data more useful, as we\u2019re more likely to capture data on users who might actually stand a chance of consuming candidates\u2019 content, rather than users who follow many thousands of accounts for other reasons.\n\nEach potential candidate\u2019s sample size is slightly different from the rest, but we believe each sample is broadly statistically significant to a 99 percent confidence level with around a 1.5 percent margin of error, as long as you generally accept our methodology.\n\nThe other obvious caveat is that the samples are not weighted by demographics or other factors, so this is not analogous to a high-quality, scientific poll. Let\u2019s not go wild and start drawing concrete conclusions from this data.\n\nThis is a snapshot of the potential social media dynamics of the coming primary, demonstrating the interests and preferences of the followers of six major potential candidates. It tells us which other candidates and Twitter accounts could have the most influence or strongest ability to reach followers of each candidate. In other words: We know that Twitter isn\u2019t reflective of the real world, but the dynamics in the social media war will matter \u2015 so this is more of an attempt to provide some data points to help understand that.\n\nBlue On Blue\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at what proportion of each candidate\u2019s followers also follow the five other politicians we have looked at, and indulge in some wild speculation.\n\nFirst up, here\u2019s a look at the account for Warren \u2015 the only one of the six who has declared she plans to run. The results for her recently renamed @ewarren account are perhaps not what you might expect. Despite her position on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, Booker is the potential candidate in whom her followers are otherwise most interested. Booker is sometimes framed as a more corporatist or centrist Democrat, but 32 percent of Warren\u2019s followers follow him \u2015 while just 18 percent of Warren\u2019s followers follow Sanders, arguably her closest ideological rival.\n\nSo what about Sanders himself? Warren is by some distance the other candidate that his 8.96 million followers are most interested in hearing from; 52.5 percent of his followers also follow her. Of our sample, the candidate whom Bernie followers are least interested in is Biden \u2015 but to keep this apparent ideological distance in perspective, the former vice president is still followed by 30 percent of Sanders\u2019 followers.\n\nThe relative disinterest in Biden, however, does appear to be mutual. According to this data, only 20 percent of his 3.2 million followers are also following Sanders.\n\nNow here\u2019s Booker. What\u2019s perhaps most striking is how his followers are less likely to follow the other candidates (compared to, say, Sanders). Just 24 percent of his followers also follow Harris, and she\u2019s the other potential candidate his followers are most interested in. Sanders performs the worst, with just under 10 percent of Booker\u2019s followers also following the Vermont senator.\n\nThis is actually pretty surprising. If we had made a guess before running the numbers, we would have guessed the opposite: Given that Sanders has a much higher profile off the back of 2016, surely he would be the candidate with the fewest mutuals? Wouldn\u2019t many of his followers be average Americans, not nerds like us who follow lots of politicians and read detailed data analyses? But this suggests otherwise \u2015 that Booker has forged the most \u201cindependent\u201d Twitter footprint, compared to the other candidates. Why? We have no idea.\n\nHarris is in almost the opposite situation as Booker, as she has the single biggest overlap with another potential candidate. Amazingly, 60 percent of her followers also follow Booker.\n\nAnd finally, what of the Democrats\u2019 new wunderkind, O\u2019Rourke, who is a youthful, umm, 46 years old? His followers appear most interested in Booker, Harris and Warren, with Biden and Sanders proving less enticing. So maybe add this as fuel to the fire in the ongoing Beto/Bernie Twitter war...\n\nInfluential Voices?\n\nWe also looked at which Twitter accounts are the most popular among the followers of each of the six candidates, in hopes of giving a more detailed snapshot of which voices could conceivably influence the social media conversation during the primary.\n\nFor example, Oprah Winfrey is followed by 37 percent of Cory followers \u2015 which arguably makes her a slightly more influential voice on \u201cBooker Twitter\u201d than \u201cBeto Twitter.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Rachel Maddow is hugely influential in several of the potential candidates\u2019 Twitter worlds \u2015 a significant proportion of every candidates\u2019 following are also following the MSNBC host. (It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the other candidates follow in the footsteps of Warren by heading over to Maddow\u2019s studio for a long-form interview once they say they have plans to run.)\n\nIt\u2019s also striking to see how many of the potential candidates\u2019 followers follow Ocasio-Cortez, Congress\u2019 biggest new star. Despite having only been a national figure for a few months, Twitter data suggests what is obvious in the real world: Ocasio-Cortez is well-positioned to be hugely influential in the primary. Over 50 percent of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s followers also follow her (and she even already has double the number of followers that he does), as do over 40 percent of the followers for both Warren and Sanders. Only Biden\u2019s followers seem less interested in what she has to say.\n\nThis data also contains some fun surprises. For example, it turns out Sanders\u2019 followers are most likely to follow SpaceX, even though that doesn\u2019t make much intuitive ideological sense. Our guess that it isn\u2019t all \u201cChapo Trap House\u201d listeners looking for material to dump on Elon Musk. Instead, it\u2019s probably more of a reflection of Sanders\u2019 mainstream success in 2016 \u2015 so his almost 9 million followers are perhaps more reflective of average Americans, with average interests, and not just people who read Jacobin.\n\nYou may be wondering how O\u2019Rourke became such a big deal so quickly. Yes, he\u2019s an impressive candidate. But some of his rise could have something to do with the fact that almost 9 percent of his 1.2 million followers also follow \u201cPod Save America,\u201d a podcast that consistently boosted him throughout his 2018 Senate campaign.\n\nChoose Your Own Twitter Argument\n\nNow here\u2019s the exciting part: You can forget our wild speculation about the data above and have your own fun. We\u2019ve built a tool to look into our data so that you can type in the name of a Twitter account, then see how popular that given account is among the followers of these six major potential candidates.

The reports added fuel to the fire surrounding the Women\u2019s March over yet another of the group\u2019s leaders, Linda Sarsour, who has attracted criticism for her Palestinian activism.\n\nJust this week Mallory, now the group\u2019s co-president, went on \u201cThe View\u201d and declined to denounce her controversial association with Louis Farrakhan, an African-American activist who is a preferred bogeyman for right-wing critics of progressives because of his track record of anti-Semitic remarks.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s March disagrees with the version of events outlined in both the Tablet and New York Times articles,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWomen\u2019s March exists to fight all forms of oppression and bigotry, including anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, racism, white supremacy, ableism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, classism, and ageism.\u201d The work continues with the marches this weekend, the group said.\n\nThe controversy has led to a fracturing among activists and progressives. Some groups aren\u2019t partnering with the march this year; a couple of progressive celebrities also distanced themselves. Prominent 2020 female candidates are split on this: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) won\u2019t be attending, her representative told HuffPost. But Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is scheduled to speak at the Iowa march.\n\nAt least one female politician told HuffPost she\u2019s having misgivings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably going to go, but I\u2019m sure as hell not going to talk about it on social media, and I\u2019ll probably wear sunglasses,\u201d said this politician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of being associated with anti-Semitism. She had been looking forward to attending this year too, she said, since the march has been a reliable way to find volunteers, network and campaign.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Participants in a women's march last year in Texas.\n\nOther female politicians said there was no question that they would attend. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), perhaps the best-known of the record number of women elected to Congress this year, said she had followed the controversy and was \u201cconcerned\u201d but told HuffPost she would be marching in New York. One of her colleagues, newly elected Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes, plans to march in her home state of Connecticut.\n\n\u201cNo one person owns the women\u2019s march or the women\u2019s movement,\u201d she told a HuffPost reporter in Washington on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s about people figuring out where they fit in. That\u2019s my real life. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m about.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversy at the top, the women on the ground are mobilizing. There are 300 marches planned around the U.S. on Saturday. And a separate organization, Women\u2019s March Global, has events planned in 30 countries.\n\nGoals are varied and include everything from ending violence against women to ensuring reproductive rights and LGBTQ rights to seeking environmental justice.\n\nBringing together all the women in the world was never going to be easy. And why would it be? To be sure, women of all stripes face discrimination. However, the way they experience that oppression has everything to do with other factors \u2014 income level, ethnicity and, of course, race.\n\nANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images Demonstrators on the National Mall in Washington for the 2017 Women's March.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re literally bringing together millions of women, it makes sense tensions emerge, but I think people are struck by them because we still think about women in politics as though they\u2019re cohesive,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia who studies gender.\n\nFeminist movements have long been plagued by fracturing, particularly in the United States, where activists must contend with the ways race intersects with gender and history is fraught with serious missteps, typically made by white women in the name of feminism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing happening now in terms of divisions and disagreements is not unusual,\u201d said Jo Reger, a sociology professor at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. \u201cIf we know our history, we can see how these patterns have been here before.\u201d\n\nWhite suffragists sold out black women, noted Reger, the author of the recently published anthology Nevertheless They Persisted: Feminisms and Continued Resistance in the U.S. Women\u2019s Movement. In the 1960s, white feminists didn\u2019t make room again for black women.\n\nMany of the activists who spoke to HuffPost said that although they were troubled by the reluctance of the Women\u2019s March to renounce its affiliation with Farrakhan and more recently Mallory\u2019s refusal to specifically renounce him, they weren\u2019t going to let that get in the way of what\u2019s shaping up to be essentially a revolution.\n\nThe reach, power and the excitement around the women\u2019s movement more generally was made clear just this month, when a record 102 women began terms in the House of Representatives, certainly in part because of the wave of activism that began the day after Trump was inaugurated in January 2017 \u2014 the biggest single-day demonstration in U.S. history.\n\nThe Women\u2019s March group also played a role in organizing women to run for office and in protests of Trump\u2019s family separation immigration policy, among other things. Of course, many other groups were involved as well.\n\nMany women everywhere still feel the urgent need to stand up to the president.\n\nStill, some organizers can\u2019t help feeling disappointed. One of them, who declined to be named for privacy concerns, told HuffPost she did not like how the Women\u2019s March handled accusations of anti-Semitism, though that wasn\u2019t going to keep her home this weekend.\n\n\u201cEven though I take issue with how the organization chose to handle this, there are actual white supremacist Nazis marching in the street,\u201d she said, alluding to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. \u201cFor us to turn our wrath on three women of color is troubling.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/william-barr-trump-whitehouse-doj-mueller_us_5c3cb4dbe4b0e0baf53fac44": "WASHINGTON \u2015 William Barr, the man President Donald Trump has nominated to become the nation\u2019s 85th attorney general, is trying to alleviate concerns about his potential oversight of Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing special counsel investigation examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Democrats are far from convinced that Barr \u2015 who\u2019s been nominated to replace frequent Trump foil and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2015 would protect the Russia probe, and plan to use Barr\u2019s confirmation hearing on Tuesday to extract additional commitments.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) \u2015 in a letter obtained by HuffPost that the senator hand-delivered to the 68-year-old Barr at a meeting on Thursday \u2015 laid out several lines of questioning ahead of Barr\u2019s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning. Whitehouse raised a number of questions he had for Barr about his communications with the Trump White House, Justice Department officials, and Trump\u2019s legal team.\n\nGetty William Barr (left), Trump's nominee for attorney general, sent a 19-page memo to Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein in June objecting to Robert Mueller's (right) investigation.\n\nWhitehouse\u2019s letter zeroes in on an unsolicited June 8, 2018 memorandum that Barr sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose anticipated departure has only heightened Democratic concerns about Barr\u2019s appointment. Barr\u2019s 19-page memo suggested that it wasn\u2019t legitimate for Mueller to investigate whether the president obstructed justice by pressuring former FBI Director James Comey to drop the FBI investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn the letter, Whitehouse also raised concerns that Trump might want Barr to play the role of Robert Bork, the former solicitor general who \u2015 after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned in protest \u2015 followed President Richard Nixon\u2019s order to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox as he investigated Nixon\u2019s role in Watergate. Whitehouse wrote about an agreement that Bork, then acting attorney general, signed in the wake of what became known as the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d that offered assurances about the independence of Leon Jaworkski, who replaced Cox as special prosecutor.\n\n\u201cYour agreement to follow in the footsteps of Robert Bork would provide significant assurances to those who fear your appointment is a prelude to another Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d Whitehouse wrote to Barr.\n\nBarr\u2019s confirmation hearing should make for compelling television. The Senate Judiciary Committee, now chaired by frequent Trump defender Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), includes several prominent Democrats, including a few who are expected to seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The hearing is taking place as the nearly 20-month-old Mueller probe enters a pivotal stage, as Mueller appears to be wrapping up his investigation and preparing a highly anticipated report on his conclusions that might jump-start a movement to impeach Trump in the Democratic-controlled House. And it all comes amid an ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left much of the Justice Department Barr hopes to head furloughed or working without pay.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate with 53 members, so Democrats can\u2019t do much to stop his confirmation on their own. But they can press Barr for commitments to insure the independence of the Mueller investigation as it enters a crucial timeframe.\n\nBarr, in prepared remarks provided to reporters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, seemed to be operating under the notion that he would seize control of the Mueller investigation after his confirmation. His prepared opening remarks make no reference to consulting with career ethics officials within DOJ about whether his unsolicited memo about the Mueller probe created an appearance of impropriety that might suggest he should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who defended Trump on cable news before joining the Justice Department, rejected the advice of a DOJ ethics official who suggested he should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. Whitaker, who was not confirmed by the Senate during the Trump administration, had faced questions over the legitimacy of his unprecedented appointment as acting attorney general following Sessions\u2019 forced resignation after the 2018 midterms.\n\nBarr\u2019s opening statement, however, operates on the assumption that he would in fact be in charge of the Mueller investigation upon his confirmation.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper considerations to interfere with this or any other investigation,\u201d Barr will say in his prepared remarks. \u201cI will follow the Special Counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work.\u201d\n\nBarr will also tell senators that he didn\u2019t pursue the position, and that he was \u201creluctant to be considered\u201d when his name first came up because he\u2019s 68, \u201cpartially retired, and nearing the end of a long legal career.\u201d He\u2019ll say that he and his wife were looking forward to spending time with their family, note that he\u2019d already had the gig before, and say he ultimately decided to accept the nomination because he believed in public service.\n\nAt least one Democrat on the committee said he thought that Barr\u2019s opening statement offers some reassurances, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Monday that Barr set a \u201cgood tone\u201d with his prepared remarks before the committee, adding that he \u201chelped himself significantly\u201d by addressing some questions regarding his past criticisms of the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee member added, however, that he still has outstanding concerns about Barr\u2019s views on presidential power, the use of pardons, and his willingness to submit to advice from the department\u2019s ethics officials.\n\n\u201cHis last confirmation hearing was 27 years ago \u2015 we can\u2019t pretend that these are similar times. These are very different times and I think its very important he makes his commitment to the rule of law and, in particular, the protection of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller,\u201d Coons said during a conference call with reporters.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-voting-reforms_us_5c3ceb42e4b01c93e00c92cf": "New York lawmakers approved a group of voting reform measures on Monday, putting a state where election reform has long stalled on the precipice of easing access to the ballot box.\n\nLawmakers passed a series of bills Monday that include establishing an early voting period, consolidating primary dates, automatically updating voter registrations when people move, and allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote. Despite its reputation as a progressive state, New York stuck out for its abysmal voter turnout and not having early voting, a practice in place in some deep red states. It was also the only state in the country in 2018 to have separate primaries for state and federal offices.\n\nThe early voting bill required each county to establish an early voting period that begins 10 days before election day and concludes two days before it. That period must include two full weekends and counties must establish one early voting site for every 50,000 voters up to seven sites, but could vote to authorize more.\n\nJohn Greim via Getty Images The New York State Capitol building in Albany, New York.\n\nAnother bill passed Monday would require the state to automatically update people\u2019s voter registration when they moved and notify officials of their change of address. Outside of New York City, when someone moved from one county to another, they had to submit a new registration by the voter registration deadline form to vote at their new address. The bill passed Monday makes it so residents no longer have to submit a new form.\n\nLast year, Democrats passed voting reforms in the state assembly, only to see them die in the Republican-controlled state senate. But when Democrats took control of the upper chamber in November, giving them control of both chambers of the legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion, they pledged to pass voting reform. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), told HuffPost Friday the governor intends to sign the bills into law.\n\nThe state senate also approved resolutions for constitutional amendments to let people vote absentee without an excuse and to eliminate a 10-day cutoff for registering for elections. The latter measure is necessary to implement same day registration. Lawmakers will need to pass those amendments in the next legislative session, which begins in 2021, in order to send them to the ballot for voters to approve.\n\nDebating the measures on the floor on Monday State Sen. Catharine Young (R) argued that many of the measures would open the door to election fraud and would be costly to implement.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, is designed to be bipartisan \u2015 two of the five commissioners that run the agency can\u2019t come from the president\u2019s party. While the Republican majority will always have the final say, there\u2019s a lot that a Democratic commissioner can do \u2015 document corporate abuses, lean on enforcement staff and negotiate with Republicans over the regulatory agenda.\n\nConsider the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra published a pointed memo about the need to punish \u201crecidivist\u201d corporate offenders. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Facebook, which has been operating under a consent order from the FTC since 2011. Under the order, Facebook had agreed to reform the way it tracked user data and shared those data with other companies. If Facebook violated the terms of that order \u2015 and the company\u2019s mounting heap of scandals makes it seem increasingly likely that it did \u2015 then, Chopra suggested, the FTC should take strong punitive measures to demonstrate that large corporations are not above the law.\n\nChopra can\u2019t force the Republican-controlled FTC to actually do anything. But his memo made quite a splash. Where in the past, weak regulators might have hurried to absolve Facebook with a slap-on-the-wrist penalty, Republicans at the FTC now face the prospect of public humiliation if they carry water for the tech company during its ongoing meltdown.\n\nChopra is one of the few Democratic nominees to make it through the Trump administration logjam. Last summer, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recommended Trump fill open Democratic posts at the SEC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with longtime regulator Allison Lee and FDIC veteran Martin Gruenberg. In November, he recommended Graham Steele, a former staffer to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), for another FDIC post. Previous presidents quickly shepherded such recommendations to the Senate, but Trump has yet to formally nominate any of them. He has, however, found time to move ahead with installing a Republican replacement for outgoing Federal Housing Finance Chairman Mel Watt.\n\nIn December, Trump picked Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief economist Mark Calabria for the job. Calabria is a libertarian true-believer who advocates a return to the gold standard and has called to eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing giants he would regulate if confirmed as FHFA chairman. Calabria is scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\n\nLate last month, 20 progressive organizations signed a letter chastising Senate Democrats for inaction on Democratic appointees. By blocking or delaying Republican nominees, the groups wrote, Democrats could pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) into a deal in which the idle Democratic candidates are approved alongside Republicans \u2015 as was customary in previous administrations.\n\nSome of those progressive groups are now specifically calling for Democrats to block the Calabria nomination by placing a hold on it until other Democratic nominees are allowed to come to the floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible,\u201d said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, a net-roots group that focuses on contesting corporate power.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible. David Segal, Demand Progress\n\nIt\u2019s essentially a continuation of last year\u2019s fight between progressives and Schumer over the confirmation of federal judges. At the time, Schumer came under heavy fire for agreeing to confirm large batches of judges by unanimous consent, without securing any Democratic priorities in exchange \u2015 though Schumer (dubiously) argued that letting Democrats go home and campaign without missing votes would help them in the November election. But while Schumer took all of the heat last year, he was acting on behalf of his caucus. Senate Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, were happy to avoid a confrontation.\n\nPrivately, some Democratic staffers continue to insist they have no power. McConnell has final say over confirmation votes, they argue, and if he wants to bring up only Republican nominees, he can. Fighting, the thinking goes, will inevitably result in losing.\n\nBut one aide to a Democratic senator told HuffPost that Calabria\u2019s nomination will not be confirmed by unanimous consent, suggesting that someone \u2015 the aide did not specify who \u2015 will put a hold on the nomination.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats can\u2019t force McConnell or Trump to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. But they can create headaches for them, eating up valuable time on the Senate calendar by demanding that every GOP nomination proceed to a full floor vote. Approving candidates by unanimous consent is faster and leaves the Republican majority with more time to do what it wants to do. McConnell might very well prefer the calendar time to annoying floor fights and bad press from sabotaging the bipartisan nomination process.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-slogan_us_5c63c0d6e4b07115222b5171": "Hillary Clinton had a withering response to President Donald Trump\u2019s repurposing of her old campaign slogan.\n\nTwitter users tittered Monday after the Republican National Committee turned Trump\u2019s \u201cwe\u2019re only getting stronger together\u201d line from his rally in El Paso, Texas, into a graphic.

The 10-9 vote was along party lines, with every Democrat on the committee opposed.\n\nUnder current rules, senators have up to 30 hours to debate a nominee after they have voted to advance the nomination to a final vote \u2015 otherwise known as post-cloture time. Republicans say Democrats are wildly abusing this process to slow the confirmation of many noncontroversial lower court and administrative nominees. They point out that some government agencies are having to run with a bare-bones staff because many of their lower-ranking administrative nominees are still awaiting a confirmation vote.\n\nThe GOP proposal, which was introduced by committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and by James Lankford (R-Okla.), would limit that post-cloture debate time to two hours per nominee \u2015 significantly speeding up the process. It\u2019s similar to a temporary deal on nominations that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) negotiated with Republicans in 2013 \u2015 except the Blunt proposal would change the rules permanently.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to abuse the system like Democrats have been and not expect for people to try to end that abuse,\u201d Blunt told HuffPost last week.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees for lower-level government posts have had an unusually high number of calls for Senate cloture votes to cut off debate and move to the final vote, according to the Pew Research Center. However, Republicans employed the tactic of drawing out debate with equal zeal to slow the confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees after his re-election in 2012, a pattern that led to Reid\u2019s rules change in 2013.\n\nMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the rules committee, said during the markup hearing that Republicans are pursuing the change \u201conly because they want to ram more nominees through.\u201d She noted that part of the reason some government agencies aren\u2019t running at full capacity is that the White House simply hasn\u2019t nominated anyone to the posts.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal; this is not just a minor proposal to come our way,\u201d Klobuchar said on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the proposal was reported favorably out of committee on Wednesday, it will likely fall short of the 60-vote threshold necessary for final passage due to Democratic opposition. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier this week that he would oppose it unless Republicans agree to move the threshold on Supreme Court nominations back up to 60 votes or restore the use of \u201cblue slips\u201d over judicial nominees. Republicans abandoned the long-standing tradition after Trump\u2019s election, a practice that has been followed by both parties for decades and allows senators from a nominee\u2019s state to express their opinion on the individual.\n\nRepublicans suggested on Wednesday that they intend to move forward and pass the new rules proposal unilaterally by going \u201cnuclear\u201d on the Senate floor \u2015 a move that would require only 51 votes for approval.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a top ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said during the hearing.\n\nFew things generate acrimony in the Senate like rules changes \u2015 especially from those who are in the minority. Democrats complained about GOP obstruction on nominations under Obama and eliminated the 60-vote threshold on the president\u2019s picks to appeals courts as a result. When Republicans took power, McConnell subsequently changed the rules on Supreme Court nominations in order to confirm Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said a Republican proposal to change Senate rules and confirm presidential nominees more quickly does not \u201cin any way seriously disadvantage the minority.\u201d\n\nIn the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans have confirmed judicial nominees at a historic pace with scores of conservative new appeals, circuit and district court judges in the federal judiciary. They\u2019ve also succeeded in confirming two of Trump\u2019s picks to the Supreme Court: Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s refusal in 2016 to consider Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, remains a raw issue among many Democrats in the Senate. The blockade of Garland came up, again and again, at the hearing on Wednesday after Republicans complained about \u201crecord\u201d Democratic obstruction in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt was a conscious decision made by the majority leader to deny us the ordinary tradition of filling this vacancy,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told McConnell at one point.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-aclu-lawsuit_n_5c6341a2e4b03de942968362": "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two New Hampshire college students seeking to block a controversial new requirement for voters in the state, saying it imposes an unconstitutional \u201cpoll tax\u201d on voters and makes it disproportionately harder for students to cast a ballot.\n\nIn order to vote in New Hampshire, one needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there \u2015 meaning they have a continued physical presence in the state that they intend to maintain. Being \u201cdomiciled\u201d is legally different from being a \u201cresident.\u201d The state legally defines a resident as someone who intends to remain in the state \u201cfor the indefinite future.\u201d\n\nThe new measure, HB 1264, which is set to take effect on July 1, removes the phrase \u201cfor the indefinite future\u201d from the definition of resident and makes it identical to the definition of domiciled. Thus, anyone claiming to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in order to be eligible to vote is also saying they are a resident and is then obligated to required to get a driver\u2019s license and register their car within 60 days.\n\nThe ACLU says the change is unconstitutional because it imposes a needless and unnecessary burden on college students and others who don\u2019t plan to stay in the state permanently but want to vote there. The civil liberties group says the measure violates the First and 14th amendments because the state hasn\u2019t \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d the law to advance a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nThey also say it violates the 24th Amendment, which prohibits poll taxes, as well as the 26th Amendment, which grants the right to vote to anyone 18 or older.\n\nJulie Ebenstein, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project, noted New Hampshire lawmakers had been trying for decades to impose similar restrictions on college students\u2019 ability to vote. In 1972, a three-judge panel said a law that barred people who planned to leave a New Hampshire town at some point in the future from voting was unconstitutional. In 2014, a state court struck down a law that explicitly required anyone who registered to vote in New Hampshire to get a state driver\u2019s license and to get their vehicle registered there. That decision was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans passed HB 1264 shortly after Democrat Maggie Hassan defeated Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes for one of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seats in 2016. In the same year, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump in the state. Ebenstein noted the bill passed along party lines in the legislature and that lawmakers appeared to be targeting young voters and college students based on a perception that they supported Democrats.\n\n\u201cCollege students are perceived by legislators as being more liberal or being more left and we know that because the legislators said so. ... Given legislators\u2019 perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe 2016 election was very close in New Hampshire.\u201d She added that because of the state\u2019s small population the 13,000 undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire can make a difference in a close election.\n\nGiven legislators' perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted. Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney, ACLU Voting Rights Project\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, are Caroline Casey and Maggie Flaherty, two sophomores at Dartmouth College who are registered to vote in New Hampshire despite growing up outside the state. Both voted in the 2018 midterm elections there. Neither woman has a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and both intend to leave the state after graduating from college. Neither has a car and said in the complaint filed Wednesday that traveling to the nearest Division of Motor Vehicles would be a burden to them.\n\nIn a July op-ed justifying the law, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) wrote that people can vote in New Hampshire without satisfying the obligations of residents. The new law, he said, would put everyone on \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\nIn an advisory opinion last year, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found 3-2 that the new measure did not violate either the New Hampshire Constitution or the First or 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the law did not amount to a poll tax nor did it target young voters.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the State may legitimately establish procedures by which persons who may be tempted to insincerely claim domicile for voting purposes are discouraged from doing so by the prospect that such a claim can result in their incurring the full panoply of obligations imposed on all other state residents,\u201d the majority wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that states may not condition the right to vote on the payment of a tax or fee,\u201d they continued. \u201cHowever, the opponents of HB 1264 are mistaken when they claim that the bill conditions voting on the payment of motor vehicle fees or taxes. Rather, if a person becomes obligated to pay such fees or taxes, it will not be because the person votes, but because the person owns or drives a motor vehicle and is a resident of this state. Thus, a person who claims domicile in New Hampshire for voting purposes but who does not drive or own a motor vehicle will have no obligation to pay motor vehicle related fees.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images The ACLU is suing New Hampshire over a change in the legal definition of \"resident.\" The change is set to go into effect later this year.\n\nBut Ebenstein said the two students in the case had already shown they were legitimate New Hampshire voters. The state, she said, was essentially adding an additional hurdle for the students to prove they were bona fide residents.\n\n\u201cOur clients, who moved to New Hampshire, been active on campus, been active in their communities, who have already participated in the political process in New Hampshire are fully committed to their state and their role in the local community and certainly do to New Hampshire play a large role in the political conversation and process. That\u2019s most likely why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with ensuring someone\u2019s eligibility. It\u2019s just once they are eligible, the state can\u2019t put barriers in the way of letting them exercise that right,\u201d she added. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to prove their devotion to New Hampshire by paying fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sununu expressed confidence the law would be upheld:\n\nThis lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate attempt to dredge up arguments that our State Supreme Court already rejected last summer. The Supreme Court addressed each of the legal arguments made by opponents of House Bill 1264 and found that the law ensures that every voter is treated the same. I fully expect our federal court to reach the same conclusion. Given that House Bill 1264 does nothing more than align New Hampshire with virtually every other state in requiring residency in order to vote, the plaintiffs in this suit should be asked whether they plan to file identical lawsuits in every other state.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Sununu.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-collins-kavanaugh-abortion_us_5c630f39e4b0b50014aa81fc": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) defended her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday despite his vote in favor of an anti-abortion law in Louisiana last week.\n\nKavanaugh joined three other conservative justices in dissenting to a Supreme Court order that blocked an anti-abortion Louisiana law from going into effect; the law required doctors performing abortions to have the authority to admit patients to nearby hospitals.\n\nOpponents of that requirement say that it would have dramaticaly reduced eligible doctors, leaving the state just one physician to perform abortions. The law is virtually identical to a Texas anti-abortion law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 with the help of former Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was succeeded by Kavanaugh last year.\n\nProgressive advocacy groups are furious that Collins, who says she supports abortion rights, voted in favor of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. They say his decision to greenlight a law that would limit access to abortion only confirms their fears that he presents a long-term threat to Roe v. Wade, the major abortion rights precedent. Over the weekend, advocacy group Demand Justice aired digital ads in Maine slamming Collins for her Kavanaugh support.\n\nCollins insisted on Tuesday that Kavanaugh won\u2019t overturn Roe despite his anti-abortion vote last week, however. The senator argued that the justice took a \u201clogical approach\u201d in his dissent to the case and said she did not believe he contradicted precedents established by Roe and Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, which held that states can\u2019t place undue burdens on women seeking an abortion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how this is being viewed as somehow overturning Roe v. Wade except by people on the far left who are looking for anything,\u201d Collins told HuffPost on Tuesday.\n\nIn his dissent to the order, which he wrote separately from the other conservatives on the court, Kavanaugh argued the issue hinged on whether the doctors who perform abortions at the state\u2019s clinics can obtain admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they provide abortion care. Abortion providers in the state said that the Louisiana law would severely curtail access to abortions because of the requirement to the point where many clinics would be forced to close forever. Kavanaugh, however, argued that the state had sufficient time to resolve the matter of admitting privileges before the law took effect. If the doctors cannot obtain admitting privileges, he added, they can return to court.\n\n\u201cWhat he is simply saying is that if during that period of time the physicians do not get their privileges, they can come back to the court without prejudice. I think that was a logical approach, and he committed to following the precedent that was established in Whole Woman\u2019s Health,\u201d Collins added.\n\nShe has proven time and time again that she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not the millions of women who are asking her to give us the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut pro-choice advocates aren\u2019t letting Collins off the hook for her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Collins\u2019 defense of his vote \u201cabsurd.\u201d She said that requiring doctors to hold admitting privileges in local hospitals was already ruled as an undue burden by the Supreme Court in the Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision.\n\n\u201cShe has proven time and time again that she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not the millions of women who are asking her to give us the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Hogue told HuffPost on Tuesday, adding that Collins\u2019 continued support of Kavanaugh goes \u201cagainst all logic based on what we\u2019re seeing\u201d about the justice\u2019s rulings on the court.\n\nWhile Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four more liberal justices in blocking the Louisiana law from going into effect, it\u2019s probably not the final say the court will get on the matter. According to SCOTUSblog, the petitioners in the case are likely to seek further review, leading to possible oral arguments in the fall of 2019 or winter of 2020, with a decision that could come by the end of June 2020 \u2015 smack dab in the middle of the presidential campaign.\n\nCollins also faces a heated re-election fight in 2020. While her standing with Republican voters in Maine improved in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, she\u2019s likely to face a strong challenge in the general election.\n\nGOP senators who supported Kavanaugh will have to answer for their vote in coming months, Hogue said on Tuesday, adding that voters view threats to abortion as \u201cincreasingly real and material.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-first-black-woman-chief-justice-supreme-court-cheri-beasley_n_5c644ed2e4b07115222c717c": "North Carolina Gov.

Barr said he believed Mueller\u2019s report would be \u201cconfidential,\u201d but that as attorney general he would issue a public summary of its findings.\n\nBarr also said he believed that the attorney general had some \u201cflexibility and discretion\u201d about what he could disclose to the public after the Mueller investigation concluded.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images\n\nA section of the regulations for special counsels says that, at the end of a probe, the counsel\u2019s office \u201cshall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by\u201d investigators. The regulations also state that the attorney general \u201cmay determine that public release of these reports would be in the public interest, to the extent that release would comply with applicable legal restrictions.\u201d\n\nBarr said his \u201cobjective and goal\u201d would be to push for as much transparency as he could.\n\n\u201cAll I can say at this stage... is that I\u2019m going to try to get the information out there, consistent with these regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nBarr said he\u2019d likely make public any conclusions by the Mueller investigation, adding that it was hard \u201cto conceive of a conclusion that would run afoul of the regs as currently written.\u201d\n\nBarr also testified that he would not carry out any order from the president to fire Mueller without good cause and that he was \u201cnot going to be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong.\u201d If someone tried to stop a bonafide federal investigation in order to cover up wrongdoing, Barr said, \u201cI would resign.\u201d\n\nBarr struggled to imagine a scenario in which Mueller, a longtime friend, would take an action that could lead to termination.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a special counsel removed since Archibald Cox,\u201d Barr said, referring to President Richard Nixon\u2019s firing of the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear when Mueller will issue a final report, but indications are that his investigation will be wrapping up in the coming months. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is expected to depart the Justice Department after Barr\u2019s anticipated confirmation, and as attorney general he would oversee the investigation unless he recuses himself.\n\nBarr would not commit to following the recommendations of career ethics officials about whether he might need to recuse himself but said he would consult with the officials.\n\nThe man Barr would replace as head of the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions, quickly recused himself from overseeing the Russia probe because he played a direct role in helping Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. But Sessions\u2019 recusal \u2015 approved by ethics watchdogs \u2015 caused Trump to continually berate him and played a major role in his departure from the administration.\n\nBarr\u2019s confirmation, with Republicans in control of the Senate, appears a foregone conclusion. His Tuesday comments also may have eased some of the concerns Democratic senators have raised about him serving as attorney general. But several commentators said they did not think his commitments concerning the Russia probe went far enough.\n\nNan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, said Barr \u201cdid nothing today to allay fears that he would be an attorney general who would enable President Trump to continue his abuse of executive authority.\u201d\n\nKevin McAlister of Law Works said Barr \u201cleft himself too much wiggle room to allow him to decline to release the special counsel\u2019s full findings to Congress and the American people for everyone to read.\u201d\n\nBarr, 68, told senators he was hesitant to take the attorney general\u2019s job and that he had been looking forward to spending time with his family after a long legal career.

Martha McSally in 2020. He\u2019s a dream candidate: a naval aviator-turned-astronaut who\u2019s made four trips to space, the husband of a Democratic Party star who survived an assassination attempt, a gun control advocate who\u2019s helped a nationwide network of candidates and built a matching network of donors.\n\nHowever, the party\u2019s left wing is holding off on the celebrations for now. Public records show Kelly voted in the 2012 GOP primary while living in Texas, meaning he likely cast a ballot for either Mitt Romney or one of the host of conservatives running against President Barack Obama and either Ted Cruz or David Dewhurst for Senate. (A Kelly spokesperson said he voted for Obama in the general election.)\n\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images Mark Kelly, a gun control advocate, former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, will be a top Democratic contender for Arizona's Senate seat.\n\nAnd progressives both in the state and nationally have long been preparing for Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino veteran of the war in Afghanistan and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to run for the seat. Gallego is still considering a bid, potentially creating an ideological clash with Kelly. It\u2019s one of a host of potentially pugnacious primaries Democrats could face in 2020 as they seek to win back control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Gallego wrote on Twitter Tuesday, the day Kelly announced his campaign. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon. #AZSEN \u2014 Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) February 12, 2019\n\nA Democratic source said Gallego\u2019s chief of staff, David Montes, a veteran of former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid\u2019s office, has been taking meetings with media consultants and pollsters in recent weeks to prepare for a potential bid. Gallego isn\u2019t 100 percent certain to run; his team is still investigating whether it could raise the cash necessary to challenge Kelly in a primary.\n\nMcSally, a moderate-turned-Trump ally who narrowly lost the U.S. Senate race to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in November and was appointed to the seat formerly held by the late John McCain in December, is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot in 2020.\n\nA primary battle between Gallego, 39, and Kelly, 54, could be one of several such contests Senate Democrats face this cycle. While it\u2019s still early in the recruiting process \u2015 Arizona\u2019s primary won\u2019t be until August 2020 \u2015 there\u2019s also the potential for intraparty clashes to determine who will face incumbent Republicans in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. Races in those five GOP-held states, along with the Democrats\u2019 defense of seats in Alabama, Michigan and New Hampshire, are likely to determine which party controls the Senate in 2021. (Democrats are also likely to look at redder territory, including Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and Texas.)\n\nIn Colorado, a host of Democrats are likely to compete for the right to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. Two Democrats who have run for statewide office in the past \u2015 former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff and former state Sen. Mike Johnston \u2015 have already entered the race, and another former state House Speaker, Crisanta Duran, is also considering a challenge to Gardner.\n\nIn both Georgia and North Carolina, Democrats are focused on wooing candidates who could clear the field: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s pursuit of former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to run against Sen. David Perdue is no secret, and Democrats are eyeing Attorney General Josh Stein in North Carolina as a challenger to Sen. Thom Tillis. But if either candidate opts against the run, the field would be wide open. In Iowa and Maine, no consensus candidate has emerged but operatives believe women would be best to challenge Sens. Joni Ernst and Susan Collins.\n\nThe Next Mission For An Undefined Candidate\n\nKelly\u2019s strengths are readily apparent. As the leader of Giffords, the gun control group named for his wife, shooting victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), he\u2019s become a high-profile advocate on a key issue for the Democratic base and played a major role in raising and spending more than $17 million for candidates across the country last cycle.\n\nHis introductory video, however, makes little mention of his gun control work, instead focusing on the rest of his biography: The son of a woman who became one of the first female police officers in the 1970s, he joined the Navy, flew combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and become an astronaut alongside his twin brother. He then left NASA to help Giffords with her recovery.\n\nThe sterling biography, however, hides a candidate who is still ideologically undefined. In the launch video, Kelly makes his opposition to gerrymandering and refusal to take corporate PAC money clear, but how he would solve other problems mentioned in the video \u2015 high health care costs, wage stagnation \u2015 is left unsaid. As one Gallego ally, granted anonymity to speak about Kelly\u2019s weaknesses, said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know a lot about Mark.\u201d\n\nKelly does take a firm stance on his belief in man-made climate change. 314 Action, a group that backs scientists for office, cited that as a reason to quickly endorse him. \u201cVery few people have had the type of view Mark has of the damage climate change has done to our planet,\u201d said Josh Morrow, the group\u2019s executive director, referring to Kelly\u2019s time in outer space.\n\nKelly\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t make him available for an interview, but he told the Arizona Republic he sees himself as someone who\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d and is \u201cnot going to look at these issues through a partisan lens.\u201d Sinema, who is now seen as one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, used similar rhetoric during her 2018 win over McSally.\n\nAnd his vote in the 2012 GOP primary is easy fodder for a Democratic rival. Kelly\u2019s campaign said the candidate didn\u2019t remember whom he voted for in either the presidential or Senate primaries that year.\n\n\u201cMark was an independent at the time, and because President Obama was uncontested, Mark voted in the Republican primary,\u201d said Jacob Peters, Kelly\u2019s communications director. \u201cHe proudly voted for President Obama in the general.\u201d\n\nGallego\u2019s Uphill Battle\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Progressives don't have a great record in recent Senate primaries. Rep. Ruben Gallego will try to change that.\n\nFor Gallego to defeat Kelly would be a reversal of a long-standing political trend. Essentially, no progressive Democrat has triumphed in a contested Senate primary for a GOP-held seat since former Rep. Joe Sestak ousted party-switching Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010. Since then, DSCC-endorsed candidates have squashed candidates like now-Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and former Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.\n\nSchumer has worked assiduously over the years to avoid high-profile primaries in states where Democrats are looking to win GOP-held seats. The Senate Democratic leader has largely been successful, defeating a smattering of left-wing candidates. In the past two election cycles, only two Democratic primaries in targeted Senate seats \u2015 Katie McGinty\u2019s 2016 victory in Pennsylvania and Patty Judge\u2019s win in Iowa the same year \u2015 were decided by fewer than 38 percentage points. (Both women eventually lost to incumbent Republicans.)\n\nThe Harvard-educated Gallego, who supports Medicare for All, marijuana legalization and a $15 minimum wage, would be the first Latino to represent Arizona in the Senate. A successful primary campaign would depend on his ability to craft a coalition of Latino voters and progressives. The ability to unite the party\u2019s liberal base with minority voters has been elusive for progressives in Senate races \u2015 endorsements by Obama helped deliver black voters to the establishment candidates in Florida\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate races in 2016.\n\nBut Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, has already teamed up with Latino Victory Fund to launch a digital campaign encouraging Gallego to run.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-green-new-deal_n_5c649e36e4b0aec93d3afa91": "Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images Sen.

On Wednesday, the group rallied more than 80 protesters outside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s New York office, calling on the Democrat to support the resolution.\n\nBut unlike health care, taxes and other policies with clear ideological battle lines, Republicans \u2015 no longer able to deny the science behind climate change outright as a large majority of Americans understand its realities \u2015 are struggling to articulate an alternative vision of how to prepare for an increasingly frightening, hot future. In the Sunrise Movement\u2019s view, the Green New Deal\u2019s momentum will take more cynical political ploys.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when McConnell will schedule the vote, but it could come as early as next month.\n\nThe Senate leader\u2019s announcement followed days of Republican attacks on the Green New Deal that ranged from traditional critiques of a big-government policy approach to wild-eyed tirades filled with blatant misinformation about the resolution itself.\n\nMichael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Sunrise Movement activists staged protests in November in then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez released a sweeping resolution last Thursday staking out the core tenets of a policy that aims to keep global warming from reaching cataclysmic levels, prepare the nation\u2019s infrastructure for the climate change already occurring and expand the social safety net for communities plagued by existing pollution. The measure calls for generating as close to 100 percent of the United States\u2019 electricity as possible from renewables over the next decade and ramping up manufacturing of clean-energy technologies, electric vehicles and public transit.\n\nRepublicans began attacking the policy before the resolution even came out.\n\nLast Wednesday, the day before the resolution\u2019s release, House Republicans referred to the general concept of a Green New Deal as a \u201cwealth transfer scheme\u201d and a \u201cradical policy.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday night, Fox News pundit Sean Hannity launched into a furious, minutes-long rant in which he called the Green New Deal \u201ca real, serious threat to our way of life\u201d and a \u201cdangerous idea\u201d without once describing the actual proposal. By Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that a Green New Deal would \u201cpermanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell is going to regret this sorry attempt to stop the Green New Deal. Varshini Prakash, Sunrise Movement executive director\n\nPartially fueling the attacks is a memo Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released last week with the resolution. The memo, described as an FAQ, contradicted the resolution by taking positions on nuclear energy, agricultural emissions and carbon-capture technology that didn\u2019t appear in the official legislation.\n\nBy sanctioning a vote, McConnell appears to be betting the mudslinging will make the resolution too radioactive to pass with a majority of Democrats, let alone any Republicans.\n\nThe policy polls strongly with voters. In December, 81 percent of registered voters supported the goals of the Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans, according to a poll from Yale and George Mason universities.

On Jan. 18, BuzzFeed News published a report alleging that Trump had ordered his fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about their efforts during the 2016 presidential campaign to secure Russian government approval to build a Trump Tower Moscow.\n\nCongressional Democrats pounced on the allegation that the president had suborned perjury. It was evidence of \u201cobstruction of justice,\u201d a \u201chigh crime\u201d and an impeachable offense, Democrats tweeted. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) promised to investigate.\n\nThen, special counsel Robert Mueller disputed the report. (BuzzFeed stands by its reporting.)\n\nMueller\u2019s intervention doused the latest excitement. But Democrats\u2019 rapid-fire response revealed that they sense they\u2019re heading toward an inevitable reckoning with this president.\n\n\u201cEvery day it becomes more and more difficult to say we\u2019re not interested in impeachment,\u201d said one Democratic member of Congress.\n\nPutting aside the disputed allegations in the BuzzFeed story, there are already more than a handful of potential areas of inquiry that carry the hallmarks of impeachable offenses. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey to relieve the \u201cgreat pressure\u201d of the investigation into whether his campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election. Before that, he asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to intervene to stop the FBI investigation. Trump has also been named as the \u201cIndividual-1\u201d in a criminal plea agreement who ordered Cohen to break campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cAt some point it\u2019s like if this guy did this bad stuff, he needs to be impeached and we need to do it \u2015 even if there\u2019s a political cost to it,\u201d the Democratic member of Congress said.\n\n\u2018Numerous Allegations Of Corruption And Obstruction\u2019\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the new chair of the House Judiciary Committee, hired two investigators who have previously argued that Trump may have already committed impeachable offenses.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, the first stop for impeachment discussions, made its first real step toward investigating potentially impeachable actions committed by the president on Tuesday. Nadler, the new chairman, announced that he\u2019d hired two legal consultants: Norm Eisen, the former Obama administration ethics czar and chairman of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and Barry Berke, a top-flight white collar defense attorney. Eisen and Berke are both esteemed investigators who have publicly argued that Trump\u2019s actions may already constitute impeachable offenses.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time in our Nation\u2019s history,\u201d Nadler said in a statement announcing the hires. \u201cThe President of the United States faces numerous allegations of corruption and obstruction. His conduct and crude statements threaten the basic legal, ethical, and constitutional norms that maintain our democratic institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House Judiciary Committee is determined to ask critical questions, gather all the information, judiciously assess the evidence, and make sure that the facts are not hidden from the American people,\u201d the chairman added.\n\nNadler\u2019s sober statement reflects the tone that Democratic leadership in Congress would like to project as they begin the methodical effort to build a public case. The understanding among most Democratic lawmakers is that impeachment is a constitutional tool that should only be used on the rare occasion when a president\u2019s acts undermine the rule of law, threaten the liberty of American citizens or attack the integrity of the American government. The acts that could constitute impeachable offenses may include actual crimes, but are not limited to criminal acts.\n\nMany Democrats believe that this standard requires a yet-to-be-disclosed major revelation \u2015 like the obstruction of justice alleged by the BuzzFeed report \u2015 to tip the current situation into impeachment territory. Nadler\u2019s new hires show that he will begin to build a public record while waiting to see if Mueller or anyone else drops the anticipated bombshell.\n\n\u2018Our Elected Officials Haven\u2019t Done Anything\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Billionaire Tom Steyer plans to spend as much as $90 million to advocate for Trump's impeachment.\n\nNot everyone is so patient. Ten days after the BuzzFeed report, hundreds of activists from around the country descended on Washington to urge their elected representatives to impeach the president \u2015 now.\n\nThe conference was hosted by Need to Impeach, an organization launched by billionaire investor Tom Steyer in 2018. Steyer has already gotten 7.1 million Americans to sign a petition calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. He is promising to spend up to $90 million on an advertising and grassroots campaign to pressure Congress to impeach Trump. The former hedge fund manager talked about running for president in 2020, but decided against it after looking at the polling. Instead, he is focused on raising a grassroots army to get Congress to oust Trump before the next election.\n\nSteyer told the 300-some conference attendees that those in favor of impeachment have \u201cwon the argument,\u201d but are losing the public relations battle.\n\n\u201cOur debating team got an \u2018A,\u2019 but in the schoolyard we\u2019re still getting our ass kicked,\u201d he said.\n\nThis man is the crisis in our country. I don\u2019t know why our elected officials haven\u2019t done anything. And I'm really angry. Rita Fox, a Need to Impeach activist\n\nRita Fox, a 63-year-old retired veteran, came to Washington from the Tampa Bay, Florida, area to lobby her congressman, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), to support impeachment.\n\nFox had seen an ad for Steyer\u2019s organization on CNN one day and went online to sign the group\u2019s petition. She went to see him speak in St. Petersburg in September and got further involved with Need to Impeach by organizing her friends to write letters and make phone calls to elect a Democratic House majority in the 2018 elections. In January, she joined Need to Impeach\u2019s push in Washington.\n\n\u201cThis man is the crisis in our country,\u201d Fox said of the president. \u201cI don\u2019t know why our elected officials haven\u2019t done anything. And I\u2019m really angry. I think I\u2019m more angry at them because they alone have the power to do it legally. And I\u2019m just not seeing it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Congress Is Just Getting Started\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Richard Nixon leaves the White House on Aug. 9, 1974, after resigning office to avoid being impeached.\n\nA handful of House Democrats have already signaled a willingness to begin impeachment proceedings. In the previous Congress, Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) introduced two resolutions calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment that focused on the president\u2019s defense of neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, his retweeting of anti-Muslim hate videos and other bigoted statements he\u2019s made. These are not what have traditionally been considered impeachable offenses.\n\nThe House voted to table both of Green\u2019s resolutions. But the number of members who voted to debate them increased from 58 in 2017 to 66 in 2018.\n\nThis year, Green co-sponsored articles of impeachment introduced by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.). These articles are specifically tailored to Trump\u2019s actions in removing Comey in an effort to quash the investigation into his campaign \u2015 an act that comes closer to the impeachable offenses approved by the House Judiciary Committee in Nixon\u2019s case. It is almost certain that this resolution will not be used if Democratic leaders choose to move forward with impeachment.\n\nTrump\u2019s alleged high crimes mirror Nixon\u2019s, former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman (D-N.Y.) told the Need to Impeach conference in January. Holtzman served on the House Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach Nixon.\n\nMueller is way down the road. Congress is just getting started. I\u2019d like Congress to get way down the road, too. Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswoman who voted to impeach Nixon\n\nConsider the parallels: Nixon ordered the CIA to stop the FBI from investigating the Watergate break-in. Trump told Coats to get Comey to stop the Russia investigation. Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the Saturday Night Massacre. Trump fired Comey and then he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions because he felt Sessions had not done enough to stop the investigation. Nixon ordered his chief of staff H.R. Haldeman to lie to Congress. That is what the disputed BuzzFeed story alleges Trump did with Cohen. Nixon dangled pardons in front of the Watergate burglars to keep them quiet.

The probe resulted in the arrests of 18 Saudis, including 15 operatives who had allegedly acted as the hit squad. Saudi Arabia has vehemently denied MBS played a role in the murder.\n\nBut Barrack, like his longtime friend Trump, apparently rejected the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s determination that MBS had directed Khashoggi\u2019s assassination.

I have always believed and continue to believe that the United States is the greatest country in the world but our history and our policies in the Middle East have been confusing at times.

Rosenstein, who had written a memo supporting the dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey based on the premise that Comey had treated Hillary Clinton unfairly during the 2016 campaign, had more recently clashed with Trump after reports he made comments about overthrowing Trump or secretly recording him shortly before Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nA person familiar with Rosenstein\u2019s thinking told HuffPost that there\u2019s currently no concrete, specific plan in place for Rosenstein\u2019s resignation but said he\u2019s expecting to depart after Barr\u2019s confirmation. Rosenstein, the person said, was not being forced out and had always thought he would be in the high-octane position of deputy attorney general for about two years.\n\nBarr\u2019s confirmation as attorney general \u2015 a position currently occupied on an acting basis by Matthew Whitaker following the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions \u2015 would ensure a smooth transition, the person said.

That could leave the decision in the hands of Barr, who has expansive views of executive power and wrote an unsolicited memo to Rosenstein in June 2018 knocking Mueller for probing whether the president\u2019s firing of Comey was obstruction of justice.\n\nBarr, now 68, served as the 77th attorney general during George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration, assuming the position at the age of 41. Barr, a conservative steeped in the law-and-order politics of the early \u201990s, began meeting with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ahead of his confirmation hearing scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters that Barr talked to him about his relationship with Mueller, including the fact that their wives are in a Bible study group together and Mueller has attended two of Barr\u2019s daughters\u2019 weddings. Barr, Graham said, told him he didn\u2019t think Mueller was on a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d as Trump has branded the Mueller probe. Barr said he would go through the process of determining whether the Mueller report could be shared with Congress and the public when the report is finished, according to Graham.\n\nThe expected departure of Rosenstein, who had previously enjoyed bipartisan support and was kept in his role as Maryland\u2019s top federal prosecutor during the Obama administration, has heightened Democratic concerns ahead of the Barr hearing.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who had backed legislation to protect the Mueller probe, said Rosenstein\u2019s presence at DOJ \u201chas been reassuring to many of us who are concerned about the independence of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d Coons said in a statement that it was \u201ccritical\u201d that Barr \u201cmake clear during his hearing that he is committed to the rule of law and that he will not allow President Trump to interfere with the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nSen.

The Democrat from New York held her first press conference Wednesday since announcing her presidential exploratory committee. As if on cue, after she finished her speech at the event in Troy, New York, she was right off the bat asked about likability.\n\nA male reporter essentially told Gillibrand she was nice. Then, he wondered if being nice would be a selling point in the 2020 presidential election considering that Trump \u2015 widely understood as not nice \u2015 would be the competition.

Since Clinton was perceived to be unlikable, every other woman running for president \u2015 no matter how different they are from her \u2015 is now being compared to her on this measure.\n\nThis is a core part of the tightrope women must walk when running for office, particularly president.

Twenty-two of the 63 federal charges he now faces are punishable by death.\n\nThe shooting is now considered the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. For many American Jews like me, it represented a declaration of a new normal.\n\nFor decades, \u201cthe breadth of acceptance accorded U.S. Jews was indeed exceptional, probably unique,\u201d explained David Berger, dean of the Bernard Revel Graduate School at Yeshiva University. For many people, the Pittsburgh killings were the latest sign that acceptance was starting to fade, triggering fears that the United States, an inspirational refuge for so many American Jews\u2019 grandparents and great-grandparents, could no longer protect us.\n\nAnd so, increasingly and across the country, American Jews are taking steps to protect ourselves.\n\nWithin hours of the shooting in Pittsburgh, Secure Community Network, a nonprofit partner of the Jewish Federations of North America that responds to incidents and provides security assessments to synagogues and other Jewish institutions, arrived on scene to assist authorities. Centralized synagogue movements fielded hundreds of calls from anxious congregational leaders. Within two months of the shooting, Community Security Service, a nonprofit collaboration of former military and security professionals that trains Jewish volunteers to protect their institutions, recorded an 150 percent increase in volunteers going through its training. Nearly 1,000 American Jewish people attended basic security concepts programs in multiple states, according to Jason Friedman, the executive director of CSS.\n\nEven gun use, once a backburner topic quietly discussed in the private confines of rabbis\u2019 offices, is now something widely debated in the American Jewish community.\n\nHow We Got Here\n\nJewish people have been persecuted for millennia. But anti-Semitic incidents in the United States have increased dramatically in recent years. And as life has become more dangerous for Jewish Americans over the last decade \u2015 especially in the two years since Donald Trump was elected president \u2015 synagogues and other Jewish establishments have struggled to define what \u201cpreparedness\u201d should look like.\n\nIn 2006, I worked at Gratz College, a school of Jewish studies outside Philadelphia whose open campus housed several Jewish agencies, including a day school. Impressively unqualified, and inspired by a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\u2019 report that called anti-Semitic incidents a \u201cserious problem\u201d on college campuses throughout the nation, I declared myself Gratz\u2019s director of institutional security, attended training with the Philadelphia anti-terrorism chief, and put in place some new security features, including a video surveillance system.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember now, but at the time, just half a decade after the 9/11 attacks, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d was more often than not a euphemism for a very specific type of violence \u2014 the al Qaeda and al Qaeda-inspired kind. At the time, Jewish organizations, and most Americans, weren\u2019t particularly focused on the threat of wannabe Nazis and other domestic terrorists.\n\nThe election of Barack Obama changed all that. White supremacists, enraged and threatened by the emergence of the first black president, revived a disingenuous, if not quite buried, decades-old narrative: Jews, immigrants of color and minorities would take the country from a helpless white majority. By 2012, anti-Semitic incidents perpetuated by neo-Nazis, skinheads, white supremacists and white nationalist sympathizers outpaced those of decentralized jihadis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, 2017.\n\nThen Trump ran \u2014 and won, with the Republican Party running an anti-Semitic ad as part of his closing message. Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise when he said there \u201cwere very fine people on both sides\u201d of a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman was killed while protesting against racism.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the president of the United States had poured rocket fuel onto simmering, anti-Semitic embers. Trump\u2019s words normalized the white men marching through the streets with tiki torches, chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d\n\nIncidents against the Jewish community increased 57 percent from 2016 to 2017, the largest uptick in 20 years and the largest single-year increase in history, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n\u201cRising anger within the right-wing community is, right now, greater that it was, let\u2019s say, a decade ago,\u201d said David Friedman, the vice president of law enforcement and community security at the ADL. \u201cAnd since Jews are and Jewish institutions are one of the things that the right-wing focuses on, they consider Jews to have a particularly significant role in what they regard [as] \u2014 and they used this expression in Charlottesville \u2014 \u2018taking away their country.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow American Jews Have Responded\n\nAmerican Jewish institutions have responded to the rising threat of anti-Semitism in different ways.

Cory Booker\u2019s favorite presidential campaign-trail yarn \u2015 and he has a lot of them \u2015 is about how his parents, two of IBM\u2019s first black executives, overcame housing market discrimination to raise him and his brother in a predominantly white neighborhood in one of his state\u2019s suburbs.\n\n\n\nAs an adult, Booker likes to recall, he asked Arthur Lessman, the white lawyer who helped his parents outsmart a racist real estate agent, why the attorney was inspired to do it. It turned out that Lessman had volunteered his services after watching television one day in 1965 when the normal programming was interrupted by breaking footage of Alabama state troopers brutally bludgeoning black civil rights activists marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.\n\n\n\nRecounting the tale Friday afternoon to an audience of about 100 Democrats at a community college in Waterloo, Booker marveled at the far-reaching power of individual political sacrifices. It\u2019s a testament, he declared with excitement in his voice, to his deeply held belief that \u201clove is a radical force.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe marchers in Selma \u201cstood up for love of country and unleashed that energy and it instantaneously leapt a thousand miles and changed the heart of one man on a couch in New Jersey, who then would go on and change generations not yet born,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here right now because of that chain reaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same weekend that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to \u201cfight back\u201d against the \u201cclass warfare\u201d waged by the super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort.\n\n\n\nRather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy \u2015 an \u201cus\u201d against a proverbial \u201cthem\u201d \u2015 Booker focuses almost entirely on the \u201cus\u201d \u2015 on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement.\n\n\n\nBooker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States\u2019 forefathers \u201cimperfect geniuses\u201d for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not.\n\nI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it. Tom Swartz, former Iowa state representative, referring to Booker\n\nIn this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman\u2019s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism.\n\n\u201cIf we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,\u201d he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Booker\u2019s appeals to America\u2019s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders\u2019 work of forming a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama\u2019s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job.\n\nOn Booker\u2019s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it,\u201d said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown.\n\nAfter the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren\u2019s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.)\n\nBut Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump\u2019s invective.\n\n\u201cIt probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,\u201d Blaisdell said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Charlie Neibergall Booker minged with voters at the First Congregational United Church of Christ on Friday in Mason City, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I Had To Run Something\u2019\n\nBooker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders \u2015 which includes several of his Senate colleagues.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs.\n\nBooker, whose mother\u2019s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party\u2019s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cMy story is your story,\u201d he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class.\n\nBooker tells story of his Iowa roots.

On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a \u201cSpartacus moment,\u201d a reference that left observers quizzical.\n\nRegardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI had to run something,\u201d Booker said in Marshalltown. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nThe experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate.\n\nBooker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing.\n\nGrassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country\u2019s system of law enforcement and incarceration.\n\nRather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\u201cSome people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. \u201cWell, I ran a fire department. That\u2019s not going to be a constructive strategy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Susan Walsh Booker cajoles Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to join him in an Instagram Live post in December. Looking on is Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nShrugging Off Criticism From The Left\n\nOf course, Booker\u2019s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term \u201cWall Street\u201d \u2015 a favorite target of attack among his party\u2019s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.)\n\nIn his efforts to improve Newark\u2019s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good.\n\nBooker\u2019s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies.\n\nIn addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago.\n\nBooker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations.\n\nIn Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools.\n\nTime and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities.\n\nRather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor.\n\n\u201cI was like Malcolm X \u2014 by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,\u201d he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening.\n\nAt the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren.\n\nHe admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high. But rather than lower it to 21 percent from 35 percent, as the GOP measure did, he would have left it at 25 or 26 percent.\n\nAnd in a conversation that night about climate policy in Iowa City, he described nuclear energy as part of the solution.\n\nMore on climate change: He supports nuclear energy and thinks any climate bill must be bipartisan (unless there\u2019s a 60-vote Senate due to \u201cblue tsunami\u201d). This is at supporter\u2019s home in Iowa City. pic.twitter.com/GkkUZVa4E2 \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nBooker was keen to emphasize that action on what he sees as the country\u2019s most urgent priorities \u2015 such as universal health coverage and addressing climate change \u2015 would require either compromise with Republicans or a \u201cblue tsunami\u201d big enough to grant Democrats a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.\n\nBooker is a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation, which would replace private health insurance with a federal single-payer program. But on two occasions in Iowa, he suggested that the bill is an aspiration unlikely to be realized in the near future, given the constraints of GOP numbers in the Senate.\n\nSingle-payer health care \u201cis a goal we should shoot at,\u201d he told a crowd of 500 people at Kum & Go Theater in Des Moines on Saturday.\n\nIn the interim, he proposed backing a Medicare buy-in or lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age to 55 or 50.\n\nWhat Booker did not volunteer in his discussion is that he not only opposes efforts to abolish the filibuster in the Senate, he has promised to personally defend the practice if it came under assault.\n\nStill, many of the Democrats who attended Booker\u2019s events seemed either unaware of Booker\u2019s deviations from progressive orthodoxy or relatively unbothered by it after hearing him speak.\n\nShawn Harmsen, a 46-year-old journalism professor, hosted a campaign gathering for Booker at his home in Iowa City, where he prominently displayed a blue \u201cI [heart] public educators\u201d sign on his front lawn.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) asked Whitaker whether he was involved in the January decision of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to alter an established legal interpretation of the Federal Wire Act in order to further limit online gambling and whether he had any communications with Adelson or any of the billionaire\u2019s lobbyists. The new opinion reversed a 2011 OLC interpretation of the act that had applied a prohibition on online gambling strictly to online betting on sports. State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.\n\nWhitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson.\n\n\u201cYour inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,\u201d the acting attorney general said.\n\nRaskin was not satisfied with Whitaker\u2019s answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThis definitely bears further investigation,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWhen and where and by whom remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Jamie Raskin questions acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker at a congressional hearing on Feb. 8, 2019.\n\nThe investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLC\u2019s sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.\n\nSheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.\n\nMore recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.\n\nThe revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNow some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should \u201cwithdraw its opinion\u201d because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.\n\nBesides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senate\u2019s confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trump\u2019s choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sheldon Adelson attends a White House ceremony to see his wife, Miriam, receive the Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in November 2018.\n\nSince 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation \u2015 which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore \u2015 has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.\n\nSo Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesn\u2019t campaign on the grounds that Adelson\u2019s hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.\n\nThe Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal. But bills introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) floundered in Congress amid opposition from both parties and lobbying from those casino companies that had invested in online gaming. Adelson\u2019s lobbying group then focused on convincing the Justice Department to simply issue a new legal opinion overturning the old one.\n\nCharles Cooper, a Washington lawyer working for Adelson, lobbied the Justice Department, sending a memo in 2017 that made the legal argument for upending the 2011 opinion, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nJanuary\u2019s reversal wasn\u2019t the first big victory for Adelson under the Trump administration. Adelson is a longtime supporter of right-wing political parties in Israel and the idea of locating the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. In May 2018, he was a guest of honor at the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump decided to move it from Tel Aviv.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-justin-fairfax-resignation_us_5c5e35ece4b0eec79b236fb9": "Top Democrats representing states across the country called on Virginia Lt.

He received a letter telling him that he would be getting a monthly sum of \u20ac560 ($640) from the Finnish government, no strings attached, for two years.\n\n\u201cIt was actually like winning the lottery,\u201d said Muraja, who was one of 2,000 people randomly selected from a pool of 175,000 unemployed Finns, aged 25 to 58, to take part in one of the most prominent universal basic income trials in the world.\n\nSince losing his staff job as a journalist in 2013, Muraja has struggled to find permanent work. Every month he was trying to scramble together money for his rent of about $2,270 from freelance writing gigs, which came sporadically and often paid late. The government\u2019s basic income scheme gave him freedom. He could keep the cash, even if he found work, and he wouldn\u2019t have to contend with the constrictive bureaucracy of Finland\u2019s complex welfare system.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel free you are creative, and when you are creative you are productive, and that helps the whole of society,\u201d said Muraja, who has written a book about his experiences with the trial.\n\nFinland\u2019s universal basic income test, which cost the government about $22.7 million, was designed and administered by the country\u2019s social insurance agency, Kela. The experiment aimed to help the country assess how to respond to the changing nature of work and \u2015 given its 8-percent unemployment rate at the time \u2015 how to get people back into the labor market.\n\nThe trial ended in December. While final results won\u2019t be available until 2020, preliminary results were revealed on Friday.\n\nEmmi Tulokas Tuomas Muraja was one of the 2,000 people selected to take part in Finland's two-year universal basic income trial.\n\nOn employment, the country\u2019s income register showed no significant effects for 2017, the first year of the trial.\n\nThe real benefits so far have come in terms of health and well being. The 2,000 participants were surveyed, along with a control group of 5,000. Compared with the control group, those taking part had \u201cclearly fewer problems related to health, stress, mood and concentration,\u201d said Minna Ylik\u00e4nn\u00f6, senior researcher at Kela. Results also showed people had more trust in their future and their ability to influence it.\n\n\u201cConstant stress and financial stress for the long term \u2013 it\u2019s unbearable. And when we give money to people once a month they know what they are going to get,\u201d said Ylik\u00e4nn\u00f6. \u201cIt was just \u20ac560 a month, but it gives you certainty, and certainty about the future is always a fundamental thing about well being.\u201d\n\nAware that Finland\u2019s trial is under an international spotlight, Olli Kangas, scientific leader of the scheme and professor at the University of Turku, expressed hope that the experiment not be written off on the basis of preliminary employment results. \u201cThe whole truth is much more complex, we need many more studies and research to find out,\u201d said Kangas.\n\nSubodh Agnihotri via Getty Images Helsinki, where Tuomas is based. Participants for the UBI trial were selected from across the country.\n\nUniversal basic income is an idea that\u2019s been swirling around for centuries and has been tried across the world. While it has come to mean many different things, in its purest definition, a universal basic income is granted to everyone, regardless of wealth, income or employment status, on an unconditional basis.\n\nThe policy has supporters on both sides of the political spectrum. Those on the left say it will help tackle poverty, reduce yawning inequality and help people fend off the threat of their job being automated. For advocates on the right, UBI is seen as an attractive way to simplify complex systems of welfare payment and reduce the size of government.\n\nTech billionaires, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, have thrown support behind the idea amid anger over their own extreme wealth. It\u2019s also caught the attention of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D.-N.Y.) who has floated UBI as part of a Green New Deal \u2013 the umbrella name for a host of policies to tackle climate change and reduce inequality.\n\nBut it\u2019s controversial, too. First, there\u2019s the cost. One estimation by journalist Annie Lowrey, who has written a book on UBI, says a $1,000 monthly payment would cost around $3.9 trillion a year. Other critics see UBI as an expensive, free handout that will discourage work and encourage laziness.\n\nThese longstanding tropes of the \u201clazy\u201d poor hold no water for 31-year-old Tanja Kauhanen, another participant in Finland\u2019s scheme. While the results so far may have shown no improvement in employment, she believes UBI helps people who are struggling. \u201cThink about it. It\u2019s such a carrot to get a job immediately, even if it\u2019s low paid.\u201d\n\nSanna Krook Tanja Kauhanen\n\nKauhanen used the money \u2015 and the time freed by no longer having to apply to multiple agencies for welfare benefits \u2015 to take a telemarketing job. Pay was low, but topped up with the basic income, it dramatically changed her quality of life. It helped her finally sort out finances, after years of scouring grocery stores for the cheapest bread, milk and cheese. \u201cI could go to a restaurant and have a normal dinner without thinking that, OK, I am going to have to eat noodles for the rest of the month,\u201d she said.\n\nThe end of the scheme was a shock, she said, for everyone who participated in the trial. \u201cWe all are in big trouble now to be honest, because what would happen to you if your income decreased by \u20ac600?\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s still working at her job, but is already running up debt and desperately searching for better-paying work.\n\nThe end of Finland\u2019s scheme was also a blow to those who had hoped the trial would be expanded and extended. Politicians \u201cwasted the opportunity of a lifetime to conduct the kind of trial that Finnish social policy experts had done preliminary research for for decades,\u201d said Antti Jauhiainen, a director of the think tank Parecon Finland.\n\nHe said the government was never really behind the experiment, because it was \u201csimultaneously pushing for cutting the existing benefits and adding surveillance and control of the unemployed.\u201d The Finnish government has now introduced an \u201cactivation model,\u201d which requires unemployed people to complete a minimum of training or work to receive full benefits.\n\nThe announcement that Finland had no plans for more UBI schemes followed the cancellation of another UBI trial in Ontario, Canada. That test, launched in April 2017, involved 4,000 people on low incomes who received up to $13,000 a year for individuals, and up to $18,000 for couples, although payments were reduced by 50 cents for every dollar they earned.\n\nThe program was axed in 2018, following the election of right-wing politician Doug Ford. The government cited the \u201cextraordinary cost for Ontario taxpayers.\u201d All payments will cease by March.\n\nBut there are experiments that are still going. A program in Kenya, for example, run by the charity GiveDirectly, has been giving out unconditional money since 2016 to more than 21,000 people in villages across the country in a trial set to last 12 years. Initial results show a boost to the well being of participants.\n\nAnd there are others on the horizon. In the U.S., a trial is about to kick off in Stockton, California, that will give $500 a month to 100 low-income families. And in Oakland, the tech incubator Y Combinator intends to start a UBI trial this year that would hand $1,000 a month with no strings attached to 1,000 people across two U.S. states for three years. In India, the main opposition party is running on a pledge to introduce a guaranteed minimum income for the country\u2019s poor.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Stockton, California, Mayor Michael Tubbs has launched a program to provide universal basic income to a group of low-income residents.\n\nAs a policy idea, UBI is certainly not dead yet. \u201cWhether UBI is considered workable will of course depend on the results of these kinds of experiments and the political situation,\u201d said Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that there is a basic income program in the United States already that has been running for around 40 years: the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. So it\u2019s not as hypothetical as some people seem to think.\u201d Alaska hands residents annual, unconditional checks of $1,000 to $3,000.\n\nFinland is readying itself for elections in two months, and some hope that UBI could be back on the table. Kauhanen is among them. \u201cI loved the basic income experience,\u201d she said, \u201cand I wish that it would be for all people in Finland. I know it\u2019s expensive, but on a smaller scale, I think it would be just what we need because right now in Finland, the poor people are the ones who are getting cut off.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-spicer-interview-donald-trump-sotu_us_5c5c09bfe4b09293b20bd0bd": "Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave his unique take on President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address during a live online broadcast for conservative BlazeTV.\n\nAnd, well, people had thoughts.\n\nSpicer occasionally slurred his words as he struggled to make a coherent point about Trump campaign aide Katrina Pierson, proclaimed his love for velvet and poked fun at the suit being worn by the show\u2019s host Eric Bolling (who parted ways with Fox News in 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct).\n\nSpicer, who was Trump\u2019s first press secretary, also revealed he\u2019d been \u201cagnostic\u201d about which Republican he wanted to beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and claimed Trump recently invited him back to work in the White House \u2014 but he turned it down because he was having \u201ctoo much fun.\u201d\n\nClearly.\n\nCheck out the interview from the 3:33 mark here:\n\nThe interview, conducted in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, inevitably trended on Twitter \u2015 where folks suggested the cause of Spicer\u2019s apparent merriment:\n\nSNL is going to have so much fun with drunk Sean Spicer #SOTU \u2014 John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) February 6, 2019\n\nHow much more would everyone have enjoyed the White House press briefings if Spicer had been drunk for them?

Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax would replace Northam \u2015 but he would do so under the cloud of a sexual misconduct allegation that just became public.

But in Virginia\u2019s latest \u201ccan you believe this\u201d moment, Herring on Wednesday fessed up to his own youthful incident of racism.\n\nAll this in a state where Democrats had been riding a strong wave of political momentum.\n\nThe wildfire of political chaos began when the racist image surfaced on Northam\u2019s 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook page, which also features images of the medical school graduate and his name artfully written in calligraphy at the top.\n\nEastern Virginia Medical School A 1984 yearbook page for Gov. Ralph Northam shows two men in racist garb, though it remains unclear which, if either, is Northam.\n\nBacklash to the image was swift, with top Democratic leaders both inside the state and out calling for Northam\u2019s resignation. The disgraced governor immediately issued an apology, saying he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now.\u201d\n\nBut then, Northam changed his story the following day, suddenly adamant that he was not in the photo. In a weekend press conference, Northam argued he would have had a clear memory of being in blackface or a KKK robe, because he did have a clear memory of a time he did wear blackface.\n\n\u201cThat same year [as the yearbook\u2019s release] I did participate in a dance contest... in which I darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume,\u201d Northam told reporters. Providing elaboration when none were necessarily needed, he added that he won the contest by imitating the late pop singer\u2019s signature move \u2015 the moonwalk.\n\nA reporter asked if the governor could still moonwalk. Northam appeared to mull the idea over before his wife, standing by his side, chided him for considering even considering it under \u201cinappropriate circumstances\u201d \u2015 during a press conference about him being in blackface.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that a source close to Northam said the governor intended to hire a private investigator to examine the blackface/KKK photo. Nine of his former medical school classmates expressed support for Northam, issuing a statement that said they believe he is not in the photo.\n\nAs the furor built around Northam, attention quickly focused on Fairfax \u2015 who is black and has been viewed as a rising political star. But just two days after Northam\u2019s bizarre press conference, Fairfax faced his own troubles after an allegation of sexual assault against him surfaced. A woman claimed Fairfax assaulted her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\nIn a statement, Fairfax denied the claim. Meanwhile, NBC News reported that in a private meeting about the accusation on Monday, he said \u201cfuck that bitch,\u201d referring to the woman. Fairfax has denied using that phrase.\n\nNow comes the admission by Herring \u2015 who also seemed to have a promising political future \u2015 that he wore \u201cbrown makeup\u201d during a 1980 college party in which he wanted to look like musician Kurtis Blow. In his apology, Herring said \u201chonest conversations\u201d would ensue about whether he should continue to serve.\n\n\u201cThat I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nWhile dazed Virginians wait to see if other scandals emerge, they\u2019re at least getting a civics lesson on their state\u2019s line of gubernatorial succession.\n\nIf Northam, Fairfax and Herring all step down, Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox \u2015 a Republican \u2015 would become governor. But freak circumstances surround even Cox\u2019s position.\n\nGOP control of the state House of Delegates \u2015 and Cox\u2019s selection as speaker \u2015 occurred after a tie for a House seat in the state\u2019s November 2017 election was settled in favor of a Republican. And how did that Republican become the winner over his Democratic opponent? His name was picked out of a bowl.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grandpa-lampshade-neo-nazi-white-supremacist_us_5c5b12f9e4b00187b557717a": "A few days before alleged gunman Robert Bowers murdered 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October, he promoted a post by a well-known racist user of Gab, a social media platform that caters to white supremacists. The user had a \u201cPepe\u201d frog avatar and a distinctly offensive moniker \u2014 \u201cGrandpa Lampshade,\u201d a reference to an apocryphal story about a Nazi woman who made lampshades from the skin of Holocaust victims.\n\nOn Gab, where Bowers appears to have been radicalized, Grandpa Lampshade has published thousands of messages designed to stoke hatred of Jews. Like the one Bowers reposted:\n\nGab\n\nBut there were many posts that were worse. Many that might inspire a person to scream \u201cAll Jews must die!\u201d before shooting up a synagogue because he\u2019d bought into alt-right propaganda falsely claiming that Jews had orchestrated a migrant caravan heading toward the United States. Messages like this:\n\nGab\n\nAnd this:\n\nGab\n\nBut Grandpa Lampshade\u2019s efforts to spread hate weren\u2019t limited to Gab and didn\u2019t stop at anti-Semitism. During his weekly \u201cThoughts of the Day\u201d podcast on Radio Aryan, which he said reached thousands of listeners, he ranted about the hordes of black and brown invaders he claimed were displacing white people.\n\nHe often made it sound like violence was the only appropriate response.\n\nOn one podcast a few weeks before the Pittsburgh shooting, Grandpa Lampshade said that whites are \u201cnot gonna outbreed all of these blacks and browns\u201d and that the \u201canswer\u201d might \u201cinvolve a whole lotta killin\u2019.\u201d After the Oct. 27, 2018, massacre, he suggested that murdering 11 random Jews in a synagogue might not be the best approach, because of the scrutiny it attracted to the white supremacist movement and its chosen propaganda platforms. Better, he said, for the killin\u2019 to focus on strategic targets.\n\nThere was a twang to his voice and some grizzle in his chosen handle \u2014 they were clues to his identity. Grandpa Lampshade fretted about being exposed, but he\u2019d been sloppy in covering his tracks. He used the name \u201coilylizzard\u201d in one email address to collect donations and in another email linked to his real name. His wife advertised his now-defunct Grandpa Lampshade Twitter account in memes she\u2019d posted years ago.\n\nAnd people were looking for him. His rapid rise to prominence in the white nationalist community had brought him to the attention of anti-fascist activists. Watchdog groups and journalists were looking for him, too. Grandpa Lampshade had gone big-time. The podcast had played on the Daily Stormer, the internet\u2019s main hub for neo-Nazi content, from where he solicited bitcoin donations. (He has raised and spent almost $7,000 in bitcoin, according to information security researcher John Bambenek, who tracks neo-Nazi bitcoin transactions.)\n\nGrandpa Lampshade also forged connections with prominent white supremacists such as Andrew Anglin, Christopher \u201cThe Crying Nazi\u201d Cantwell, Robert \u201cAzzmador\u201d Ray and David Duke \u2014 just a few of the extremists who helped organize or participated in the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade was, undoubtedly, a problem. In a bygone era, he might have donned a hood and burned a cross in a remote field. But he likely would have been little more than a local malignancy. In the social media age, however, he could reach through his keyboard and contact the world. The neo-Nazi next door could be your neighbor. Your own kid could be listening to Grandpa Lampshade. And the anonymity of the internet allowed him to operate without hindrance or consequence.\n\nUntil now.\n\nBehind the Pepe mask and the Nazi pseudonym is a very average 51-year-old who represents how commonplace racism is in America. He lives about an hour outside Fort Worth, Texas, in a small town called Granbury. He works at an auto parts store. He likes motorcycles. He used to chew Red Man tobacco. He got married. He had a son. He got divorced. He remarried in blue jeans. He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nMeet Daniel Kenneth Jeffreys:\n\nInstagram\n\nJeffreys is an unremarkable man who has attained a position of influence thanks simply to an internet connection and an appetite for hate. He is the aggrieved white Everyman, a middle-aged schlub exalted and radicalized through social media at a time when the president has seemingly given every racist in America the feels.\n\nHe once worked as a youth activities supervisor at the now-shuttered Texas Youth Commission, the state\u2019s notorious juvenile corrections agency. (In 2007, long after Jeffreys had left his job, local media revealed that hundreds of troubled kids had been abused by agency employees. There is no evidence that Jeffreys was involved in the abuse.)\n\nHis journey to extremism does have an atypical arc. Unlike most of his alt-right fellow travelers, Jeffreys doesn\u2019t appear to have fully radicalized until later in life, when he was exposed to online propaganda created by millennial neo-Nazis. (Bowers, another Gen-Xer, also appears to have been radicalized later in life.)\n\nWe are not publishing Jeffreys\u2019 address or contact information \u2014 we are not \u201cdoxing\u201d him. We are exposing him. Left untreated, the racism he represents festers and metastasizes. And he is not a passive racist. He is a preacher of hate with a national reach \u2014 and as an undercover propagandist, he was a hidden threat within his own community.\n\nFrom Yahoo Comments To The Daily Stormer\n\nJeffreys has been fascinated with Nazi Germany since he was a kid, he told listeners of his podcast in March 2016. He liked seeing people who looked like him \u201caccomplishing these great things,\u201d he said. Jeffreys grew up mirroring the conservative politics of his parents, who supported Ronald Reagan. He eventually ditched the Republican Party out of loyalty to Pat Buchanan, a Holocaust-denying commentator \u2014 and a source of inspiration for members of the alt-right \u2014 who twice failed to secure the GOP presidential nomination. Jeffreys then dabbled in the conspiratorial libertarianism of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, another mainstream politician who has served as a conduit to white nationalism.\n\nIn 1991, when Jeffreys was 24, he started working at the Texas Youth Commission. He would mention the job years later in an episode of his show with Anglin as part of his argument that \u201cAmerican blacks are really like spoiled children.\u201d Jeffreys falsely claimed on the show that \u201ca huge majority\u201d of the \u201cinmate population were blacks.\u201d Jeffreys resigned voluntarily in 1996, according to Brian Sweany, a spokesman at the agency that replaced the Youth Commission.\n\nBy then, Jeffreys had married his first wife. Years later, that marriage ended in divorce. In 2003, Jeffreys got a job at an auto parts store, according to bankruptcy filings. The following year, he remarried. His wedding photos, which his mother-in-law posted to Facebook, show Jeffreys in jeans, with a handlebar mustache.\n\nFacebook\n\nJeffreys\u2019 new wife shared his enthusiasm for automobiles as well as his racist tendencies. She posted offensive content on Twitter under an account named Gothmamba, which public records indicate is registered to her.\n\nTwitter\n\nMoney was in short supply for the couple. They filed for bankruptcy the year after they married. Dan Jeffreys listed a shotgun, a pistol and two rifles as assets. He was nearly $130,000 in debt and earned about $2,100 a month, according to bankruptcy records.\n\nJeffreys eventually worked his way up to manager at another auto parts store in a nearby town. It was, as he\u2019d later say on a Grandpa Lampshade podcast, a \u201cnormie\u201d job where he interacted every day with different people, including \u201cMexicans\u201d and \u201cniggers.\u201d His wife opened an auto body paint shop specializing in \u201cCustom painting, Flames Etc.\u201d She posted hundreds of pictures of her bright orange muscle car on Instagram. Her business\u2019s Twitter account follows Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.\n\nJeffreys might have carried on in this vein forever, the down-home racist slinging crankshafts and crackpot ideas, a bigot indistinguishable from any other in the area. But one day while clicking through the comments on a Yahoo news story, he spotted another reader\u2019s recommendation to check out a website called the Daily Stormer. So he did.\n\nThe troll-y online gathering place for today\u2019s millennial neo-Nazi movement, the Daily Stormer has featured numerous posts calling for the genocide of Jews. A few years ago, it surpassed Stormfront \u2014 an older white nationalist message board that Jeffreys has said didn\u2019t \u201cgrab\u201d him \u2014 as the leading hate site on the internet. The Daily Stormer\u2019s founder and editor, Andrew Anglin, has perfected a humorous meme-laden style of blogging that makes the lies and hate he pushes appealing to a younger audience already steeped in internet culture. But the Daily Stormer, which has also celebrated violence against minorities, journalists and women, appeals to older racists, too. Jeffreys, a middle-aged, working-class Texan, thought the site was funny and kept coming back.\n\nEventually, his Daily Stormer-inspired self-indoctrination led him to \u201cThe Greatest Story Never Told,\u201d a six-hour-long revisionist film from 2013 about Adolf Hitler. Jeffreys was \u201cblown away\u201d by the film.\n\n\u201cThe light then completely shone on me,\u201d he said.\n\nJeffreys went on to read Mein Kampf and started hanging out in Daily Stormer chat rooms, where Anglin\u2019s readers plan real-world gatherings and in-person activism through his \u201cDaily Stormer Book Club\u201d network \u2014 from attending far-right rallies to posting neo-Nazi flyers in cities around the country. On the Daily Stormer, Jeffreys befriended \u201cSven Longshanks\u201d aka Steve Stone. Stone is a British Hitler fanatic and host at Radio Aryan, a white nationalist online radio network that is based in the United Kingdom and broadcasts from a secret location. British government regulators have been unable to police the neo-Nazi network because it transmits over the internet. Jeffreys pressed Stone to let him record his own show on the network; eventually, Stone agreed.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade\u2019s \u201cThoughts of the Day\u201d podcast debuted in February 2016. Jeffreys launched his Semitic Truth Center blog shortly afterward. Within months, he had become an influential neo-Nazi propagandist.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade Finds His Fans\n\nSome of the best-known members of the white supremacist community were soon talking with Jeffreys. He recorded shows with Duke, the former KKK grand wizard; Robert \u201cAzzmador\u201d Ray, an Anglin associate and longtime racist from east Texas who yelled, \u201cDeath to the enemies of the white race!\u201d hours after the Charlottesville rally; Gabriel Sohier Chaput, a Canadian neo-Nazi recruiter who goes by \u201cZeiger\u201d; Chris Cantwell, who cried over an arrest warrant and then pleaded guilty to assaulting counterprotesters at Charlottesville \u2014 and even Anglin himself.\n\n\u201cYours is one of my favorite podcasts. I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the top three,\u201d Anglin told Jeffreys in June 2016 when he appeared as a guest on Jeffreys\u2019 show.\n\nJeffreys\u2019 message is virtually indistinguishable from the conspiratorial ravings of his colleagues: White people, he claims, are the victims of a world order controlled by the Jews, who are actively replacing white Americans with black and brown invaders. This is the central and most hackneyed of white supremacist conspiracy theories, one that gives aggrieved race warriors an eternal enemy to rail against and blame for their own shortcomings. Jeffreys faults Jewish people for everything from Communism to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being served now with a cake that\u2019s been poisoned. Cake with ingredients such as feminism, this racial demographic, multicultural time bomb,\u201d Jeffreys said on his show last October. \u201cAll of these ingredients have been baked into this cake. And the baker is a hook-nosed rat Jew.\u201d\n\nWhat sets Jeffreys apart from his fellow neo-Nazi podcasters is his oddly pleasant demeanor. Unlike the jabbering Cantwell, who has the on-air presence of Archie Bunker on meth, Jeffreys delivers his sales pitch with a sing-song Southern drawl that belies the inherent violence of his worldview. He prefaces Holocaust-denying rants with a perfunctory \u201cMy gosh!\u201d\n\nUnlike most of his alt-right colleagues, Jeffreys also brings an authentic working-class Christian flavor to his racism. He has a recurring segment on his podcast that he calls \u201cThe Church of the Lampshade,\u201d in which he preaches about the devil being the father of Jews. He is the traditionalist so many white nationalists aspire and fail to be, a family man who likes to talk about how he lovingly imparts his racist views to his son \u2014 just like Jeffreys\u2019 father once did with him.\n\n\u201cI mean, the best thing I can say is, you know, just make \u2019em as Jew-wise as you can. Best safety advice you can give \u2019em boils down to \u2018when around blacks, never relax,\u2019\u201d Jeffreys once said of his conversations with his son. \u201cMy dad has said, you know, he doesn\u2019t believe blacks are a separate race, he believes they\u2019re a separate species \u2014 and the older I get, the more I realize that, you know, he was closer to the truth than any college professor,\u201d he continued.\n\nThroughout these last few years of hate-mongering screeds, Jeffreys has made a deliberate effort to stop just shy of instructing his fans to commit violence against enemies of the white race. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s a \u201cpeace-loving hipp[y],\u201d he said \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t want to get kicked offline and end up in prison for endorsing bloodshed too explicitly.\n\n\u201cJust look at the amount of effort our enemies go through to try and choke out the Daily Stormer through limiting fundraising ability,\u201d he said in January 2017. \u201cWhat do you think would happen if we gave them the opportunity to declare us all as being a part of some sort of terrorist organization or something? At the very least, we would not have our platforms anymore \u2015 and at the worst, we would all be bunking up in a federal prison somewhere.\u201d\n\nBut some Grandpa Lampshade fans don\u2019t think like that. The Pittsburgh shooter, at least, was willing to act on the violent ideology Jeffreys promoted.\n\nGab\n\nJeffreys didn\u2019t feel bad for the 11 people killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue, he said on his show a week after the attack. But he was upset about the backlash. Internet service providers abandoned Gab, forcing it to go offline temporarily. Wordpress took down Jeffreys\u2019 blog after a commenter posted a \u201cbattle plan\u201d on the site: \u201cShooting of Jews every week \u2015 until normies start to wonder why people hate Jews so much and start doing their research.\u201d\n\nWordpress Archive\n\nJeffreys implored his listeners to be more strategic in choosing which Jews to murder. He knew some of his listeners were \u201chalf a step away from being the next Bowers,\u201d he said, but he wanted them to make sure their attack would be worth it.\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re gonna get the death penalty and your grievance is that the Jews are doing all of these things and you\u2019re willing to take action that is going to result in the death penalty \u2026 if you\u2019re gonna do this, why are you gonna go kill some random Jews when you have these high-profile Jews?\u201d he asked.\n\nThis is hardly a disavowal of the violence that is foundational to white nationalism. It is, rather, a horrific suggestion from Jeffreys that targeted killings might be a more effective way to spark the white ethnostate Nazis dream of. A far safer way to feed the white nationalist movement, as Jeffreys knows, is to maintain a footprint on the platforms that give him and other neo-Nazis such far-flung reach. Platforms like Gab or Radio Aryan or the Daily Stormer. Or Twitter. Platforms that can turn a racist nobody hawking auto parts into a somebody selling hate around the world.\n\nLast week, HuffPost called the auto parts store where Jeffreys works and asked to speak with him. Whoever answered the phone hung up quickly. Hours later, Grandpa Lampshade announced that he was quitting his Radio Aryan show. He told his listeners that he wanted to spend more time with his family \u201cliving the 14 words.\u201d\n\nBut it was clear that Jeffreys knew people were onto him. He was on guard.\n\nUnder The Mask, The Everyman Racist\n\nGranbury is an ordinary town of about 8,000 people southwest of Fort Worth. Cows and llamas graze in nearby pastures. The downtown is centered around a courthouse, surrounded by a few restaurants. Fox News plays in the lobby of the Holiday Inn. Though Granbury was named for a Confederate general, it was hard to imagine a neo-Nazi cranking out propaganda for a national audience from this bland little burg.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jeffreys was at his job at the auto parts store several miles up the highway, his wife\u2019s bright orange muscle car parked outside. When HuffPost reporters approached him to confirm his identity and ask about his racist alter ego, he agreed to talk outside on the store\u2019s front steps. He was visibly nervous.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s doxing me?\u201d he asked, holding a paint can and using the far-right\u2019s preferred term for any journalism that exposes extremists.\n\nHe was worried about anti-fascist activists in the area and claimed he had received death threats. He didn\u2019t want to lose his job. He said he\u2019d ended his show and wanted to be left alone to take care of his family. He claimed that he\u2019d never called for violence on the podcast \u2014 but he had, several times.\n\n\u201cI mean we may have some killin\u2019 involved, but maybe not a whole lotta killin\u2019,\u201d he said on his podcast in October, weeks before the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.\n\nWhen asked about the podcast episode after that massacre, the one where he questioned the purpose of killing \u201crandom Jews\u201d instead of \u201chigh-profile Jews,\u201d Jeffreys said that people bent on violence can\u2019t be swayed with appeals to morality. Better, he said, to talk strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not responsible for crazy people doing crazy shit,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter speaking with HuffPost, Jeffreys took old episodes of his show offline. But he is still responsible for promoting an ideology in which violence against Jewish and non-white people is not only justified but ultimately required.\n\nLike most alt-right podcasters, Grandpa Lampshade spoke with a swaggering confidence about racially transforming the country. Social media had made him important. Made him a leader. Anonymity made him unaccountable. There was no telling how many angry white men he\u2019d helped push further down the path to extremism. Grandpa Lampshade mattered. He had influence.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-dingell-dead-congress_us_57042d5de4b0a506064d7398": "Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images John Dingell served in Congress for just shy of 60 years.\n\nJohn Dingell Jr., the Michigan Democrat who became the longest-serving member of Congress, died Thursday at age 92.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of John David Dingell Jr., former Michigan Congressman and longest-serving member of the United States Congress,\u201d said a statement late Thursday from the office of his wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). \u201cCongressman Dingell died peacefully today at his home in Dearborn ... . He was a lion of the United States Congress and a loving son, father, husband, grandfather, and friend.

Gretchen Whitmer said Dingell will \u201cforever be remembered as \u2018The Dean\u2019 of Congress,\u201d noting his roles in passing the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe are a stronger, safer, healthier nation because of Congressman Dingell\u2019s 59 years of service, and his work will continue to improve the lives of Michiganders for generations to come,\u201d she said in a statement Thursday night.\n\nAn old-school Democrat, Dingell represented southeastern Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives for 59 years before retiring in 2015.\n\nUpon hearing of his retirement plans, President Barack Obama called Dingell \u201cone of the most influential legislators of all time,\u201d a sentiment he echoed when awarding the longtime congressman the Presidential Medal of Freedom in late 2014.\n\nDingell was diagnosed around a year ago with prostate cancer, his family said, and he decided not to treat it as it metastasized, opting instead for hospice care.\n\nOver his nearly six decades in Congress, the spirited Dingell played a key role in advancing a slew of landmark laws, including the 1965 legislation that created Medicare, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Appreciated for his sense of humor and wit, he was also one of the last veterans of World War II to serve in Congress.\n\nIf he had his way, though, the legislative branch in which he served for so long would operate much differently: Dingell was a strong proponent of abolishing the Senate. He argued that it does not represent the interests of the American people, calling for a grassroots movement to combine the two chambers into one.\n\nCQ Roll Call via Getty Images House Speaker Sam Rayburn swears in 29-year-old John Dingell Jr. on Dec. 13, 1955.\n\nDingell was born in Colorado Springs on July 8, 1926. His political life began early: His father, John Dingell, was elected in 1932 to represent what was then Michigan\u2019s 15th Congressional District.\n\nAfter growing up in the Great Depression on peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwiches, the younger Dingell spent his teen years as a page in the U.S. House, from 1938 to 1943. He joined the U.S. Army in 1944, serving until 1946. With the end of the war, Dingell went on to earn his undergraduate and law degrees at Georgetown University. He married his first wife, Helen Henebry, with whom he had four children.\n\nHe was working as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County, Michigan, when his father died in 1955, prompting Dingell Jr. to enter and win the special election to fill his late father\u2019s congressional seat. While the borders and numbering of the districts would shift over the decades, he would be re-elected to the House 29 times, usually by comfortable margins.\n\nDingell\u2019s power base within Congress was the House Commerce Committee (now officially the House Energy and Commerce Committee), which oversees a broad range of issues and federal activities. He served on the panel for more than 57 years, including about 16 years as chairman. He was known for his demanding demeanor with witnesses, including government officials, and his penchant for sending harshly worded letters, or \u201cDingellgrams,\u201d by the hundreds to agency leaders.\n\n\u201cI try to be humane on the issues, but there are times I have to be ruthless. I am not here to be a well-liked patsy,\u201d Dingell told People magazine in 1986.\n\nDouglas Graham/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Dingell and then-Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), seen here during a 1997 hearing on managed care reform. The two worked for years to advance universal health care.\n\nDingell introduced a bill to provide universal health care each term he was in Congress. It was a measure first introduced by his father, a strong proponent of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. During his time in Congress, the younger Dingell\u2019s persistence slowly brought reforms to the country\u2019s health care programs.\n\n\u201cAs I have revised the bill over the years, we found about half of the original legislation has been enacted into law,\u201d he told NPR in 2009.\n\nIn 1965, Dingell presided over the House as it passed a bill to establish Medicare, a program his father had also initially proposed. He also helped enact children\u2019s health insurance and vaccine initiatives.\n\nObama recognized the lawmaker\u2019s contributions toward the Affordable Care Act in a statement on Dingell\u2019s retirement.\n\n\u201cOf all John\u2019s accomplishments, perhaps the most remarkable has been his tireless fight to guarantee quality, affordable health care for every American. ... And as an original author of the Affordable Care Act, he helped give millions of families the peace of mind of knowing they won\u2019t lose everything if they get sick,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Rep.

Pelosi is holding the gavel that Dingell used when he presided over the vote to pass Medicare in 1965 and that she used during the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDingell\u2019s reach went well beyond health care, however. He was a strong proponent of the environment and heavily involved in crafting key legislation to combat pollution, save endangered species and require the government to consider the environmental consequences of development.\n\nAsked in a Reddit Q&A last year why Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about global warming, Dingell replied with a heaping serving of snark: \u201cBecause they\u2019re preparing for the hot place in hell that awaits many of them?\u201d\n\nThe former congressman also helped create North America\u2019s first international wildlife refuge along the Detroit River. A new visitors center at the refuge was named in his honor in January 2017.\n\nOf the 28,551 votes he cast in Congress, Dingell called his support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 his \u201csingle most important vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did give the country a tremendous amount of hope that we could move to other things that were important,\u201d he said, reflecting on the landmark law in 2012.\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Dingell talks about the caribou and elk antlers that adorn the walls of his congressional office in 2014.\n\nDingell was an avid hunter who decorated his Capitol Hill office with the trophies of his kills. His strong advocacy of gun rights, however, earned him criticism from progressives along with high ratings from the National Rifle Association. He served on the NRA\u2019s board of directors for years, but resigned in 1994 as he prepared to vote for an NRA-opposed crime bill that banned a number of assault weapons. (Dingell said he opposed the weapon ban but supported the bill.)\n\nProgressive allies also criticized the Michigan congressman for his longtime support of the auto industry, which led him to oppose stricter vehicle fuel-efficiency standards.

Later Thursday, the Department of Justice released a statement confirming Whitaker\u2019s scheduled appearance.\n\n\u201cActing Attorney General Whitaker looks forward to voluntarily appearing at tomorrow\u2019s hearing and discussing the great work of the Department of Justice,\u201d the statement from DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nEarlier:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is trying to back out of his scheduled Friday testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after the committee voted to subpoena him if he refuses to answer questions about conversations he had with President Donald Trump and invokes executive privilege.\n\nIn a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that Whitaker would not testify unless the committee assures the Justice Department by 6 p.m. that it will not issue a subpoena for Whitaker today or tomorrow and that the committee would engage in \u201cgood faith negotiations\u201d with DOJ before issuing a subpoena.\n\nBy Thursday night, Nadler had attempted to keep Friday\u2019s hearing on schedule, writing in a letter to Whitaker that \u201cthere will be no need for the Committee to issue a subpoena\u201d if Whitaker is prepared to answer questions tomorrow. \u201cTo the extent that you believe you are unable to fully respond to any specific question, we are prepared to handle your concerns on a case-by-case basis, both during and after tomorrow\u2019s hearing,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe high-stakes exchange came after several weeks of negotiations between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee; Whitaker is set to testify voluntarily on Friday about a number of topics. House Democrats plan to press him on his conversations with Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIf Whitaker does testify, the letter said, he would say \u201cat no time did the White House ask for, or did the Acting Attorney General provide, any promises or commitments concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nA senior Justice Department official, speaking on background, told reporters Thursday afternoon that Whitaker had been \u201cworking hard\u201d this week to prepare for his testimony, but that he wasn\u2019t going to testify under threat of subpoena on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the appropriate process... to subpoena first, talk later,\u201d the senior official said. Whitaker, the official said, is \u201cready and willing to appear\u201d under the original terms.\n\nWhitaker, who headed up a conservative organization that targeted Democrats and critiqued the Mueller investigation in cable news hits before joining the Justice Department, was named acting attorney general following the forced resignation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in November. Whitaker previously served as a U.S. attorney during the Bush administration but was not serving in a Senate-confirmed Justice Department role when he was named acting attorney general, making his lengthy term as head of DOJ historically unprecedented.\n\nThe Justice Department issued this statement from Whitaker:\n\n\u201cWeeks ago, in good faith, I voluntarily agreed to appear and testify on February 8 before the House Judiciary Committee. We have devoted considerable resources and numerous hours to my preparation, and I have looked forward to discussing the important work of the great men and women of the Department of Justice. Unfortunately, the Committee now has deviated from historic practice and protocol and taken the unnecessary and premature step of authorizing a subpoena to the me, the Acting Attorney General, even though I had agreed to voluntarily appear. Such unprecedented action breaches our prior agreement and circumvents the constitutionally required accommodation process. Based upon today\u2019s action, it is apparent that the Committee\u2019s true intention is not to discuss the great work of the Department of Justice, but to create a public spectacle. Political theater is not the purpose of an oversight hearing, and I will not allow that to be the case.\n\nThe news came out around the same time as William Barr, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general was cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

(For reference, there were 40,000 gun deaths last year, about two-thirds of which were suicides, compared with one rough estimate of 400 homicides attributed to illegal immigrants.) Gaetz said that funding a border wall would help curb both problems.

He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers \u2014 including his own Secret Service detail \u2014 began their second month without a paycheck.\n\nNow, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nOne former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way he gets it done,\u201d said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump. \u201cAnd screw Puerto Rico,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cPuerto Rico doesn\u2019t have electoral votes last time I checked.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.\n\nWhile Trump has the authority to declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill \u2014 a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.\n\nOne of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. \u201cI would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,\u201d he said of the possible emergency declaration. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad law and I think it\u2019s bad strategy for the president.\u201d\n\nKeeping The Public Scared\n\nTrump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an \u201cemergency\u201d that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trump\u2019s own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.\n\nMigrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201cvery bad people.\u201d\n\nWhen the November election passed, so did Trump\u2019s interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up \u201ccaravans\u201d until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.\n\nTrump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last month\u2019s shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native \u2014 also white \u2014 has been charged in those slayings.\n\n\u201cHe continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. That\u2019s his MO. It\u2019s not new,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201cUnfortunately, it works, among some people. But it\u2019s really cynical politics.\u201d\n\nTriggering A National Emergency\n\nCynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.\n\nTrump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2015 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities,\u201d Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. \u201cNow, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.\u201d\n\nThat brought a rebuke from the city\u2019s mayor the next day. \u201cWe are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,\u201d Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC. \u201cI talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But we\u2019ve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation.\u201d\n\nPrimarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.\n\nWhile Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nDoing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a \u201cjoint resolution\u201d of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans \u2014 and could possibly lose a good deal more.\n\nSome Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m urging the president to tread carefully,\u201d said Texas Republican John Cornyn.\n\nSusan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach. \u201cI think I\u2019ve expressed serious concern about going down that path but let\u2019s wait and see what the president does before we decide,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d he told reporters late last week. \u201cWe will be looking at a national emergency, because I don\u2019t think anything is going to happen. I think the Democrats don\u2019t want border security.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-democrats-split-on-blackface-is-a-problem_us_5c58c81de4b09293b2077b05": "ASSOCIATED PRESS The medical school yearbook of Virginia Gov.

Democrats say it\u2019s unacceptable by a wider 78 percent to 12 percent. Republicans, by contrast, are close to evenly divided, with 36 percent calling blackface acceptable, 38 percent calling it unacceptable, and the rest unsure.\n\nOpinions are also divided starkly along racial lines. Black Americans say, 80 percent to 6 percent, that blackface is unacceptable, with 13 percent unsure; white Americans call blackface unacceptable by a smaller 50 percent to 27 percent margin, with 22 percent uncertain. Southern Democrats \u2015 many of whom are black \u2015 say by a 74-point margin that white people wearing blackface is unacceptable, while Democrats in the rest of the country say it\u2019s unacceptable by a 62-point margin.\n\nAnd there\u2019s an even sharper divide along the lines of the last presidential election. Hillary Clinton voters say by a 72-point margin that blackface is unacceptable. Donald Trump voters say, by a 10-point margin, that it\u2019s OK.\n\nThe poll was taken following the publication of a page from the medical school yearbook of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) that shows a person in blackface next to a person dressed as a member of the KKK. Northam initially apologized, indicating that he was pictured in the photo, then reversed course and denied he was in the picture. He later admitted he had worn blackface on a different occasion. Northam has so far ignored calls to resign. On Wednesday, after the survey was completed, the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, also admitted that he had worn blackface in college.\n\nA majority of those polled say they\u2019ve heard at least something about the controversy surrounding Northam.\n\nDemocrats are substantially likelier than Republicans to say the blackface photo should disqualify Northam from serving as governor. A 42 percent plurality of Democrats nationally call the photo disqualifying, with 27 percent saying it was relevant but not disqualifying, and 14 percent that it isn\u2019t relevant to his position as governor. By contrast, just 19 percent of Republicans called the photo disqualifying, with 26 percent saying it was relevant but not disqualifying, and 41 percent that it was irrelevant.\n\nNotably, however, the survey question did not identify which party Northam belongs to, a factor which may have both dampened his support among Democrats and boosted it among Republicans. Just 7 percent of Democrats thought that Northam had the support of most or all Democratic politicians, with 56 percent saying he had at most some party support and 37 percent unsure. Republicans were modestly more likely to think Northam had Democratic backing, but many were also unsure.\n\nPolling shows a significant, recent shift in attitudes in the Democratic Party about race and racist behavior. Between the years 2015 and 2018, the share of Democrats who said it was acceptable for whites to use the N-word dropped about 15 points. In the past decade, members of the party have also become increasingly likely to agree that \u201cblack people have gotten less than they deserve,\u201d and to cite racial discrimination as \u201cthe main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days.\u201d\n\nThe partisan gap in the public over issues of race has grown, even in recent years. In large part as a result of growing shares of Democrats taking more racially liberal views. Two examples here, on racial equality & discrimination.

Familiar topics, including his efforts to secure funding for a border wall, were centerpieces of the 82-minute speech, but new initiatives, such as plans to meet again with the North Korean leader and to tackle the spread of HIV, were also highlighted.\n\nHere are some of the major takeaways from the address.\n\nHe\u2019s still going after his wall, but it\u2019s now a \u201csee-through steel barrier.\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t backed down from his demand for a wall along America\u2019s southern border, but his definition of it has continued to evolve this year amid the fallout from a 35-day partial government shutdown, a closure that led to a one-week delay of the State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cThis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier \u2015 not just a simple concrete wall,\u201d the president declared Tuesday. \u201cIt will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cwalls work\u201d and \u201csave lives,\u201d and urged lawmakers to forge a compromise that will \u201ctruly make America safe.\u201d Democrats have long called for beefed-up border security, including new technology and more border agents, but have said a simple barrier would be costly and ineffective.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS \"Walls work\" and \"save lives,\" Trump said during his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe keeps mischaracterizing migrant \u201ccaravans\u201d seeking asylum.\n\nThe president spent weeks before last year\u2019s midterm elections sounding an alarm over a large caravan of Central American migrants, painting the migrants as criminals in an attempt to build fears and garner support for his proposed wall. Many of those people were fleeing violence, hoping to apply for asylum at the U.S. border.\n\nTrump on Tuesday once again moved to paint a new caravan of about 1,600 people as a danger to American society, saying that, \u201cas we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection,\u201d he said, pointing to his order to send an additional 3,750 troops to the border this week.\n\n\u201cThis is a moral issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well\u2011being of all Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the second time.\n\nThe president has long touted his efforts to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon program, and Trump said he would meet with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, for a second time later this month in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The president said he would meet with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in late February in Vietnam.\n\nThe meeting is scheduled to take place on Feb. 27 and 28, although critics have expressed skepticism about what progress can be made. Pyongyang has yet to give up any of the weaponry Trump has said it would, and American intelligence chiefs said last month that North Korea was \u201cunlikely to give up all of its [nuclear] stockpiles.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s fearmongering over late-term abortions.\n\nTrump has seized control of the anti-abortion talking point ahead of the 2020 election and urged Congress to \u201cdefend the dignity of every person\u201d during his State of the Union speech.\n\n\u201cI am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb,\u201d the president said. \u201cLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children \u2015 born and unborn \u2015 are made in the holy image of God.\u201d\n\nThe focus on such abortions comes after New York passed a new law last month that permits the termination of pregnancies after the 24th week only in the \u201cabsence of fetal viability\u201d or if the \u201cabortion is necessary to protect\u201d a mother\u2019s life or health. Such abortions are rare, amounting to 1.3 percent of total procedures in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAbortion rights advocates have lambasted Trump\u2019s imagery and characterizations of the law as absurd.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images The State of the Union stretched for 82 minutes on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe wants to \u201celiminate the HIV epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe president said he planned to implement a 10-year strategy to reduce and possibly end the spread of HIV infections in the United States, even though his administration has been criticized for its work on the issue so far.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS,\u201d Trump said. \u201cScientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.\u201d\n\nThough the move would amount to a major American policy initiative, the Trump administration has been criticized for leaving major HIV leadership positions unfilled for months. Vice President Mike Pence has also been criticized for his policies while he was governor of Indiana, where he oversaw cuts to public health funding that contributed to the worst HIV outbreak in the state\u2019s history.\n\nHe\u2019s doubling down on fossil fuel production.\n\nTrump has long touted America\u2019s renewed interest in fossil fuel production as a boon to the economy, despite increasingly dire reports from the world\u2019s leading scientists about the scourge of climate change.\n\n\u201cWe have unleashed a revolution in American energy \u2015 the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-fairfax-virginia-sexual-assault-allegation_us_5c588e9ae4b09293b20730f0": "ASSOCIATED PRESS/Steve Earley/The Virginian-Pilot Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) is one of the only elected officials in Virginia who has not called on Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to resign.\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2015 Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) vehemently denied a sexual assault allegation against him that resurfaced late Sunday, arguing it was timed to derail his potential ascent to the governorship.\n\n\u201cThis allegation is completely false,\u201d Fairfax said at an impromptu press conference in the Capitol rotunda on Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be 40 years old next month. I have lived 40 years accusation-free. And there\u2019s a reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also a reason, at the moment when people ... think that there\u2019s a possibility I might be elevated to the governorship \u2015 it\u2019s at that point that they come out with the attacks and the smears.\u201d\n\nThe woman accusing Fairfax of sexual assault has claimed he forced her to perform oral sex during an encounter that began consensually at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax maintains the encounter was entirely consensual and has threatened legal action to protect his reputation against a claim he called \u201cdefamatory.\u201d\n\nAt Monday\u2019s press conference, he also said the woman accusing him called him months after the encounter in question to try to meet up with her and meet her mother. When pressed for evidence of her subsequent communication, Fairfax said he did not have any because it had happened over the phone.\n\nFairfax has become the subject of national attention in recent days as pressure mounts on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to resign. Virtually every Democratic elected official in the state has withdrawn support for Northam after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page emerged Friday. Northam initially said he appeared in the photo, which shows a man in blackface standing with another man in a Ku Klux Klan uniform, but he subsequently recanted. At a Saturday press conference, Northam nonetheless admitted to another instance of wearing blackface.\n\nFairfax, the second black statewide elected official in Virginia\u2019s history, would succeed Northam if the governor resigned. (Fairfax has not called on Northam to resign; he declined to do so again at Monday\u2019s press conference.)\n\nThe chaos escalated Sunday night as the specter of scandal spread to Fairfax as well.\n\nBig League Politics, the same conservative news site that first published Northam\u2019s yearbook photo, published a screenshot of a social media post by a woman describing her sexual assault accusation against Fairfax.\n\n\u201cImagine you were sexually assaulted during the [Democratic National Convention] in Boston in 2004 by a campaign staffer. You spend the next 13 years trying to forget it ever happened,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cUntil one day you find out he\u2019s the Democratic candidate for statewide office in a state 3,000 miles away, and he wins that election in November 2017. Then by strange, horrible luck, it seems increasingly likely he\u2019ll get a VERY BIG promotion.\u201d\n\nIn the early hours of Monday morning, Fairfax\u2019s staff issued a statement denying the allegation. The statement, co-signed by Fairfax\u2019s chief of staff Lawrence Roberts and communications director Lauren Burke, said The Washington Post had investigated the allegation the previous year and decided not to publish a story on it due to the \u201cabsence of any evidence corroborating the allegation, and significant red flags and inconsistencies within the allegation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lt. Governor will take appropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation,\u201d Roberts and Burke said.\n\nHours later, the Post published its own version of events, denying that it had unearthed any \u201cred flags\u201d when the allegation came to the newspaper\u2019s attention in November 2017.\n\nThe woman described a sexual encounter that began with consensual kissing, but she said she eventually noticed that she could not move her neck. The woman alleged that Fairfax then forced her to perform oral sex through physical coercion, according to the Post.\n\nThe Post did not publish the story in November 2017 because it \u201ccould not find anyone who could corroborate either version,\u201d and it found no evidence of similar allegations after interviewing several people who knew Fairfax in college, law school and during his political career.\n\nFairfax and his staff are sticking by their story, and are accusing the Post of acting without journalistic integrity given its professed inability to corroborate the story.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official,\u201d Burke said in a statement. \u201cWe ask further: What other major elected official in the Commonwealth of Virginia would be smeared with sexual allegations that were presented without corroboration?\u201d\n\nI asked LG Fairfax's team what they make of the Post denying there were \"red flags\" with allegation story.\n\n\n\n\"The Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official.\" Full statement from staff is attached. pic.twitter.com/5rMtlcAenh \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 4, 2019\n\nWhen asked Monday whether he would welcome his accuser to share her story with the legislature, Fairfax did not explicitly reject the idea.\n\n\u201cAnyone is free to speak up and be heard,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a party, Democrats have declared their intolerance of sexual misconduct of any kind.\n\nThey mobilized en masse in an attempt to keep then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the high court after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her at a party in high school. Democrats argued that Ford\u2019s testimony before the Senate was credible and compelling enough to disqualify Kavanaugh from a justice position.\n\nFairfax\u2019s pushback \u2015 in particular, implying that a sexual assault survivor\u2019s allegation is less credible because the accuser reached out to the alleged assailant after the fact \u2015 has already elicited some criticism in progressive circles.\n\nMany sexual assault survivors have described befriending their attackers as a means of coping.\n\nLizzie Hylton, the political director of Clean Virginia, a Virginia-based progressive advocacy, highlighted that research, calling on Fairfax to \u201cstop spreading rape myths.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-have-found-their-future-and-it-looks-like-stacey-abrams_us_5c5a0395e4b0871047587092": "The Democratic Party\u2019s picks to give responses to President Donald Trump\u2019s first two addresses to Congress reflected the state of uncertainty the party found itself in. After giving the 2017 slot to then-72-year-old former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear \u2014 a backward-looking pick if there ever was one \u2014 they followed up with the selection of Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, best known for being the scion of the quintessential Democratic family.\n\nLawrence Bryant / Reuters Many Democrats want campaigns in the future to strike a balance between turning out the party's base and reaching out to the middle, as Stacey Abrams' campaign did.\n\nBoth speeches had their merits \u2014 Beshear\u2019s, in particular, previewed the party\u2019s relentless focus on health care during the midterm elections \u2014 but are mostly now remembered for the awkwardly lit diner where Beshear delivered his speech and for how wet Kennedy\u2019s lips appeared.\n\nFormer Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019 speech this year may also end up being remembered for something other than its content, if it\u2019s remembered at all. (It has been years since the State of the Union \u2014 or the opposition party\u2019s response \u2014 had an actual, measurable impact on American politics.) But Democratic leaders\u2019 decision to have Abrams deliver the response shows the party isn\u2019t quite as lost as it was in the months following Trump\u2019s surprising victory over Hillary Clinton. The party, or at least its top operatives, now knows in what direction it wants to head, and it\u2019s toward more candidates like Abrams.\n\nMany Democrats now view Abrams\u2019 campaign, which came up just short against Brian Kemp, a Trump acolyte, as a model for future candidates. The party, which spent much of 2017 and 2018 caught in a debate about whether it should focus on mobilizing young people and voters of color or winning over suburban voters who are disenchanted with Trump, views Abrams as proof it doesn\u2019t need to be a choice.\n\nAbrams, as a black woman who spent years courting donors to fund voter registration projects targeting people of color through her New Georgia Project, is often given the shorthand label of a progressive. But her 2018 campaign showed just as much dedication to reaching out to the middle as it did to firing up her party\u2019s base.\n\nAs early as her primary against Stacey Evans, Abrams positioned herself as a candidate who could appeal across Georgia\u2019s racial and urban-suburban-rural divides. In a 30-second ad titled \u201cGuys Like Me,\u201d a white union worker, speaking with a slight drawl, delivers his pitch for Abrams.\n\n\u201cShe understands all of Georgia,\u201d says Kenny Mullins, an official with a local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers chapter. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting against tax hikes that are going to hurt guys like me that get up at the crack of dawn to go and work long hours.\u201d\n\nThroughout the campaign, she continued reaching out to business groups and Republicans. In another spot, released in October, the Georgia Democratic Party noted she worked with the GOP and fought to stop \u201ca massive tax hike on Georgians.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can continue the progress we\u2019ve made by building each other up, not tearing each other down,\u201d Abrams says in the ad.\n\nAnd none of her outreach to the center took away from her work to register and turn out minority and young voters who were more likely to support Democrats. At the same time, she largely avoided embracing left-wing policy priorities like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cHer message was very open to everyone,\u201d said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who chaired the Democratic Governors Association during Abrams\u2019 run and funneled about $4.5 million to support her. \u201cIt was about economic opportunity. It wasn\u2019t exotic or avant-garde.\u201d\n\nThe result was sky-high turnout and a narrow loss in a state where Democrats had become accustomed to even highly sought-after recruits losing by substantial margins. (And Abrams\u2019 result must be considered in light of Kemp\u2019s influence as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state on the election process. She has said that the election was \u201cnot free and fair\u201d and that he enabled \u201cthe systemic dismantling of our democracy.\u201d)\n\nHer message went furthest in the state\u2019s suburbs: According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she won Cobb County, a populous suburb of Atlanta where former House Speaker Newt Gingrich began his political career, with 54 percent of the vote, four years after GOP then-Gov. Nathan Deal won it with 56 percent. In Gwinnett County, she garnered 57 percent of the vote, a massive spike from the 42 percent Democratic nominee Jason Carter got in the 2014 governor\u2019s contest.\n\nHer message was very open to everyone. It was about economic opportunity. It wasn\u2019t exotic or avant-garde. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, former chairman, Democratic Governors Association\n\nAbrams\u2019 bipartisan tendencies, which date back to her time in the state legislature, have long generated suspicion among some progressives, even as journalists have often painted her as part of the party\u2019s left wing. But Abrams surpassed expectations in a way that Democratic candidates who ran more left-leaning campaigns \u2014 like Florida\u2019s Andrew Gillum, Arizona\u2019s David Garcia and Maryland\u2019s Ben Jealous \u2014 weren\u2019t able to.\n\nOf course, her strategy isn\u2019t easily replicated. Jealous and Garcia were hammered by millions of dollars in attack ads from the Republican Governors Association, leaving them with little chance of success. But Abrams, a favorite of both the Democratic small-dollar donor base and the party\u2019s megadonors, had more than enough cash to invest in getting her message out, parrying GOP attacks and getting out her core voters.\n\nAbrams wasn\u2019t alone in this type of success. Other Democrats have pointed to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a more conservative Democrat, who used a similar strategy of investing big dollars in field and digital operations to turn out younger and more progressive voters while using television ads to reach across the aisle with messages focused on helping veterans and protecting Obamacare.\n\nAnd now New York Sen. Chuck Schumer hopes he can persuade Abrams to join Sinema in Congress\u2019 upper chamber. Schumer and Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto have met with Abrams, hoping to get her to challenge GOP Sen. David Perdue, a Trump favorite and former CEO who is running for a second term in 2020.\n\nThe ambitious Abrams, who famously used an Excel spreadsheet to plan out her life \u2015 including a 2028 presidential run \u2015 has always wanted to be governor of Georgia but isn\u2019t ruling out a Senate bid. Her team is in nearly constant contact with EMILY\u2019s List, which heavily backed her 2018 run. She has launched Fair Fight Georgia, a group that she said will \u201cwill pursue accountability in Georgia\u2019s elections and integrity in the process of maintaining our voting rolls.\u201d The group has already filed a major lawsuit against the state and aired a Super Bowl ad focused on voter rights.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are acting as if she\u2019s already a candidate. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has sent out press releases calling Fair Fight a \u201cpolitical slush fund.\u201d And the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a video attacking her before her State of the Union response.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/don-lemon-northam-trump_us_5c591b81e4b00187b554648d": "Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and President Donald Trump are evidently no strangers to scandal, but CNN\u2019s Don Lemon believes they\u2019ve got more in common than that.\n\nDuring his Monday night monologue, the anchor denounced the Democratic governor for ripping a page \u201cstraight out of the Trump playbook\u201d in handling his admitted use of blackface back in 1984.\n\nThe routine goes like this, Lemon said: \u201cJust double down, triple down, wait for the storm to pass, wait for the next big story to push this scandal out of the headlines.\u201d\n\nLast week, an image from the governor\u2019s medical school yearbook emerged, showing a man in blackface next to another in a Ku Klux Klan uniform.\n\nNortham first said he was in the photo, later changing his mind and denying he was one of the men pictured. However, he revealed that he had in fact worn blackface that same year as part of a Michael Jackson costume while participating in a dance contest.\n\n\u201cWhy would Governor Northman contradict what he\u2019d said less than 24 hours before?\u201d Lemon wondered.\n\nThen he answered his own question.\n\n\u201cIt does work,\u201d he said, recalling that \u201cit worked over and over and over\u201d when it came to Trump\u2019s self-defense after the infamous Access Hollywood tape surfaced in 2016, indicating he bragged about sexual assault in 2005.\n\nFirst, Trump offered a televised mea culpa, admitting to having uttered the predatory remarks, but two days later he walked that back, chalking it up to locker room talk. Eventually he began openly questioning the authenticity of the recording altogether.\n\nDespite the backlash just a month before the presidential election, he survived.\n\nAmid calls for Northam\u2019s resignation, the real debate, Lemon said, is whether the governor will survive, too.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-electability-beat-trump-2020_us_5c589812e4b087104756966f": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic voters are debating which of their potential primary candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, is in the best position to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic voters\u2019 singular goal in picking a presidential nominee in 2020 is the defeat of President Donald Trump, overriding ideological concerns and policy disagreements, according to a new poll released Monday.\n\nThe survey, conducted by New Jersey\u2019s Monmouth University, asked Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independent voters nationwide if they preferred a candidate with whom they agreed on most issues but who would have a hard time beating Trump or a candidate with whom they did not agree on most issues but who would be stronger against Trump. Fifty-six percent wanted the stronger candidate against Trump, even if they disagreed on most issues. Just 33 percent wanted a candidate whom they agreed with, even if that individual would struggle to defeat the president.\n\nThe finding is a shift from the electoral priorities expressed by both Democratic and Republican voters in 2016. But it matches what Democratic operatives across the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have been telling reporters for months.\n\n\u201cIn prior elections, voters from both parties consistently prioritized shared values over electability when selecting a nominee,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u201cIt looks like Democrats may be willing to flip that equation in 2020 because of their desire to defeat Trump. This is something to pay close attention to when primary voters really start tuning in to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: No consensus has developed among Democratic voters or party operatives over what type of candidate is best equipped to defeat Trump.\n\nShould it be a candidate who can win back the white working-class voters who defected to Trump in 2016? Then Democrats might want former Vice President Joe Biden, who is basing his potential candidacy around his appeal to that demographic. A candidate of color, like Texas\u2019 Juli\u00e1n Castro or California Sen. Kamala Harris, might be best equipped to win Republican-controlled Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona. Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have long argued that he would have won in 2016, and excitement around his policy platform could fire up working-class voters of all races.\n\nA report last month from Working America, an organizing group backed by the AFL-CIO, found \u201cwidespread anxiety and uncertainty about Democrats\u2019 prospects of defeating the president in 2020, and a lack of consensus on which candidate could best compete against Trump\u201d among working-class Democratic voters in Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe talk about electability was pervasive,\u201d Matt Morrison, Working America\u2019s executive director, told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThere was no clear consensus on what direction Democrats wanted to move in the presidential contest.\u201d\n\nContrast this focus on finding the most electable candidate with how people approached the 2016 election: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from shortly before the Iowa caucuses found just 16 percent of Democratic Party voters said choosing a candidate who could beat the GOP nominee was their top concern.\n\nElectability is already shaping early messaging on the 2020 primaries. For instance, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who both represent big cities on the East Coast, are playing up their rural roots, hoping to show Iowans they can win outside the most progressive parts of the country.\n\nThe consensus within both parties on who is electable and who isn\u2019t was torn apart by the results of the last presidential election, when Trump squeaked by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even as much of the GOP establishment predicted political doom. But while GOP primary voters seemingly responded to their party\u2019s presidential losses in 2008 and 2012 by throwing electability concerns out the window in 2016, Democratic primary voters in the 2018 midterms largely selected the same candidates that party bosses in Washington believed were most likely to win.\n\nThe Monmouth poll also found that 61 percent of Democratic women were willing to set aside their policy preferences to get a candidate capable of defeating the president, compared to just 45 percent of Democratic men.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-mocks-mccain-biden_us_5c5a315be4b0871047588d47": "At a preview lunch with broadcast news anchors ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump trashed his political rivals, including the late Sen.

The eliminated provision sat at the heart of the VRA: a formula requiring jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination to preclear their voting changes with the federal government.\n\nDemocrats have made voting rights a top priority since they won control of the House of Representatives in November, and the subcommittee Fudge is chairing is charged with compiling a record of discrimination that can be used to justify a new formula to require certain places to preclear their voting changes. Reinstating the preclearance provision would be a remarkably powerful legislative triumph, because in theory it would block discriminatory voting policies from going into effect. However, such a measure is unlikely to get support from Republicans, who control the Senate.\n\nBut Fudge\u2019s question on Monday underscored how Democrats, newly empowered in the House, are aggressively pushing back on allegations of fraud while also documenting the very real evidence of voter suppression in the United States.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) is chairing a subcommittee compiling evidence that can be used to reinstate a powerful provision of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAs Democrats build that record, they are working to expose specious allegations of voter fraud and demonstrate that a much larger problem is laws that make it more difficult for poor people and people of color to vote. After the Supreme Court reached its 2013 decision, states moved swiftly to implement voting restrictions that included measures like voter ID requirements and cuts to early voting.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing last month, Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) pressed J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department lawyer who has pushed misleading claims of voter fraud, about allegations of voter suppression in Georgia. Adams testified that \u201cit has never been easier to register to vote and to vote in America than it is in 2019,\u201d so Bass wanted to know if those claims of suppression were just made up.\n\nAdams said Brian Kemp, at the time Georgia\u2019s top election official, was acting within the law last year when he didn\u2019t recuse himself from overseeing his own race for governor, and that Kemp was exercising \u201creasonable list maintenance\u201d when he aggressively removed voters from the state rolls.\n\n\u201cYou call it reasonable list maintenance?\u201d Bass said. \u201cI think it\u2019s called voter suppression.\u201d\n\nYou call it reasonable list maintenance? I think it\u2019s called voter suppression. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) on Brian Kemp's purging of the Georgia voter rolls\n\nAdams did acknowledge it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d untrue to say people of color have encountered particular difficulty voting in some cases, although Bass moved to another speaker before he could go into detail.\n\nIn another exchange at the January hearing, Hans von Spakovsky, another former Justice Department lawyer who has made misleading fraud accusations, accused Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, of \u201cwildly exaggerating\u201d instances of voter suppression.\n\nThe comment prompted a strong response from Bass, who pointed to numerous examples of voter suppression that Ifill and Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, had just testified about.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said enough,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThe idea that we did not have problems in the 2018 election \u2015 the idea that all the testimony from Ms. Gupta and Ms. Ifill was just an exaggeration \u2015 is really an embarrassment. And I think people ought to be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky went on to argue that voter discrimination in the United States is \u201crare.\u201d He pointed to voter identification laws in Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina that allow someone to vote if they do not have an acceptable ID but have a \u201creasonable impediment.\u201d\n\nGupta and Ifill quickly pointed out inconsistencies in von Spakovsky\u2019s comments. Gupta noted that in 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit struck down the North Carolina law, saying it targeted African-Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d Ifill noted that the \u201creasonable impediment\u201d exceptions were only implemented after officials reached settlements in lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of testimony that I think is so disturbing, because it is so misleading,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of shading of the truth, shading of the reality of what it takes for lawyers and communities to challenge discriminatory voting practices.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-governor-abbott-voter-citizen-probe_us_5c53a199e4b01d3c1f11f4d3": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2015 A statewide investigation that cast scrutiny on nearly 100,000 suspected noncitizen voters continued to unravel Thursday as more county officials revealed the state\u2019s lists were filled with legitimate voters and critics demanded that the Republican leadership halt the process.\n\nBut Gov. Greg Abbott is still defending his state\u2019s decision, describing it as a legitimate effort to curb illegal voting.\n\n\u201cThis is what you would categorize as a process,\u201d Abbott said at a press conference Thursday morning, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s important to let the data speak for itself.\u201d\n\nSo far, the data indicate that state leaders jumped the gun.\n\nA List Riddled With False Positives\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, middle, isn't worried about his state's disastrous citizenship probe.\n\nTexas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) issued a statement Friday saying his office had identified about 95,000 noncitizens who had registered to vote, including about 58,000 who had cast a ballot at some time over the last two decades. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton echoed the announcement, tagging it on Twitter with the words \u201cVOTER FRAUD ALERT.\u201d By Sunday, President Donald Trump added to the uproar, baselessly calling it the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d and demanding \u201cstrong voter ID\u201d \u2015 despite the fact that Texas already requires photo ID to cast a ballot.\n\nCritics and legal groups contested the allegations, noting that the state had culled the list primarily by checking voter registration records against those maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards. That agency belongs to the state and doesn\u2019t keep updated citizenship records \u2015 it only requires proof of citizenship when people apply for state IDs. That leaves open the possibility that people who naturalized after obtaining or renewing their identification cards would still be flagged.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. With each passing day, it becomes clearer that the secretary of state\u2019s list is riddled with tens of thousands of false positives.\n\nThe office has made lurching and inconsistent steps to solve the problem it created. On Monday, facing a storm of criticism, the secretary of state\u2019s office recalculated the list of suspected noncitizen voters, arriving at a higher figure of 98,000. But a day later, it backtracked, quietly notifying county registrars that thousands of the people named were in fact citizens, the Texas Tribune first reported.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office did not respond to a request for an updated list. But Harris County, which encompasses Texas\u2019s largest city of Houston, so far has struck nearly two-thirds of the 29,341 names from its list of suspected noncitizen voters because they turned out to be citizens, according to County Attorney Douglas Ray. The list also included about 400 duplicates.\n\nThe list sent to El Paso County included a naturalized citizen who works at that county office, election official Lisa Wise told HuffPost. In McLennan County, home to the city of Waco, every one of the 366 original names turned out to be a falsely flagged U.S. citizen, the Waco Tribune-Herald reported.\n\nAnd Galveston County sent out letters this week to 163 suspected noncitizen voters, giving them 30 days to provide proof of citizenship \u2015 only to discover before receiving responses that at least 58 of them were incorrectly identified by the secretary of state\u2019s office. In those 58 cases, county officials sent new letters telling the voters to disregard the first one.\n\nRequests For Information Met With Crickets\n\nBoth the Mexican American Legislative Caucus and a coalition of legal and activist groups demanded that the Republican leadership of Texas rescind the list, without success. The League of United Latin American Citizens filed a federal lawsuit to block the probe Tuesday, and other legal groups are considering litigation.\n\nDemocratic state lawmakers have also used legislative privilege to demand more information about how the secretary of state\u2019s office came up with the list. Those requests are typically filled within a couple of days, but the office has yet to comply, state Rep. Celia Israel (D-Austin) told HuffPost.\n\nThe state\u2019s House Committee on Elections will likely call Whitley to testify within the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to the secretary of state in a public forum and the attorney general, and his staff, and say: How did you cook this idea up?\u201d Israel said. \u201cWhere did it come from? There seems to be some synchronicity to how you guys are messaging.\u201d\n\nIsrael noted that she and her chief of staff met with Whitley the day before he announced the voter probe. But he failed to mention that it was coming.\n\nThe voter investigation came three months after the midterm elections, which saw major gains for Democrats in a majority-minority state where Republicans have long held firm control, despite their demographic disadvantage. Because the historically low Latino voter turnout rate has favored Republicans, critics have viewed the probe as a political stunt aimed at making naturalized citizens fearful of registering to vote.\n\nSome 78 percent of the 98,000 suspected noncitizen voters identified by the Texas Secretary of State in Monday\u2019s list live in counties that voted Democrat in the 2018 U.S. Senate election.\n\nAs the slow-moving debacle over the suspected noncitizen voter probe moves forward with the governor\u2019s blessing, naturalized citizens across the state are left wondering if their voter registrations will be questioned before the next election deadline on April 6.\n\nNaturalized Citizens Left In Limbo\n\nMar\u00eda Garc\u00eda was born in Durango, Mexico, but has lived in the United States since she was 3 months old. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen last May \u2015 in time to cast her first ballot in November\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI was super excited, but I was also very nervous,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how fast the system picks up on the registration. I had tried to confirm \u2015 I was checking on the site every day. When I showed up at the polling booth, I had the little receipt that you get. I had any type of documentation they would possibly ask for.\u201d\n\nWith the deadline to register for the next Texas election only three months away, she now worries that the state\u2019s faulty probe might leave her sitting out the next election \u2015 not only because she is recently naturalized but also because her name might get confused with someone else\u2019s.\n\nI know there are other people who might receive these letters and might receive these calls, and they\u2019ll think they did something wrong and they\u2019ll be scared to vote again. Julieta Garibay, naturalized citizen flagged in Texas voter probe\n\n\u201cMy name is Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, which is the most Latino name to have,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that going to put me at risk for the next elections coming up? We have mayoral elections in Dallas coming up and local positions that are important to me.\u201d\n\nJulieta Garibay of Austin also voted for the first time last year after naturalizing. Fearing the secretary of state might have flagged her, she sent an email to the Travis County voter registrar.\n\nBy Wednesday she got the answer. A county election official called to confirm the list included her name. The official didn\u2019t ask whether Garibay was a citizen.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the county is contesting her registration. Officials in Travis County have already struck 634 people from the list of 4,558 suspected noncitizen voters provided by the state and are investigating further, spokeswoman Tiffany Seward said. Officials aren\u2019t contacting voters about the list yet unless they ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling really mad,\u201d Garibay told HuffPost. \u201cI know there are other people who might receive these letters and might receive these calls, and they\u2019ll think they did something wrong and they\u2019ll be scared to vote again.\u201d\n\nSam Levine contributed reporting.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stacey-abrams-state-of-the-union-democratic-response_us_5c5a36dae4b00187b5560cdf": "WASHINGTON \u2015 In the official Democratic response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, former Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams delivered a passionate speech about the need for economic and social justice in America and said even though she disagrees with Trump on virtually everything, she still wants him to succeed.\n\n\u201cMy reason for running for governor was simple: I love our country and its promise of opportunity for all,\u201d Abrams said, beaming against the blurred backdrop of a group of men and women of different races. \u201cI stand here tonight because I hold fast to my father\u2019s credo: Together, we are coming for America, for a better America.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who is the first black woman to give a Democratic response to the State of the Union, denounced the president\u2019s policies on immigration, LGBTQ rights, gun safety, education and health care. She didn\u2019t need to name the president directly when she urged Americans to hold people \u201cin the very highest offices\u201d accountable for racism. But she did call Trump out directly for shutting down the government last month, making federal workers go without pay for weeks in his push for border wall money.\n\n\u201cMaking their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cThe shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values.\u201d\n\nStill, Abrams extended an olive branch to Trump, urging him to consider how much Democrats and Republicans can accomplish by working together.\n\n\u201cEven as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems, I still don\u2019t want him to fail,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America.\u201d\n\nEven as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems, I still don\u2019t want him to fail. Stacey Abrams\n\nFor all the potential of America, Abrams said, nothing is possible without \u201cthe bedrock guarantee\u201d of people\u2019s right to vote.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Voter suppression is real,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe issue is personal for her. Abrams lost her governor\u2019s race in November to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) amid allegations of voter suppression. Kemp refused to recuse himself as the state\u2019s top election official in his own election, which many said was a conflict of interest. He also faced scrutiny after his office placed 53,000 voters\u2019 registrations in suspense because their names didn\u2019t exactly match a state record. Nearly 70 percent of the people on the list were black.\n\nAbrams included a call to fight for voting rights in Tuesday night\u2019s response and took a shot at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recently called a group of proposed voting reforms in Democratic legislation a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a \u2018power grab,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders \u2015 not where politicians pick their voters.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Abrams said, the American promise stems from basic family values like the ones she grew up with as her family fluctuated between being lower middle class and working poor. She talked about her parents coming home from work \u201cweary and bone-tired\u201d but still showing her and her siblings all that they could be.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/samamtha-bee-roger-stone-banksy_us_5c52b6b9e4b093663f5b4a89": "Samantha Bee on Wednesday set about busting the mythology that outlandish GOP operative Roger Stone has tried to create around himself.\n\n\u201cFor decades, Stone has proclaimed himself a political genius, a high-powered trickster merrily owning the libs, a sort of Republican Banksy,\u201d explained the host of \u201cFull Frontal.\u201d\n\nBut Bee then detailed why Stone, a longtime associate of President Donald Trump, \u201cis not a super villain or a gangster.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just shows up whenever things are getting dirty,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s more like America\u2019s athlete\u2019s foot.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Stone pleaded not guilty to a slew of charges in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible Trump campaign collusion.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kellyanne-conway-cory-booker_us_5c549e61e4b09293b203f80a": "Kellyanne Conway on Friday suggested Sen.

Greg Abbott, Secretary of State David Whitley and Attorney General Ken Paxton \u2015 and seeks damages if a judge finds that their alleged conspiracy violates the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought on behalf of several Texas voters and three organizations that run voter registration projects, is the latest in a string of legal challenges seeking to overturn a controversial voter probe that Republican leaders cite as evidence of voter fraud, but critics deride as a thinly veiled attempt to suppress the vote of naturalized citizens, who are overwhelmingly of Latin American or Asian birth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear as the purge effort has unraveled over the course of a week and the state officials have refused to withdraw the purge list that their real intentions are not related to maintaining the integrity of the voter rolls,\u201d MALDEF attorney Nina Perales told HuffPost, \u201cbut instead are to take eligible voters off the rolls and intimidate naturalized citizens from voting.\u201d\n\nGetty Editorial Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had called the list evidence of serious voter fraud.\n\nThe MALDEF lawsuit also alleges that the state\u2019s Republican leadership violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause and two Voting Rights Act provisions \u2015 one that bars officials from imposing different voter registration standards for different groups and another that prohibits them from racial discrimination.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Whitley announced that his office had identified some 95,000 suspected noncitizen voters, including 58,000 who had cast a ballot over the last two decades, by checking voter registrations against Department of Public Safety records. The secretary of state then distributed the list to county voter registrars, asking them to send letters verifying those voters\u2019 citizenship by sending a letter asking them to provide proof. Those who fail to respond in 30 days would be scrubbed from the rolls.\n\nPaxton, the attorney general, trumpeted the news the same Friday it was released, calling it evidence of voter fraud. Abbott echoed the sentiment and called for the state Legislature to enact stricter requirements for Texans to register to vote. The issue gained national attention on Sunday when President Donald Trump repeated the claims of voter fraud from his Twitter account, stating them as fact.\n\nBut the list generated by the secretary of state did not provide evidence of a single case of voter fraud, let alone a broad trend involving nearly 100,000 people. DPS, the agency that issues driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, doesn\u2019t keep up-to-date citizenship records, leaving open the possibility that people who obtained a driver\u2019s license before naturalizing as U.S. citizens and registering to vote would get flagged by the state\u2019s probe.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what has happened. Over the course of the week, the secretary of state\u2019s office itself contacted county officials to tell them to disregard tens of thousands of names that state officials had determined within days were actually citizens. The flaws in the process weren\u2019t limited to flagging citizens who naturalized after taking out a state ID \u2015 Harris County, which encompasses Houston, struck some 400 duplicates off its list.\n\nDemocrats characterize the crackdown on suspected noncitizen voting as an attempt to suppress the vote after a midterm election that saw Hispanic turnout skyrocket. Democratic members of the state Legislature, along with more than a dozen civil rights groups, have demanded that Abbott rescind the probe, without success.\n\nIt\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority of people on this list are citizens eligible to vote. Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center\n\nSome 78 percent of those flagged in the secretary of state\u2019s list live in counties that voted Democratic in the 2018 U.S. Senate election.\n\nLegal challenges have been quick to mount. The League of United Latin American Citizens, a Hispanic civic group, sued to block the voter probe Tuesday, alleging that it amounted to voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based nonprofit, joined the LULAC lawsuit Friday, filing an amended class action complaint to the earlier lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Antonio on behalf of Julie Hilberg, a 54-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in the United Kingdom.\n\nHilberg, who lives south of San Antonio in Atascosa County, registered to vote in 2015 and cast her first ballot in the following year\u2019s presidential election. She found that she was on the voter probe list after asking the county registrar, according to CLC attorney Paul Smith.\n\n\u201cThis program is a gratuitous attack on people\u2019s right to vote that has no factual basis,\u201d Smith told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority of people on this list are citizens eligible to vote, but they\u2019re going to get this notice saying they have 30 days to prove their citizenship. It\u2019s inevitable that some of them won\u2019t and they\u2019ll get purged.\u201d\n\nThe amended complaint filed on Hilberg\u2019s behalf Friday also accuses Whitley and Paxton of violating her First Amendment right to the vote as a form of self expression and 14th Amendment right to cast a ballot freely, calling the voter probe an \u201cunconstitutional voter purge.\u201d\n\nPaxton said he welcomed the opportunity to defend the probe after he was first sued on Tuesday. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the amended complaint.\n\nEven as the Republican-led probe unraveled, Abbott praised his administration\u2019s efforts, describing the crackdown launched by the secretary of state\u2019s office as a \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\nRepublican state legislators have also filed bills in both chambers that would codify the flawed process for identifying suspected noncitizen voters and require the secretary of state\u2019s office to perform the checks annually.\n\nBut any process requiring the state to use state driving agency records to verify voter registrations would also surely invite a federal lawsuit, according to Smith.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ralph-northam_us_5c567c92e4b09293b204c5b5": "President Donald Trump called Virginia Gov.

Sen. Ted Cruz listens.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 One week into the three-week negotiating period before another possible government shutdown, President Donald Trump yet again demanded that lawmakers give him billions of dollars for a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nHe also hinted that he would declare a national emergency if they did not.\n\nAll while simultaneously claiming \u2015 falsely \u2015 that he has already built and is currently building \u201ca lot\u201d of the wall.\n\nSo went the latest twists Thursday in Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to get U.S. taxpayers to provide the money for a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall that he promised hundreds of times during his campaign he would force Mexico to pay for.\n\n\u201cThere is no wall going up,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential primaries. \u201cSo the only thing to conclude is that Trump is building a fake wall with fake pesos to stop fake caravans to prevent a fake border crisis for which he will declare another fake victory.\u201d\n\nThe president triggered a 35-day government shutdown just before Christmas over the refusal by the then wholly Republican-led Congress to appropriate billions of taxpayer dollars for his signature campaign promise.\n\nA week ago, he signed the exact short-term spending deal \u2015 with no wall money \u2015 that he said he would not sign in December. On Thursday, he said he did so to help the 800,000 federal workers who already had missed a month of pay. He claimed, without evidence, that \u201cmany\u201d of them had wanted him to continue the shutdown to get wall money.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to do it because people were getting hurt,\u201d Trump told reporters following an Oval Office photo opportunity.\n\nHe added that the shutdown had great value because it focused attention on the wall and illegal immigration. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do the shutdown, people wouldn\u2019t know, people wouldn\u2019t understand the subject,\u201d the president said. \u201cNow they understand the subject. They understand what a humanitarian crisis it is.\u201d\n\nThe fact of the matter was it\u2019s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants. A former Trump campaign official, on the president's criticism of the former House speaker\n\nTrump has taken to blaming former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan for failing to get him funds for a wall during Trump\u2019s first two years in the White House, when his own party controlled both chambers of Congress. \u201cI was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed,\u201d he told the conservative website Daily Caller.\n\nBut one former Trump campaign official said the president failed to take advantage of his first-year power when he had it. \u201cThe fact of the matter was it\u2019s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nNow, with the House under the control of Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is facing vocal opposition to his wall rather than just passive resistance. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday, but allowed that she is open to some new barriers in some areas as well as money for better technical monitoring. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nTrump made illegal immigration and caravans of asylum-seekers heading to the border the centerpiece of his midterm election message last year. In speech after speech, he told audiences at his rallies and those watching at home that the migrants would bring crime and drugs and that Pelosi wanted \u201copen borders\u201d and would welcome those people in.\n\nDespite his efforts \u2015 and in some congressional districts, because of them \u2015 Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House. Meanwhile, Republicans, although they had the most favorable Senate election map in decades, picked up only two seats in that chamber.\n\nAs a Dec. 21 government funding deadline approached, Trump resumed talking about caravans and immigrants coming to commit crimes \u2015 including one particularly lurid but apparently apocryphal description of kidnapped women being bound and gagged with duct tape as they\u2019re smuggled across the border.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters that he doubted the House and Senate conference committee negotiators working on a new Department of Homeland Security funding bill would include money for his wall. He acknowledged that he might yet declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d which he believes would let him transfer money from other executive agency accounts to build the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting till Feb. 15,\u201d Trump said, referring to the next shutdown deadline. \u201cOn Feb. 15, the committee will come back. And if they don\u2019t have a wall, I don\u2019t even want to waste my time reading what they have.\u201d\n\nMedia reports from when Trump previously threatened to declare an emergency noted that he was thinking of raiding billions of dollars from the Defense Department\u2019s Army Corps of Engineers budget to repair hurricane damage in places like Puerto Rico and Houston.\n\n\u201cThose are not great ideas,\u201d said Michael Steel, once a top aide to then GOP House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nSteel added that since Democrats seem willing to agree to money for some new physical barriers, he did not fully understand talk about an emergency or another shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-democrats-congress_us_5c5a04e2e4b087104758714e": "Andrew Harnik/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is expected to release a resolution outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal as early as this week.\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) are expected to release this week includes language about spurring similar efforts abroad, setting the stage for a debate on how climate change fits into Democrats\u2019 foreign policy visions.\n\nThe resolution calls for the United States to \u201cpromote the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services with the aim to reclaim U.S. leadership on climate change to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal,\u201d multiple sources who have seen the document confirmed to HuffPost.\n\nThe line isn\u2019t completely new. During the fight to establish a select committee on the Green New Deal in the U.S. House late last year, proponents of the policy drafted an 11-page document outlining goals that included making the United States \u201cthe undisputed international leader in \u2026 bringing about a global Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nBut its inclusion in the first formal effort to push a Green New Deal through Congress could spark fresh debate over how central climate change should be to a progressive foreign policy program as more Democrats declare their candidacy for president in 2020. It offers Democrats a counter-argument to President Donald Trump\u2019s stance that global efforts to deal with climate change disadvantage the United States, and it takes account of how domestic changes as sweeping as what\u2019s proposed under a Green New Deal will affect other countries.\n\n\u201cIf you look at historical precedents like the Marshall Plan, it\u2019s really exciting to start thinking about how climate can be centered in a more progressive vision of foreign policy,\u201d Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst at 350.org, said by phone. \u201cThinking of a Green New Deal, not just as strictly domestic policy but as a pillar of American foreign policy, becomes a really evocative ... idea.\u201d\n\nCorbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Markey did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A woman carries building materials at a construction site in the morning smog near New Delhi, India.\n\nForeign policy remains one of the big, unanswered questions about how a serious effort to decarbonize the world\u2019s largest economy would look. Despite his historic efforts to forge the Paris Agreement in 2015, President Barack Obama pledged only $3 billion to a United Nations fund to help poor countries, those whose energy development could determine how bad climate change gets, build cleaner energy infrastructure. When Trump announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017, he canceled payments on the outstanding $2 billion. Some say the unabated push for new coal-fired plants in countries such as Vietnam, for example, reflects the absence of American soft power pushing for cleaner alternatives.\n\nBut there are even bigger implications to decarbonization. Oil- and gas-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia command outsize influence on the world stage in large part due to their control over the global supply of fossil fuels. Entire economies, such as that of Equatorial Guinea, are built around oil fields controlled by U.S.-based giants. And just a handful of small countries are on track to meet the already-lackluster emission reduction goals agreed to in the Paris accords.\n\n\u201cIf you are thinking about a battle of geopolitical dominance between Russia and China and the United States, you need to understand how these energy tools play into our ability to maintain influence,\u201d said Greg Carlock, who authored the think tank Data for Progress\u2019s blueprint for a Green New Deal back in September.\n\nThe progressive wing of the Democratic Party has long struggled to articulate a clear foreign policy vision, much less one that incorporates climate change as an issue. The topics were largely absent from the 2016 presidential primary, during which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) forced a leftward thrust on a slate of domestic policy issues.\n\nIf you look at historical precedents like the Marshall Plan, it\u2019s really exciting to start thinking about how climate can be centered in a more progressive vision of foreign policy.

But it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nBut in recent months, Sanders, who is widely expected to once again declare his candidacy for the White House, has begun \u201cquietly remaking the Democrats\u2019 foreign policy,\u201d as Politico reported in October. In November, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who ended last year announcing an exploratory committee for a presidential run, laid out a foreign policy vision tied to her own anti-corruption efforts.

Last month, Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary-general of the United Nations, endorsed Democrats\u2019 push for a Green New Deal, calling it \u201ca very, very good initiative.\u201d\n\nBut the resolution due out this week could offer progressive and even some mainstream Democrats a North Star as they navigate complicated questions of climate change and foreign policy going into the next election.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-president-run-2020_us_5c3fd648e4b0a8dbe16d7add": "Democratic Sen.

The surprise troop announcements also alarmed Republicans on Capitol Hill, who managed to convince Trump to delay the pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria for several months to ensure a slow and orderly withdrawal.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted 68-23 to advance an amendment offered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a key Trump ally, that expressed the sense of the chamber that the U.S. \u201cfaces continuing threats from terrorist groups operating in Syria and Afghanistan\u201d and that the \u201cprecipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.\u201d\n\nWhile the amendment is a nonbinding provision without the force of law, it sent a clear message to the White House that any plans to immediately pull troops out of war zones could jeopardize the fight against groups like the so-called Islamic State, leave Kurdish allies on the ground defenseless, and embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran.\n\nWhether to withdraw from the conflicts could become a big issue in the coming Democratic presidential primary, however. Many likely or declared candidates have struggled to voice a clear position on Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves in the Middle East.\n\nThe vote to advance McConnell\u2019s amendment took place just a day after Trump called the heads of his own intelligence agencies \u201cnaive\u201d on Twitter for contradicting him about the threats North Korea and the Islamic State pose to the U.S. The tweet came after Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel testified on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Intelligence should go back to school,\u201d Trump said in the tweet on Wednesday, which is only the latest example of him ridiculing and refusing to take advice from his own top national security advisers.\n\nTrump\u2019s public broadsides against the intelligence community \u2015 which follows his denials about the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessments regarding the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 presidential election \u2015 irked GOP leadership in the Senate this week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you can say this but I prefer the president would stay off Twitter \u2014 particularly with regard to these important national security issues,\u201d Sen.

The Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) would allow workers to form unions by rounding up a majority of signatures in their workplace \u2015 a process known as \u201ccard check\u201d \u2015 thereby avoiding a secret-ballot election and any anti-union campaign from management. Business groups feared a wave of unionization if the law passed.\n\nSo in stepped Schultz, then the chief executive of Starbucks, along with the CEOs of Whole Foods and Costco. Billed as a deal to satisfy both unions and employers, the Schultz proposal would streamline union elections and ramp up penalties for illegal union-busting. But it would also get rid of the card check measure, which was at the heart of the reform, and toss out a major provision making it easier for unionized workers to secure their first collective bargaining agreement.\n\nSchultz said his aim was to offer \u201ca voice of reason.\u201d But to those hoping to reverse the steady drop in union membership in the U.S., his plan didn\u2019t seem like much of a compromise at all.\n\n\u201cI remember it was like someone was trying to be extremely unhelpful,\u201d recalled Jody Calemine, a Democratic staffer on the House labor committee at the time. \u201cIt went over like a lead balloon. People quickly went back to trying to figure this out.\u201d\n\nEFCA never made it into law \u2015 several moderate Democrats wouldn\u2019t get on board with the card-check measure \u2015 and Schultz\u2019s involvement probably had minimal impact on its fate. But with the billionaire now testing the waters for a presidential run as an independent, hoping to win over middle-of-the-road voters dissatisfied with both parties, the episode says plenty about how he fashions himself a benevolent executive and man of compromise.\n\nSchultz was touting his EFCA alternative as a \u201cthird way\u201d to bridge a divide between two intractable sides. But in reality, his idea would have simply preserved a system in which it was harder for workers to join unions \u2015 a system that benefited Starbucks and Schultz.\n\n\u201cI think the proposal reflects a penchant for wanting to maintain the status quo, maintain his power and his ability as a CEO to decide what\u2019s best for working people,\u201d said Calemine, who\u2019s now general counsel at the Communications Workers of America union.\n\nHe told people if they got rid of the union\u2026 they would do better. Dave Schmitz, former union official\n\nStarbucks has long enjoyed a reputation as an enlightened employer. While the coffee chain pays the lower wages typical of the food-and-service sector, news stories have praised the company and Schultz, its longtime CEO who stepped down last year, for offering stock grants, tuition reimbursement and a health insurance plan to hourly employees. But beneath those progressive trappings there often was a conservative antipathy to collective bargaining by workers.\n\nErin McPike, a spokeswoman for Schultz, said the former CEO believes unions \u201chave played a critical role where companies have fallen short.\u201d But in the case of Starbucks, \u201cthere was not a need for a union because what he was offering was always superior.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe strongly believes companies have a deep and abiding responsibility to take care of all their people,\u201d she said.\n\nIf Schultz seemed eager to torpedo the EFCA reforms, it may have been because his company had been battling unions for years. The Seattle-based chain\u2019s Washington roastery and a half-dozen of its first stores were unionized in the 1980\u2019s by the United Food and Commercial Workers union. There were maybe 120 Starbucks union members back then, estimates Dave Schmitz, who was head of organizing at UFCW Local 1001 at the time.\n\nIn his 1999 memoir, \u201cPour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built A Company One Cup At A Time,\u201d Schultz recounted how he viewed the union as unnecessary \u2015 and even an affront to his management: \u201cI was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn\u2019t need a union.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schultz, a college student and Starbucks employee began a decertification campaign aimed at ousting the union in 1987 \u2015 a move Schultz wrote of approvingly. A majority of store workers eventually signed on. The roasting plant workers decertified their union five years later, according to the book.\n\nSchmitz said the former CEO\u2019s account fails to convey just how much Schultz worked against the union. According to Schmitz, as the parties negotiated over a second contract, Starbucks\u2019 lawyers tried to reduce workers\u2019 health benefits and strip out their right to \u201cjust cause,\u201d a standard provision in union contracts that protects workers from arbitrary firings. He said the company also wanted the right to change working conditions without consulting the union.\n\nSchmitz still has a leaflet his union created to pass out in Chicago as the company expanded there, accusing Starbucks of not negotiating in good faith.\n\n\u201cHe told people if they got rid of the union\u2026 they would do better,\u201d recalled Schmitz, who\u2019s now retired.\n\nSchultz viewed the union\u2019s expulsion as a sign Starbucks was primed for growth across the U.S. and beyond: \u201cOnce I had their full support, I knew I could count on them to work as a team and imbue them with the enthusiasm they would need to spread the word about Starbucks coffee around the world.\u201d\n\nDave Schmitz A leaflet passed out in Chicago, circa 1987, as Starbucks expanded there.\n\nStarbucks faced another major union campaign beginning in 2004, when the company was on its way to growing beyond 10,000 locations around the world. The Industrial Workers of the World, a union outside the mainstream labor establishment in the U.S., launched a grassroots organizing effort dubbed the Starbucks Workers Union in a handful of cities. The group wanted to prove it was possible to unionize workers in the all but union-free world of fast food.\n\nDaniel Gross was among the Starbucks employees in New York who soon filed a petition for a union election, seeking higher wages and more stable work hours.\n\n\u201cThe very first response that we got from the company was a company-wide voicemail, which management transcribed and posted in stores,\u201d recalled Gross, who is now the executive director of the labor group Brandworkers. \u201cIt was a message from Howard Schultz, telling us how disturbed and disappointed he was that this group of baristas at a store in New York had decided to form a union.\u201d\n\nThe union election never happened \u2015 the employees eventually withdrew their petition \u2015 but the work of the Starbucks Workers Union led to a slew of cases before the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that referees disputes between unions and employers. Testimony revealed that Starbucks corporate executives coordinated a response to the organizing efforts, conducting interviews with employees to determine if they were union supporters. When a store with union sympathies had openings, the company transferred \u201cpro-Starbucks\u201d workers there instead of hiring unknowns.\n\nAn administrative law judge ruled in 2008 that several of the company\u2019s tactics ran afoul of the law, including discriminating against pro-union workers and forbidding employees from discussing the union inside the store even though they could talk about other non-work issues. The same judge ruled that Starbucks illegally fired Gross for his union advocacy, forcing the company to rehire him with back pay. A federal judge reversed that ruling on appeal years later, saying the firing was related to work performance.\n\n[Schultz] is very adept at selling himself as this benevolent patriarch. Erik Forman, former Starbucks union activist\n\nErik Forman also claimed to have been fired for his activism. He filed a complaint against the company and was rehired. He said he worked for Starbucks in the Minneapolis area for roughly five years, eventually getting treated for tendonitis due to the repetitive work of making lattes. He thought a union could help workers secure better schedules, noting the company was infamous for \u201cclopenings\u201d \u2015 workers having to close down the store at night then reopen it just a few hours later the next day.\n\nThe practice became widely known after a 2014 New York Times story profiled a Starbucks barista and single mother who struggled to weave her life around her erratic work schedule. The article prompted Starbucks to say it would change its scheduling policies throughout its stores.\n\n\u201c[Schultz] is very adept at selling himself as this benevolent patriarch, when in reality the company he built runs on the same model of fast-food exploitation as all of its competitors,\u201d said Forman, who\u2019s now an adjunct professor at SUNY Empire State College.\n\nSchultz\u2019s view of collective bargaining doesn\u2019t appear to have changed much since the Starbucks union in Washington state was decertified some 30 years ago. In an interview to discuss his possible White House campaign on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Wednesday, Schultz was asked what he would do to rebuild unions in the U.S. as a way to reduce income inequality. He said trying to reform the tax code would make more sense.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-anti-war-campaign-donations_us_5c530708e4b093663f5bfa69": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is pitching herself as Democrats\u2019 top anti-war voice and a serious progressive in her bid for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. But even as she spent years decrying American military interventions abroad and money\u2019s role in politics, as a congresswoman she accepted donations worth more than $100,000 from the country\u2019s biggest producers of bombs, planes and weapons systems.\n\nRegular contributions from companies including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and BAE Systems poured in between 2012 (the year she was first elected) and 2016, according to a HuffPost review of donations to Gabbard\u2019s campaign account and political action committee. (Federal Election Commission filings for the two organizations are publicly available and organized by the Center for Responsive Politics.)\n\nThe congresswoman said in May 2017 that she had \u201crecently\u201d stopped accepting money from the defense industry and would no longer accept political action committee largesse. Her total income from the arms industry by that point had hit $111,500, with weapons producers Boeing and Lockheed Martin featuring as her ninth and 12th biggest donors, respectively, in the 2016 election cycle. (Firms cannot directly donate to candidates; the figures reported are those from the weapons companies\u2019 political action committees, funded by their employees.)\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is pitching herself as Democrats\u2019 top anti-war voice and a serious progressive in her bid for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. But as a congresswoman, she accepted donations worth more than $100,000 from the country\u2019s biggest producers of bombs, planes and weapons systems.\n\nOf course, those kinds of companies donate widely across the political spectrum, and it makes sense that they would be especially interested in supporting Gabbard: She\u2019s a military veteran and serves on the House Armed Services Committee. But the connection is striking given her posturing as the ideal champion of a progressive alternative to traditional U.S. foreign policy for an increasingly left-leaning Democratic Party and a war-weary general public.\n\nGabbard has become well-known for frequently blasting political leaders of both parties over their support for militaristic moves like the invasion of Iraq and has defended Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as a victim of American bullying and subterfuge.\n\n\u201cEvery time we launch these interventionist regime-change wars, it is not only our veterans who pay the price for that,\u201d Gabbard said in her campaign launch video released on Jan. 24. \u201cEvery single one of us pays the price. We have spent trillions of your taxpayer dollars to pay for these wars, taking those dollars away from our communities and our people who need them right here at home.\u201d\n\nBut her relationship to defense industry donors shows there\u2019s more to crafting a more humane and restrained U.S. foreign policy than calling out instances of saber-rattling. And what those donors appear to know is that her selective callouts don\u2019t necessarily stem from dovishness.\n\nGabbard calls herself \u201ca hawk\u201d when it comes to what she identifies as threats to the U.S. She supports the use of drones (a prime product for the arms industry) in counterterrorism, the deployment of special operations in countries that aren\u2019t officially at war with America, and Russia\u2019s often brutal bombing campaign in support of Assad.\n\nShe\u2019s keen to bolster the U.S. military \u2015 the chief customer of the weapons companies who have donated to her \u2015 and she has criticized fellow Democrats, notably former President Barack Obama, for not being tough enough abroad; she initially rejected the Iran nuclear deal and frequently alleged that the Obama administration was enabling terrorists in Syria by providing support to the communities who oppose Assad.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabbard has pushed the kinds of narratives about foreigners that create public acceptability for the idea of an aggressive America armed to the teeth.\n\nTerrorism is a product of a version of Islam, she has repeatedly said. She justified voting with the GOP to make it harder for refugees, particularly from Syria, to come to the U.S. by claiming vetting processes were clearly flawed (despite research showing it\u2019s almost unheard-of for refugees to be involved in terror) and reiterating that the real problem was America\u2019s push against Assad. And she has cultivated associations with the hard-right governments of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, both of which broadly treat Muslim communities numbering in the millions as security threats to be tightly managed \u2015 with the kind of resources America\u2019s defense industry is happy to provide.\n\nTwo spokespeople for Gabbard did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-cory-booker-articulate_us_5c548d9ce4b09293b203d6b8": "Chris Christie may have thought he was paying Sen.

The shift supervisor felt similarly about the written instructions, finding it frustrating that Schultz was able to publicly discuss his politics when he worked at Starbucks while they were not.\n\n\u201c[I wish] we would be given the same opportunity to express our beliefs,\u201d the supervisor said.\n\nThe instructions came as part of a larger section in the weekly update about Schultz\u2019s new book, From the Ground Up, which the former CEO said in a note to the company is about \u201cOur Mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote it about you, and for you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that From the Ground Up makes you proud to be part of a company that is about so much more than coffee. It\u2019s about finding new ways to balance profit and a social conscience.\u201d\n\nSchultz stepped away from Starbucks last summer after more than three decades of building the company into a global powerhouse. At the time, he said, \u201cOne of the things I want to do in my next chapter is to figure out if there is a role I can play in giving back.\u201d\n\nNow, Schultz is publicly weighing an independent presidential bid as he tours the country promoting his new book. His potential run has already provoked condemnation from Democrats who fear he could split voters and pave the way for President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020. Hecklers interrupted Schultz\u2019s Manhattan book event twice on Monday, one of them yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire asshole!\u201d\n\nSome Starbucks employees feel the same way.\n\n\u201cI find Schultz running to be extremely awful,\u201d said a third Starbucks employee, who asked not to be named because he relies on the job for health insurance. \u201cI just know he\u2019ll splinter the Dem vote in 2020 and that he\u2019s in it for himself.\u201d\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Scott Pelley asked Schultz whether Starbucks stores would play a role in his campaign should he run: \u201cIs there going to be a Schultz 2020 button on every green apron across the country?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d Schultz responded. \u201cThere would be a complete separation between me and the company.\u201d\n\nBut that separation has yet to occur. Starbucks noted in its employee update that it had shipped \u201cone copy [of Schultz\u2019s new book] to each of our U.S. stores this week for partners to share\u201d and that employees would get a 50 percent discount on the book through Jan. 27 as part of a \u201cpartner-only presale.\u201d\n\nThe third Starbucks employee told HuffPost that another one of Schultz\u2019s books, Onward: How Starbucks Fought For Its Life Without Losing Its Soul, is currently \u201cin our stores over the work computer.\u201d\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson noted that the company has been sending books to stores since 2007 \u2015 two recent examples being Dare to Lead by Brene Brown and A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah.\n\nThe coffee chain has already dealt with Schultz\u2019s potential foray into politics in other ways. One day after Schultz\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment, current Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson noted in an open letter to employees that while people will \u201cinevitably\u201d ask \u201cif the company supports a possible presidential candidacy of Howard,\u201d \u201cwe don\u2019t get involved in national political campaigns.\u201d\n\nAll Starbucks employees have \u201can opportunity to make our own informed decisions about politics and the future of our communities and our country,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cAnd as Starbucks partners, we have a responsibility to always recognize and respect the diversity of perspectives of all customers and partners on these topics.\u201d\n\nBeyond the potential boost to Trump\u2019s re-election hopes, Starbucks employees who reached out to HuffPost expressed other concerns about a Schultz presidency.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re a businessman does not mean you\u2019re also a stellar leader,\u201d said a fourth current Starbucks employee. \u201cWe learned that from our current president.\u201d\n\nJess Svabenik, a Starbucks barista in Washington state, also wouldn\u2019t want to see Schultz elected president, noting that Schultz once opposed legislation to increase the minimum wage in Seattle to $15 per hour.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/howard-schultz-democrats-2020_us_5c522fa1e4b093663f5afc7f": "WASHINGTON \u2015 An independent presidential bid by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wouldn\u2019t only threaten Democrats by siphoning anti-Trump votes, it could also hurt the party\u2019s messaging on critical issues like health care, taxes and spending.\n\nSchultz, a self-identified \u201clifelong Democrat,\u201d earned a reputation as one of the most progressive corporate leaders with his unwavering support of gay marriage, racial equality and labor-friendly policies during his tenure at the coffee company.\n\nIf he decides to go forward with what he calls a \u201ccentrist independent\u201d bid for president in 2020, Schultz would aid Republicans in their efforts to portray Democrats as extreme and radical by proposing things like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal.\n\nWith a third-party candidate on the ballot who echoes their rhetoric, the GOP would have more room to argue that their ideas are sensible and middle-of-the-road.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Schultz is even considering a candidacy speaks to how far left the Democratic Party has gone,\u201d said Matt Gorman, the former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThe longer he is in the race, the more he highlights that fact. It will cause some uncomfortable questions for Democrats to have to answer on taxes, entitlements and spending.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire former executive called Warren\u2019s proposed tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million \u201cridiculous.\u201d He blasted Harris\u2019 endorsement of a single, government-run insurance program modeled on Medicare as \u201cun-American.\u201d He used similar language to describe Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea of a 70 percent top marginal tax rate on income over $10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so un-American to think that way,\u201d Schultz said at his book tour event in New York City on Monday when asked about an adviser to Ocasio-Cortez describing the existence of billionaires in the country as a \u201cpolicy failure.\u201d\n\nThe rhetorical onslaught of a would-be candidate who hasn\u2019t even officially entered the race has left many Democrats howling, accusing Schultz of embarking on an arrogant campaign with little chance of success other than potentially handing President Donald Trump a second term in office.\n\n\u201cThe reason his [campaign] rollout is going so bad is not just because they\u2019ve failed to execute well, but that the idea has no constituency outside of his personal friends,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats are also irked that Schultz has stomped on their string of victories in Congress in recent months by dominating media coverage this week in multiple appearances on national television, despite November\u2019s 40-seat pickup in the House and Trump\u2019s cave-in on the government shutdown.\n\nBut Republicans are clearly enjoying the show. They\u2019re happy to point to Schultz\u2019s criticisms as yet more evidence that Democrats are wrong about the direction they want to take the country in as the 2020 presidential campaign ramps up.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see no shortage of Democratic freakouts over the next two years. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)\n\n\u201cAny help we get in terms of sending the message that a single government-run health care plan that just raises people\u2019s taxes and takes away the ability to provide Medicare for individuals over the age of 65... I think sending that message is a good one,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo if Mr. Schultz or other members... that are closer to the middle are prepared to say that, that\u2019s probably healthy for the debate.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said he was skeptical about the viability of a Schultz candidacy and whom it may help in the 2020 election. But he, too, said he liked what he heard from the former executive about health care and government spending.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s being realistic. No one really seriously believes we can find $3 trillion a year to pay for everyone\u2019s health care in America,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a former GOP presidential contender with an affinity for political combat, appeared to be relishing the controversy when asked about Democratic criticism of Schultz.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/millennials-going-to-congress_us_5c45f369e4b0bfa693c600e6": "On Jan. 3, 31-year-old Katie Hill posted a tweet about her first day at a new job. \u201cSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom,\u201d she wrote, the text paired with a cute photo of her hugging an older woman bearing a striking resemblance to her.\n\nIt felt like a typically millennial type of milestone post. Except that Hill\u2019s new job was congresswoman for California\u2019s 25th District, and when she was hugging her mom, she was surrounded by TV cameras arranged to document her swearing-in ceremony.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re about to be sworn in. Let\u2019s do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 \u2014 Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nHill is my age. In fact, we were born just three weeks apart, both late summer babies. We grew up thousands of miles apart, but in many ways, I see myself in her. We both make jokes about our respective \u201cresting bitch faces\u201d and take photos in snowstorms. I know this because she posts those photos on Instagram.\n\nHill is, unquestionably, my peer. So is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (29, D-N.Y.), Max Rose (31, D-N.Y.), Haley Stevens (35, D-Mich.), Lauren Underwood (32, D-Ill.), Abby Finkenauer (30, D-Iowa), Ilhan Omar (37, D-Minn.) ... and 14 other freshman members of Congress, comprising one of the most diverse classes in United States history.\n\nAt the start of the 115th Congress in January 2017, there were just five millennials (individuals born between 1981 and 1996) in the House of Representatives. But as of January 2018, when the 116th Congress convened, there are 26. According to Pew, more than one-fifth of the 91 congressional freshmen are millennials, and two-thirds (14) of those representatives are Democrats.\n\nFor the first time, the millennial generation \u2015 my generation \u2015 is represented in Congress in numbers that really matter. And for the first time, the millennial generation can see those numbers in action. We can watch Stevens enter her office for the first time. We can witness Omar beam with pride as she gets sworn in with her hand on the Quran. We can follow along as Ocasio-Cortez and Hill and Underwood try to track down Mitch McConnell to confront him about the government shutdown. (#WheresMitch.)\n\nBecause here to combat Donald Trump\u2019s clapback presidency, defined by one-sided exultations and blocked accounts on Twitter, is a cohort of freshmen congresspeople who are naturally inclined to view social media as a public forum.\n\n800,000 workers are missing their paychecks and we\u2019re pushing to get them paid ASAP.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re here doing our job - the House has voted to reopen government whole or in part several times - so why can\u2019t we find GOP Senators to ask them do theirs? #WheresMitch pic.twitter.com/FogCPg6ayZ \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 16, 2019\n\nPredictably, there has been a swift backlash to these (diverse, mostly female) newly minted, digital native politicians. The negative reaction has been especially vicious toward Ocasio-Cortez, who, as a progressive young woman of color, would have stood out in Congress even without her dynamic social media presence, but seems to be perceived as a threat to both the establishment of her own party and sexist obsessives outside of it.\n\n\u201cShe needs to decide: Does she want to be an effective legislator or just continue being a Twitter star?\u201d one House Democrat told Politico last week, suggesting that those two things must be mutually exclusive, as though a fiery Twitter presence must be indicative of a purely self-serving desire for fame rather than a genuine desire to communicate with the public.\n\nThis is a perception that Stevens takes issue with. \u201cI think we should be celebrating the way that this freshman class is using social media to bring a new level of transparency and access to our government,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a great thing!\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThe arrival of these social media-savvy millennial congresspeople is thrilling to watch on another level; an indication that people my age are growing up to become the power brokers and thought leaders that a wider culture told us we were too lazy and entitled to be.\n\n\u201cI have always been fascinated by politics, but up until this election, it felt like something the \u2018grown-ups\u2019 handled,\u201d Kate Ormonde, 34, told me, explaining how the photographs that came out of swearing-in day affected her. \u201c[There were] so many women of different backgrounds, dressed in bright colors, contrasted with white men in dark suits.\u201d\n\nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Stevens join their fellow House Democratic women for a portrait in front of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAt 22 percent of the population, millennials are poised to become the largest living generation, currently ranging in age from 23 to 38, a prime time to be entering into the ranks of power inside and outside government.\n\nWe\u2019re also an endlessly \u2015 and arguably, unfairly \u2015 mocked generation. We\u2019ve allegedly \u201ckilled\u201d everything, from Applebee\u2019s to beer to home ownership to diamonds. We\u2019re too sensitive, too self-absorbed and too focused on buying avocado toast to save up for a home or focus on building stable careers. Look a bit closer, and we\u2019re the first generation that is predicted to be financially worse off than our parents. We\u2019re saddled with student debt. We\u2019re perennially burned out even as we try harder and harder to optimize our lives. It\u2019s becoming infinitely harder to prepare for retirement.\n\nMany of the millennials I spoke to for this piece mentioned these lived experiences as a reason they were so thrilled to see a critical mass of their peers so visibly in government.\n\n\u201cThey understand that younger people have to work harder than their parents to achieve the same quality of life,\u201d said Aaron Huertas, 34. \u201cThey grew up with the climate crisis as textbook science. They\u2019ve adopted more democratic forms of communication and seem friendlier to grassroots politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see people have our ideals in mind, advocating for issues that impact us,\u201d added Eva Rubinoff, 31, citing student loans and social security as things she\u2019d hope to see prioritized.\n\nI have always been fascinated by politics, but up until this election, it felt like something the \u2018grown-ups\u2019 handled. Kate Ormonde, 34\n\nOf course, these freshman congresspeople are still determining which issues to tweet about, what photos and videos to share and what stories to promote. No social media account is going to be truly unfiltered, and as a public forum, social media certainly has its clear faults. But by breaking down some of the traditional barriers that have long existed between elected leaders and their constituents, these representatives are projecting a different sense of accessibility \u2015 one that works in these newly elected officials\u2019 favor.\n\nNot only are younger voters relating to them, but constituents are more able to view social media as a place of discussion rather than one-sided doomsday announcements and opaque decision-making. The expectations that the public has for its elected officials \u2015 both online and off \u2015 is shifting.\n\nStevens told HuffPost that she often uses Facebook and Twitter to direct-message with constituents, including those who vehemently disagree with her. Sometimes, she says, she even takes those conversations offline by asking for her constituent\u2019s phone number so they can talk about the issue in a more personal way. She sees her Instagram as more of an open window; by posting informal photos and videos of her day, she hopes people can get a daily glimpse of what she\u2019s up to behind the closed doors of Capitol Hill.\n\nThis is a sentiment that Hill echoed to CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t want to become more formal. That\u2019s not on the table,\u201d she said.\n\nPerhaps no congressional newbie better encapsulates the shift in public discourse than Ocasio-Cortez. She has posted Instagram stories of her office, her voting card, her press-on manicure, postcards from her constituents and her dance moves. Last week, she posted a photo of herself on the couch, under a fuzzy blanket with a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream. \u201cSpoiler alert: Congress is like any other job where you have your long and tiring days and just want to eat ice cream at the end of it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nInstagram Ocasio-Cortez shares a glimpse into her post-work life on Instagram Story.\n\nWhat a gift to see the job of a congressperson as just that \u2015 a job, not something that is separate from most of us, not entailing decisions made in an ivory tower by wealthy white elders. It\u2019s too early to tell what the legacy of these young politicians might be, but damn if it doesn\u2019t feel good to watch your peers take charge of the messy country we\u2019ve collectively inherited.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-year-old-gifted-college-student_us_5c3cc04be4b0e0baf53fcef0": "I was a 3-year-old preschooler when I corrected my teacher\u2019s knowledge of the constitutional requirements to be U.S. president. In kindergarten, I learned that telling my friends that Bashar al-Assad was using chemical weapons against his own people would cause kids to cry on the playground. My parents received a call from an unhappy principal that day. And telling my third-grade science teacher that her knowledge of gravity lacked depth earned me a spot on her naughty list for the rest of the year.\n\nAdults are constantly telling me how to think and what to say. But mostly what not to say! After my doctors tested my IQ to be above the 99.9th percentile in third grade and said my EQ (emotional intelligence) was also surprisingly high, everything changed and adults started taking me more seriously \u2015 I finally felt that I was being heard. The tests showed that I was something called \u201cprofoundly gifted.\u201d I was admitted into Mensa International, a program for individuals with a high IQ, and became a Davidson Institute Young Scholar. My parents started getting professional advice in order to learn more about the needs of profoundly-gifted kids, and they moved me to a specialized elementary school. Today we live in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Pleasanton, and I attend both fourth grade and college. I am having an awesome time.\n\nPeople always ask if I am a \u201cgenius,\u201d but my parents explain that genius is an action \u2015 it requires solving big problems that have a human impact. Right now I am a 9-year-old boy with very strong skills in some areas. Mom says she\u2019s the only genius in the house because it takes one to keep this house from falling apart! I roll my eyes! Mom also claims that IQ comes from the \u201cX\u201d chromosome. Dad rolls his eyes! My family is very funny.\n\nYou probably have an image of 'gifted' kids as weird bookworms with no social skills. But I think of myself as any other normal, happy kid.\n\nYou probably have an image of \u201cgifted\u201d kids as weird bookworms with no social skills. But I think of myself as any other normal, happy kid. I collect Pok\u00e9mon cards and know all the dance moves in Fortnite. I have a lot of friends, and we make naughty jokes and play basketball and games. I don\u2019t always get A\u2019s on tests; my family does not believe that grades are that important. I sneak in video games when my parents aren\u2019t looking. And I get grounded for breaking rules. Actually, I am grounded right now from using the iPad. My parents lecture me all the time that I am failing something called a marshmallow test. But I think my parents are failing the patience test. Let\u2019s just say I am glad to be too old for timeouts.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there are some things that I am weirdly good at. The doctors call it \u201casynchronous learning.\u201d That means I can learn academic subjects at an accelerated speed and even out of sequence. For example, I learned linear algebra concepts before I ever took a formal algebra class. My parents like to say that I literally \u201cKhan Academy\u2019ed\u201d my way into college. But there are other areas where my brain is still catching up, like handwriting, spelling and taking notes. I am using spellcheck a lot for this essay! Also, I am just OK on piano, and I don\u2019t learn foreign languages easily. I am trying to challenge myself by learning Bengali from my family and Mandarin from my very patient tutor Ms. Vienna. Please wish me luck!\n\nBut I do have a knack for computer languages. I started Python programming at YoungWonks coding academy at just 7 years old. Today I am among the academy\u2019s most advanced Python students, and I used my Python background to teach myself more than a dozen coding languages and interfaces. I am also taking an open-source masterclass on machine learning.\n\nI am also obsessed with books. A good book makes me forget to finish my meals and get ready on time for school. This causes my parents to yell a lot. Wait, isn\u2019t reading supposed to be a good thing? A few of my favorite books from 2018 were: Neil deGrasse Tyson\u2019s Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and the Game of Thrones series. I tried reading Carl Sagan\u2019s Cosmos, but the writing was dry and boring. But I also like reading books that many of my friends are reading, such as Captain Underpants, the Harry Potter series (I read all eight books in the eight weeks of summer break after first grade), The Percy Jackson series and Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\n\nI learned linear algebra concepts before I ever took a formal algebra class. But there are other areas where my brain is still catching up, like handwriting, spelling and taking notes. I am using spellcheck a lot for this essay!\n\nMore than anything else, I am famous in our social circle for being a political junkie. I have watched every presidential debate since I was 3 years old, starting with Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. My favorite news sources are HuffPost, NPR and MSNBC. I am obsessed with Rachel Maddow. Maybe because she grew up in the same Bay Area city where I was born. I even had a chance to ask my congressman, Eric Swalwell, at a recent community meeting about the Democrats\u2019 Supreme Court strategy. But I think he was more focused on my age instead of my question. By the way, he is 1 of 1,000 Democrats thinking about running for president!\n\nIn the daytime, I attend fourth grade at a specialized gifted school called Helios in Sunnyvale. Even though I am new to the school this year, I finally feel that I have teachers and friends who understand me and don\u2019t try to change me. We sit on rocking chairs to help with our fidgetiness, and we can even go for a quick run or do jumping jacks during class if that helps us think better. They encourage us to be autonomous and accountable learners while working in groups. We don\u2019t get homework, and the subjects are taught to fit the way our brains work. We learn mostly by researching and completing complex projects, and the subjects are integrated so that we understand real-life connections between math, science, economics and humanities. The best part is that I have not been sent to the principal\u2019s office even once this semester! I even got elected to the Student Council, and my friends are so proud of me and brag to everyone that I attend college.\n\nAfter day school, I attend Las Positas College, where I am working on my associate degrees in chemistry and math. Did you know that Sir Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking were Lucasian Professors of mathematics at Cambridge University? I had to go through interviews and assessments to prove to the administration that I had both the scholastic aptitude and the executive functions to attend college. Now the administration and professors treat me like any other student. I follow the same rules, and the classes cannot be modified for me.\n\nBeing an extrovert has helped me make a lot of friends in college \u2015 they even ask me to tutor them. Whenever I start a new class, other students give me curious looks, and I can see some people secretly taking photos and videos of me. I hear them whispering, \u201cHe\u2019s so cute!\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s so smart!\u201d but I try to break the ice by introducing myself so they can see that it\u2019s OK to talk to me and be my friend. I also send my professors an email before the first day of class so that they are not confused when I walk in.\n\nBefore I started college, my parents used to let me try anything I wanted as long as I showed interest and commitment. But now my parents worry that I might get overwhelmed, and they encourage me to slow down. For my first college course, they forced me to enroll in baby math (aka algebra I) because they wanted me to develop soft skills and get used to being in a college setting. It was so boring that I spent a lot of time playing video games during class. Then I convinced my parents to let me take an assessment test so that I could take harder classes. My college assessment test showed that I was ready for calculus \u2013 that\u2019s four levels above baby math! I think my parents are starting to believe that I actually do know what I\u2019m doing.\n\nBeing an extrovert has helped me make a lot of friends in college \u2013 they even ask me to tutor them.\n\nSo far, the content of the college classes has not really been a challenge since I process information easily. I don\u2019t study much at all. I feel that my professors and classmates respect my abilities. But I have other types of challenges as a college student. Because of the asynchronous development, I do not have good time-management skills or strong note-taking skills, and sometimes I have trouble reading my own handwriting! My parents help me by typing out study notes from my textbooks, even though they might not understand the content.\n\nAlso, I do whine a lot over homework because it is boring and long. I think this worries my parents because they keep reminding me that work ethic and ethos are more important than IQ. They were concerned when I spent only one hour to study all 14 chapters for my chemistry final, but then I got a 101 percent. Remember their obsession with the marshmallow test? I hope to transfer to MIT in two to three years. Hopefully, MIT will disagree with my parents\u2019 definition of work ethic.\n\nMy biggest challenge during class (and during this essay) is to train my brain to stay focused and keep from wandering off to random thoughts. At any time, I could be thinking about anything from the Yemen famine to how do get out of piano practice that day.\n\nMy parents always had an open and transparent philosophy with me. That means our family does not have any questions that are off-limits, though I do sometimes get low-quality answers on controversial subjects. I think they regret their open philosophy after being forced to explain to me some words and concepts from the Game of Thrones books. I have a provocative personality. So my parents \u201cremind me\u201d (more like, threaten me) that I have to respect the boundaries other parents might have and I should not share controversial knowledge with my friends.\n\nI am excited that I will be interning next summer in the artificial intelligence division of one of the largest technology companies in the world. I used my charm offensive in the interview! My boss is a famous female scientist who worked with Stephen Hawking. For my fourth-grade spring research paper, my Helios teachers will allow me to choose a topic that is related to my internship. I have a big support system of parents, relatives, family friends, mentors, teachers and doctors who are happy to help me.

Meanwhile, officials were spotted seizing materials from Stone\u2019s apartment in Manhattan.\n\nA federal grand jury convened by Mueller indicted Stone on seven counts relating to communications with WikiLeaks, the Russia-connected outfit that released material stolen in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee servers.\n\nStone, an eccentric veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, was instrumental in President Donald Trump\u2019s early campaign effort. He continued to serve as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign after departing in August 2015, and is known to have the ear of the president.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone spoke with unnamed \u201csenior Trump campaign officials\u201d about materials WikiLeaks had that could be damaging to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The 24-page indictment accuses Stone of obstructing investigations by congressional intelligence committees and the FBI, making false statements and tampering with a witness.\n\nHere are some of the indictment\u2019s wildest parts:\n\nStone evoked \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d as he pressured someone else with knowledge of the WikiLeaks hack to lie to Congress.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone worked hard to prevent an unnamed individual \u2015 referred to as Person 2 in the indictment but identified through context as radio host Randy Credico \u2015 from contradicting testimony that Stone gave before the House intelligence committee in September 2017. Stone lied to the committee about discussions he had about WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC hack, the indictment says, and the committee wished to speak to Credico two months later.\n\nThe two men apparently discussed a scene from \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d in which the mobster Frank Pentangeli pretends to be ignorant of certain information.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn multiple occasions, including on or about December 1, 2017, STONE told Person 2 that Person 2 should do a \u201cFrank Pentangeli\u201d before HPSCI in order to avoid contradicting STONE\u2019s testimony. Frank Pentangeli is a character in the film The Godfather: Part II, which both STONE and Person 2 had discussed, who testifies before a congressional committee and in that testimony claims not to know critical information that he does in fact know.\n\n... He also suggested emulating Richard Nixon.\n\nWhen Credico texted Stone about the House intelligence committee\u2019s request for voluntary testimony in November, Stone, who worked for Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, quoted his former boss.\n\nHe wrote: \u201d\u2018Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan\u2019 ... Richard Nixon.\u201d When Credico told Stone that he was facing a subpoena, Stone pressed him to assert his 5th Amendment rights \u2015 and he did.\n\nIn related news, many photos of Stone\u2019s Nixon back tattoo emerged Friday on Twitter.\n\nCan\u2019t decide which is more disturbing, the tattoo, the fact that Nixon picture is so much bigger than Reagan, or that this now indicted guy is a close confidant and adviser to the current President of the greatest nation on earth. pic.twitter.com/myElSrq3vI \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 25, 2019\n\nAnd Stone threatened a dog.\n\nThe relationship between Stone and Credico subsequently took a downward turn, with Stone threatening the radio host\u2019s dog, Bianca.\n\n\u201cPrepare to die,\u201d Stone wrote.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn or about April 9, 2018, STONE wrote in an email to Person 2, \u201cYou are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds.\u201d STONE also said he would \u201ctake that dog away from you,\u201d referring to Person 2\u2019s dog. On or about the same day, STONE wrote to Person 2, \u201cI am so ready. Let\u2019s get it on. Prepare to die [expletive].\u201d\n\nA Trump campaign official \u201cwas directed\u201d to get in touch with Stone about the hack.\n\nThe indictment does not name specific Trump campaign officials or suggest what Trump himself may have known about Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks. But if an already \u201csenior\u201d official \u201cwas directed\u201d to contact Stone, few would presumably have the authority to do such directing.\n\nThe Trump campaign was very interested in what WikiLeaks may have mined from DNC servers.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nAfter the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.\n\nSomeone with knowledge of the DNC hack suggested putting out the message that Clinton was \u201cold, memory bad, has stroke.\u201d\n\nIn early August 2016, another person who knew about the WikiLeaks hack, referred to as Person 1, emailed Stone to say that the group planned two more information dumps. Right-wing author and birther conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Friday that the indictment referred to him.\n\n\u201cImpact planned to be very damaging,\u201d Corsi wrote, suggesting the Trump campaign push the idea that Clinton was in bad health. Trump himself peddled doubts about his opponent\u2019s health on the campaign trail, fueling a right-wing conspiracy theory.\n\nRyan Goodman, former special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense, said on Twitter that the idea could have \u201csignificant\u201d legal implications if it could be used to show coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nPerson 1 added in the same email, \u201cTime to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w 5 enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC. That appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke \u2013 neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for [Clinton] Foundation debacle.\u201d\n\nThe day Stone swore he had not texted or emailed with \u201cPerson 2,\u201d the two men exchanged 30 texts.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the very day Stone testified before the House intelligence committee that he never sent or received written communications with Credico, the pair \u201cexchanged over thirty text messages.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include Randy Credico\u2019s name as Person 2.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-polling_us_5c40c939e4b027c3bbbf3672": "It wasn\u2019t clear whether Nancy Pelosi would be speaker when Democrats won control of the House in last November\u2019s elections.\n\nConsidered too much of a lightning rod for Republicans, a couple dozen of the chamber\u2019s Democrats sought to force her to give up the spot at the top of their caucus.

Breaking down the numbers, she surged 14 points among Democrats, 8 points among independents and even gone up 1 point with Republicans.\n\nIn Gallup polls, Pelosi is more popular than she has been in a decade.

Speaker Pelosi is, and has always been, a boss,\u201d said Shaunna Thomas with UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pelosi wrote to Trump that, with no end in sight to the shutdown, it would be best if he not deliver his State of the Union address to a joint congressional session on Jan. 29, suggesting that he provide the traditional speech in writing instead. She said it was wrong to hold the event since the Secret Service is among the agencies hit by the shutdown and its agents are working without funding.\n\nPelosi, in other words, was taking away one of Trump\u2019s favorite things: a big TV audience.\n\nIn response on Thursday, Trump said he was canceling a planned official foreign trip was spearheading that included a stop in Afghanistan, which required travel with military personnel. He informed her just an hour before she and other members of Congress were set to leave.\n\nIn comments to HuffPost, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who had been one of the most vocal Democrats urging Pelosi to yield the speakership to someone else, couldn\u2019t bring himself to praise her for the job. But he also didn\u2019t criticize her.\n\n\u201cI think we need to get a deal (ending the shutdown). We\u2019ve got to get these people back to work. It\u2019s difficult because the president\u2019s word isn\u2019t very reliable,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m just shaking my head at the whole thing.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/karen-pence-anti-lgbtq-school_us_5c44618ce4b0bfa693c46f51": "The news that Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, is teaching at D.C.-area school that openly bans LGBT+ faculty and students \u2015 and any manner of pro-LGBT+ belief or affiliation \u2015 seemed to generate a lot of surprise among my peers. Not a surprise that the nation\u2019s second lady would work there, but that such a school would exist \u2014 right in liberal Northern Virginia!\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised. I\u2019d grown up attending such a school. I figured they were a dime-a-dozen.\n\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t keen on reading any of the news stories, but something caught my eye. Immanuel Christian School, in Springfield? I didn\u2019t go to a school like that; I went to that school. From 1989\u20131997. I\u2019m also gay.\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre reading about little ICS in the national media. A common description affixed to it, in this latest culture war dust-up, is \u201can anti-LGBT school.\u201d It\u2019s an odd label, as if being anti-gay were its raison d\u2019etre. But it is, I must say, more than fair.\n\nI\u2019ve been following the reporting, the commentary, the vice president\u2019s public diatribe in response to the backlash against his wife and the school and, given my own experience, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sympathetic to his claims of persecution. Let\u2019s be clear, nobody is arguing that private, religious schools can\u2019t exist or can\u2019t legally discriminate. It\u2019s a clear First Amendment right. And what I was hearing was merely criticism, or in most cases matter-of-fact reporting, of the school\u2019s policies.\n\nThat harsh light of visibility, the audacity to call hate, hate, seems to anger Mike Pence. And his angry response has only further offended those who were appalled by his wife\u2019s choice to teach there in the first place. And \u2019round and \u2019round it goes.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing, I think, when people talk about a discrimination policy like this, is the practical experience of what that actually looks like. It certainly sounds unfair. But it\u2019s so much more than that.\n\nNo student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. That would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ICS.\n\nGrowing up, we had no clue our school had the policy statements or hiring forms it does. No student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. That would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ICS. No openly gay or lesbian teacher was ever turned away, because it would have been clear from a mile away this wasn\u2019t the place for them. The policies were there, I\u2019m sure, in a file cabinet somewhere. They stated what would, to anyone attending the institution, go without saying. And they enforced something much more consequential, namely the curriculum.\n\nIt does have to be said that ICS was a good school. It was small, intimate, and \u2014 aside from a middle school biology course that seemed to focus 90 percent on debunking evolution, without actually teaching any of its underlying principles \u2014 the academic education I received there was stellar.\n\nIt was also a hotbed of right-wing fanaticism, shoved down the throats of impressionable children at every turn. The community of teachers, students and families was fiercely like-minded and almost exclusively Republican. In 1992, they held a school-wide vote for the presidential election. George H.W. Bush, seeking a second term that Bill Clinton would deny him, won by a staggering landslide.\n\nThe effect of this environment went beyond the official coursework. Teachers, especially in the later grades, where students started to converse about the topics of the day, would constantly editorialize and share their opinions about the world. They were encouraged to do so, I\u2019m sure, and they presented their views as Gospel fact.\n\nI learned at a very young age how our country was \u201clost\u201d and had the blood of innocent babies on its hands. Gay marriage was an affront to the natural order. Nobody even brought that one up \u2014 our teacher came in one day, in 1996, fuming that a court in Hawaii had suggested otherwise.\n\nHuffPost A school photo of Cronkhite when he was in 6th grade in 1994.\n\nIt was also, apparently, vital to the spiritual survival of our country to always, unwaveringly support the state of Israel. Which, to us students, was a country far, far away where Jesus was from.\n\nBasically, if James Dobson or Rush Limbaugh was saying it, we were hearing it. While many of the messages were probably typically the kind you\u2019d hear in any Christian school, I think they had a particular intensity there. We weren\u2019t in Oklahoma; we were inside the Beltway, in the lion\u2019s den, and the world around us was an evil, corrupt, and frightening place. One day, when we graduated, we would have to go out into this world. We would have to be prepared.\n\n\n\nKaren Pence is going to fit right in.\n\n\n\nEventually, in middle school, discussions would touch on sexuality. Obviously, homosexuality was evil. They didn\u2019t talk about this a whole lot; it was best not to dwell on it, but the unfortunate topic had to be broached. What was shocking, even to me then, was the vitriol. These were Christians and generally very kind people. Evangelicals have a way of talking about sexual minorities in public. They use the word \u201clove\u201d a lot and talk softly of hating the sin. When they\u2019re among themselves, they tend to be more candid. Needless to say, it was made very clear to me, and to all of us, that there was nothing worse than being gay. They were disgusting perverts who hated Christians and had a nefarious agenda to dismantle society.\n\n\n\nAs a boy on the cusp of puberty, only just beginning to realize I was different, this wasn\u2019t a nurturing message, especially coming from a trusted teacher and echoed enthusiastically by everyone I had ever called a friend. I remember wanting to turn invisible, imagining they could tell that maybe, just maybe, I was one of those perverts.\n\nThey\u2019re not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. They\u2019re trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. That\u2019s not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn\u2019t great for me.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t tell though, and I wouldn\u2019t have dared say it. I could barely admit it to myself back then. But time marches on, and I\u2019m now happily married to my husband (despite what my 6th grade teacher would say about that). I made it out. Still, I carried that sense of fear and isolation well into public high school. I grew depressed there. I never attempted suicide, but I certainly thought about it a lot. I wonder sometimes about the other LGBT+ students who went through Immanuel Christian School, before and after me. Were they as resilient? Have any killed themselves?\n\nWhat I do know is any school can be a rough place for a gay kid. There are always bullies. It doesn\u2019t help when the teachers are in on it. Once, in my public high school, when some boys made a cruel, homophobic joke, the teacher cut them off. He then berated them to the point I thought they would cry. I had never seen an adult stand up for people like me before. I didn\u2019t even know that was possible. ICS made sure of that.\n\nThat\u2019s what their discrimination policy is all about. They\u2019re not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. They\u2019re trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. That\u2019s not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn\u2019t great for me.\n\nWhile part of me would love to see the supposed liberal-fascist machine shut down schools like ICS, that won\u2019t ever happen. Religious schools are part of this country. So, instead, I would like to see them change from within. And that won\u2019t happen if we refuse to even talk about them. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re talking about this school, and I\u2019m glad people are being critical. Now maybe the Pences are the ones who will have to learn some resilience.\n\nIan Cronkhite grew up in Northern Virginia.

That report was then cited in multiple major news outlets, including a July 2018 HuffPost article that argued King is a white supremacist \u2014 an article King read.\n\nHuffPost first asked King if he\u2019s a white nationalist in December 2017, after he tweeted \u201cdiversity is not our strength.\u201d We asked again, in June 2018, after he promoted a neo-Nazi on Twitter. We asked in August, after he promoted another white supremacist on Twitter. We asked again in September, after we unearthed an interview he gave to an Austrian website affiliated with Europe\u2019s neo-fascist \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement.\n\nHe never denied being a white nationalist to us. In October, he told an Iowa TV host that he didn\u2019t think the term \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d was derogatory. He won re-election anyway in November, but by the slimmest margin of his long congressional career.\n\nIt was only earlier this month \u2014 after he told The New York Times he didn\u2019t understand why terms like \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d were offensive \u2014 that House GOP leadership decided to punish him, stripping him of his committee assignments.\n\nAn effort by two rank-and-file House Democrats to censure him, a rare and formal reprimand, was quashed by Democratic leadership over fears that it would set a precedent for punishing speech made outside the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s not what I want,\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), told reporters after his resolution to censure King was rejected. \u201cThe next time something like this happens, we\u2019ll bring it out of committee, and I think we move to expel him at that point.\u201d\n\nMajor GOP figures including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Rep. Liz Cheney, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, along with a slew of rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats, called on King to resign.\n\nKing has said, however, that he will not resign, and has made the dubious claim that The New York Times took his comments about white supremacy out of context.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-bolton-notebook-troops-venezuela_us_5c4f8fcce4b0d9f9be6850e2": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Trump administration officials maintained Monday that \u201call options\u201d \u2015 including the use of military force \u2015 are on the table concerning its attempts to remove Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.

Large protests in Venezuela have bolstered the push to remove Maduro, whose time in office has included authoritarian crackdowns on political foes and an economic crisis driven in part by a collapse in global oil prices.\n\nThe U.S. announcement of new sanctions followed Maduro\u2019s refusal to cede his post to Guaido in the face of pressure from the White House. The Trump administration hopes the additional economic penalties targeting Maduro\u2019s government and the state-owned oil company will bolster their efforts to break the will of the armed forces, whose continued support for Maduro is crucial to his bid to retain power.\n\nUse of U.S. military force in Venezuela could spark an outbreak of violence in a country already plagued by ongoing humanitarian crises, experts have warned.\n\n\u201cI have to think that there\u2019s not much real appetite for a military intervention in Venezuela in the Trump administration,\u201d Geoff Ramsey, an expert on the country at the Washington Office for Latin America, a think tank, said Monday.\n\nHe told HuffPost before the administration briefing that he believed U.S. officials are \u201creally interested in talking the talk and not necessarily walking the walk. And I think the Maduro regime knows that, and they know that a kind of confrontational rhetoric really ultimately weakens the hand of the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to think that the foreign policy establishment actually understands that intervening militarily in Venezuela would be a disaster,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cA military option, even threats of a military option, are entirely counterproductive and need to be kept off the table at all costs.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has a long history of using its military and intelligence services to try to oust Latin American leaders it opposes. The U.S. was closely linked to a failed coup against socialist President Hugo Chavez in 2002.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) reintroduced legislation on Monday to help law enforcement respond to a horrifying and largely invisible crisis: Hundreds of Native American women are simply disappearing or being murdered.\n\nThere is next to no data available on what, exactly, is going on. At least 506 indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been killed in 71 U.S. cities, including more than 330 since 2010, according to a November report by Urban Indian Health Institute. Most cases have been in the last decade, though the oldest case dated to 1943. But that 506 is likely a gross undercount, per the institute, because of the limited or complete lack of data being collected by law enforcement agencies. A staggering 95 percent of these cases were never covered by the national media, and the circumstances surrounding many of these deaths and disappearances remain unknown.\n\nThe overall level of violence faced by Native women is equally appalling. A whopping 84 percent of Native women experience violence in their lifetime, and in some tribal communities, Native women are murdered at 10 times the national average.\n\nMurkowski\u2019s bill, called Savanna\u2019s Act, is as much an attempt to put attention on the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women as it is to understand the severity of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know what we don\u2019t know with this,\u201d the Alaska senator said in an interview. \u201cIt is a challenge, at best, to try to understand the extent of the problem. And if you can\u2019t understand the extent of the problem, it\u2019s really hard to know how to properly resource it.\u201d\n\nHer bill would boost coordination and data collection among tribal, local, state and federal law enforcement in cases involving missing and murdered Native women. It requires the departments of Justice, Interior, and Health and Human Services to seek recommendations from tribes on enhancing the safety of Native women. It requires new guidelines for responding to these cases, in consultation with tribes. It requires that statistics on missing and murdered Native women be included in an annual report to Congress.\n\nThe bill is named for Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-old indigenous woman who was abducted and killed in North Dakota in 2017. She was pregnant, and her baby was cut from her womb.\n\nTed S. Warren/ASSOCIATED PRESS Native American tribal members sing and drum in the rotunda of the Capitol in Olympia, Washington, in January 2018. Their gathering was part of Native American Indian Lobby Day.\n\nSavanna\u2019s Act was this close to becoming law at the end of the last Congress. It unanimously passed the Senate and was ready for a quick vote in the House. But former Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), then the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, single-handedly prevented the bill from getting a House vote. Former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who was the original author of the bill but lost re-election in November, spent her final weeks in the Senate publicly shaming Goodlatte for sinking the legislation.\n\nHeitkamp said at the time that the situation is so dire in her state that almost everyone in Indian Country \u2015 roughly 30,000 American Indians live in North Dakota \u2015 personally knows someone who has gone missing or been murdered.\n\nShe and Goodlatte are gone now. But Murkowski said before Heitkamp left, she promised her she would carry her bill forward. She called Goodlatte\u2019s obstruction \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he was doing,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cBut that member is gone. And I\u2019m still here. And we\u2019re going to move it early and with some force and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nIt is a challenge, at best, to try to understand the extent of the problem. Sen. Lisa Murkowski\n\nMurkowski\u2019s bill is identical to Heitkamp\u2019s, which means it includes a provision that Goodlatte wanted to strip out. It requires the Justice Department to give preference to states, localities or tribes that apply for law enforcement grants to focus on missing and murdered Native women. Goodlatte wanted that language out because he said it would disadvantage grant applications from law enforcement agencies that don\u2019t have significant Native American populations in their jurisdictions.\n\nMurkowski said she plans to try to get her bill before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee soon. It already has a lot of bipartisan co-sponsors, including Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).\n\nThe bill also doesn\u2019t cost any additional federal money. How much easier could this be to pass?\n\nMurkowski could only speculate on why so many indigenous women are going missing or being murdered. She said she was at an Anchorage rally a couple of years ago called The Barefoot Mile, which was a walk around the city to support victims of human trafficking. She learned there that one of the \u201cbrutal realities\u201d is that Native women command more money from traffickers.\n\n\u201cNative women, because of their looks, can be viewed as more exotic, more Asian, and apparently there is a higher market for women that are of Asian descent,\u201d said the senator. \u201cWhen I heard that, it just\u2026 It just sickens me.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the bill text for Savanna\u2019s Act if you want to read it yourself:", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lausd-charter-schools-los-angeles-teachers-strike_us_5c3f503ae4b0e0baf54374ef": "LOS ANGELES \u2015 Tuesday, on the second day of the Los Angeles teachers strike, tens of thousands of educators protested in front of the California Charter Schools Association building at a rally so crowded that participants were standing shoulder to shoulder.\n\nAmong the crowd of protesters were teachers from Accelerated Charter Schools, who started their own strike Tuesday morning, along with members of the United Teachers Los Angeles union.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Unified School District strike heads into its third day \u2015 affecting half a million students and over 30,000 teachers \u2015 with no immediate end in sight, charter schools are in the spotlight. Teachers are asking the district for smaller class sizes and more support staff, and in the backdrop are larger issues about charter school growth and how it affects district finances.\n\nAnd educators from the Accelerated Charter Schools \u2015 a network of three schools \u2015 are standing in solidarity while fighting for their own needs.\n\nA strike of charter school educators is unprecedented in California and nearly unprecedented in the nation \u2015 the vast majority of charter school educators are not unionized, unlike those from Accelerated Charter Schools. On Tuesday these educators joined the thousands of traditional public school teachers on strike, notably rallying outside the building of an organization that works to advance charter schools\u2019 interests.\n\nA strike involving charter school employees \u2015 who are deeply critical of the system in which their schools operate \u2015 only invites more criticism and is symbolic of the microscope that charters are currently under. The educators at Accelerated Charters are fighting for more job security, binding arbitration and health care benefits.\n\nAl Seib via Getty Images Educators picket outside the Accelerated Charter Schools building. Among the protesters were teachers from the network's schools, who started their own strike on Jan. 15.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things [LAUSD teachers are] asking for are things that we need but can\u2019t ask for because we don\u2019t have job security,\u201d said Julia Weinrott, a fourth-grade teacher at an Accelerated school who protested on Tuesday morning with nearly all her colleagues.\n\nThe CEO of Accelerated Charter Schools has expressed disappointment with the move, saying it puts \u201cour students and families in the middle of contract demands, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nA lot of the things [LAUSD teachers are] asking for are things that we need but can\u2019t ask for because we don\u2019t have job security. Julia Weinrott, fourth-grade teacher at an Accelerated charter school\n\nLAUSD union leaders have framed their strike as a fight for the future of public education, one in which the creeping influence of charter schools is kept at bay. Union leaders have connected the district\u2019s vast financial problems \u2015 resulting in chronically understaffed and underresourced schools \u2014 with the growth of charter schools.\n\nThe first charter school in the country opened only in 1992, and since then, their numbers have grown at a rapid clip, especially in Los Angeles. Charter schools are publicly funded and privately run and therefore are not subject to all the same regulations and red tape as traditional public schools.\n\nLAUSD educators who are on strike this week say that the system is unfair \u2015 that when students transfer to charter schools, they take with them their per-pupil funding, leaving behind fixed infrastructure costs and draining a system that is designed to educate all students.\n\nBut painting charter schools as at the root of the LAUSD\u2019s fiscal issues might be misleading, said Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.\n\nShe has studied an independent financial review of the district from 2015. It\u2019s true that the district\u2019s traditional public schools are losing students at an alarming rate, but only half those kids are leaving for charters. The other shifts are due to demographic changes or students leaving the district for any number of other reasons.\n\n\u201cI understand people being angry and confused, because it is complicated. But once you dig into the facts, charters didn\u2019t cause this problem,\u201d said Lake.\n\nAnd much of the district\u2019s financial woes can be attributed to mounting employee-related costs, like retiree benefits, amid an aging workforce. At the same time, the district receives comparatively little funding compared with others of its size around the country.\n\nStill, there\u2019s evidence that students in Los Angeles charter schools are outperforming their peers at traditional public schools. One study found that students in L.A. charter schools receive the equivalent of 50 more days in reading instruction and 79 days in math than their counterparts in traditional public schools.\n\nBut from an optics perspective, the reputational damage to charters may already be taking a toll. Throughout the week, a number of high-profile Democrats, some of whom are likely looking to run for president in 2020, tweeted their support for striking teachers.\n\nNo teacher should ever have to scrape by or be forced to take on a second job just to pay the bills. Motivating and encouraging students to be a better version of themselves deserves respect and decent wages.

Speakers and performers gave emotional accounts of the lot public school students have been handed.\n\nThe scene looked like an ocean of red-clad educators, who wore the color in solidarity with the national Red for Ed movement, as they danced with tambourines and chanted in unison, \u201cThe world is watching.\u201d Speakers bashed Los Angeles Schools Superintendent Austin Beutner \u2015 referred to as \u201cbillionaire Beutner\u201d \u2015 who is supportive of charter schools, as well as the major donors who have funneled money to pro-charter candidates on the district school board.\n\nThe crowd, including parents and students, was roaring.\n\n\u201cThe politics around charter schools are going to really shift in California. And the union senses it. They are really vulnerable now,\u201d said Pedro Noguera, a distinguished professor of education at UCLA, noting the election of union-backed candidates like Gov. Gavin Newsom and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond.\n\nBut for students, the issue may feel far more nuanced. Carla Rodriguez, a senior at the Edward R. Roybal Learning Center, a traditional public school, rallied at City Hall in support of her teachers Monday.

Scott Applewhite/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) speaks on Capitol Hill in January 2012. He has recruited more than 200 co-sponsors for his Social Security 2100 bill expanding Social Security benefits.\n\nIn less than a decade, mainstream Democrats in Congress have gone from entertaining Social Security cuts to almost universally endorsing the program\u2019s expansion.\n\nWith Democrats in charge of the House for the first time since this tidal shift upended party orthodoxy, senior members of Congress are setting the stage for the legislative chamber to increase Social Security benefits, bringing a onetime liberal pipe dream a step closer to law.\n\nDemocratic Reps. John Larson (Conn.), Conor Lamb (Pa.) and Jahana Hayes (Conn.) are introducing the Social Security 2100 Act on Wednesday, legislation that would expand Social Security benefits across the board and prolong the program\u2019s solvency for the next 75 years and beyond. The legislation finances a more generous benefit and cost-of-living adjustment formula, a reduction in income taxes on benefits and the closure of Social Security\u2019s long-term funding gap by lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes and raising those tax rates.\n\nThe bill is being rolled out on the 137th birthday of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who established Social Security as part of his New Deal in 1935.\n\nThe bill already has the support of more than 200 House Democrats, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D), who relied on Social Security payments to help pay for college after his father died.\n\nThat puts the bill just shy of the 218-vote mark it would need to pass the House.\n\nLarson introduced identical legislation during the last Congress, when GOP rule ensured it was dead on arrival. As incoming chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security, he is now equipped to shepherd its passage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the wilderness since 2010. This is a great opportunity,\u201d Larson said.\n\nLarson expressed confidence that the legislation would pass on the House floor after going through the standard legislative process, complete with hearings that shed light on the issue of retirement security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the grassroots effort that\u2019s gone into this,\u201d he said, singling out the contributions of Social Security Works and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn the Senate, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have sponsored a companion bill, but Republican control almost certainly precludes it from consideration. The legislation\u2019s passage in the House is nonetheless an opportunity for Democrats to showcase what they would deliver if they had unified control of the federal government.\n\nPeople are OK taking a little bit of the burden on themselves as long as they understand we\u2019re dedicating the money to Social Security. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.)\n\nThe legislation raises benefits by creating a minimum payment that\u2019s 25 percent greater than the federal poverty level as well as modestly adjusting the benefit formula so that more of a person\u2019s pre-retirement income will be replaced. Larson estimates that the new benefit formula would increase the average payout by 2 percent. His legislation would not change the age at which a retiree can collect benefits.\n\nThe legislation also replaces the consumer price index, used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), with an index that better reflects seniors\u2019 expenses, particularly the higher costs of health care. The Social Security Administration\u2019s chief actuary projects that the bill\u2019s Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) would, on average, increase the COLA by about 0.2 percent.\n\nTo finance the ambitious legislation, Larson would subject earnings of $400,000 or more to the Social Security payroll tax.\n\nCurrently, Americans pay Social Security taxes only on the first $132,900 that they earn based on a cap that rises with average wage growth. The new legislation would leave income between $132,900 and $400,000 untaxed. Over time, the present-day cap would rise to $400,000, at which point all earnings would be subject to the tax.\n\nLarson\u2019s legislation would also raise the payroll tax by 1.2 percentage points on both employees and employers, phasing in the change over 24 years.\n\nAt the same time, the bill cuts income taxes on Social Security benefits for those who receive them by raising the income threshold at which they would be taxed. Under the legislation, 12 million beneficiaries \u2015 out of nearly 63 million total \u2015 would receive a tax cut, according to Larson.\n\nStill, the bill\u2019s payroll tax increase is likely to be the biggest political challenge for Larson and other Democrats trying to advance the bill.\n\nTo try to preempt that line of attack, Larson is fond of brandishing a Starbucks cup at every event promoting the bill. He calculates that for a worker making $50,000 a year, the tax hike amounts to just 50 cents a week \u2015 or one $4.50 cup of Starbucks every nine weeks.\n\nLarson, who represents Hartford, known as the nation\u2019s insurance capital, also wants Americans to view payroll taxes as an insurance premium rather than a tax, noting that its official name is FICA, or the Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax.\n\nIt helps Larson\u2019s case that his allies hail from ideologically diverse branches of the party. The co-chairs of the House\u2019s Expand Social Security Caucus that Larson started in September include Reps. Debbie Dingell (Mich.) and Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.), members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition; and Lamb, who does not belong to any ideologically driven bloc.\n\nLamb, perhaps more than anyone, attests to the low political risk of backing higher Social Security taxes to pay for solvency and benefit expansion. He endorsed the policy during his March special election win in a southwest Pennsylvania district where Donald Trump won by more than 19 percentage points in 2016.\n\n\u201cPeople are OK taking a little bit of the burden on themselves as long as they understand we\u2019re dedicating the money to Social Security,\u201d he said.\n\nLamb referred to his co-sponsorship of the bill as the fulfillment of a campaign promise and said he wants whoever the Democratic presidential nominee is to endorse the legislation.\n\nBecause Social Security is statutorily prohibited from borrowing to pay benefits, it faces a funding shortfall as more baby boomers retire in the coming years.\n\nSocial Security is projected to have enough revenue to pay out full benefits until 2034, according to the program\u2019s nonpartisan actuaries. After that, absent legislation tweaking the program\u2019s finances, it will only be able to pay out about three-quarters of promised benefits.\n\nConservatives tend to favor closing Social Security\u2019s funding gap through benefit cuts; progressives prefer plans that raise more revenue for the program.\n\nBut Larson\u2019s bill represents the culmination of efforts by left-leaning groups to look at Social Security as an essential vehicle for retirement security in a time of stagnant wages, depleted home equity and volatile 401(k) plans.\n\nThe average monthly Social Security benefit is just under $1,250. Without it, 22 million more Americans would live in poverty.\n\nLarson holds out some hope that President Donald Trump, who promised to protect Social Security from cuts as a candidate, might strike a deal to close Social Security\u2019s funding gap with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The Connecticut congressman compared the unlikely duo to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s partnership with House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill (D-Mass.) in 1983, the last time Congress passed legislation reforming Social Security.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/william-barr-robert-mueller-probe-trump-attorney-general_us_5c3d0929e4b0e0baf5404453": "WASHINGTON \u2015 William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t believe Robert Mueller \u201cwould be involved in a witch hunt\u201d and pledged to act with independence and not fire the special counsel without due cause.\n\nWhile Barr committed to seeking the advice of career Justice Department ethics officials on whether he should recuse himself from the Mueller probe because of his past comments, Barr said he would make the decision himself \u201cin good faith,\u201d based on the laws and facts.\n\nBarr, a 68-year-old who first served as attorney general during George H.W.

Those categories were economy, jobs, terrorism, budget deficit, helping the middle class, Supreme Court appointments, health care, international crises, race relations and women\u2019s issues.\n\nAmericans\u2019 largest disappointment within these categories was with Trump\u2019s handling of the budget deficit \u2015 with 50 percent of respondents polled in 2017 expecting him to do an excellent or good job with it, compared to 33 percent of respondents expressing this same view today.\n\nAmericans\u2019 expectation of how he would handle international crises was most closely met, with 44 percent saying in 2017 that he would do an excellent or good job compared to 43 percent saying the same this year.\n\nThe ABC News-Washington Post poll also registered negativity for members of Congress.\n\nThe poll found that 29 percent of responders have no confidence \u201cat all\u201d in Democrats, while 30 percent said the same of Republicans. On the flip side, 34 percent said they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or a \u201cgood amount\u201d of confidence in Democrats in Congress, while 30 percent said the same about Republicans.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also received a low confidence rating, with 37 percent of responders saying they have no confidence in her and 30 percent saying they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or a \u201cgood amount.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rodney-davis-flying-first-class-ggovernment-shutdown_us_5c477fe1e4b083c46d634be8": "WASHINGTON \u2015 With President Donald Trump and the GOP prolonging the partial government shutdown, a Republican lawmaker had an uncomfortable run-in Tuesday when a fellow airplane passenger found him flying first class from Chicago to Washington, D.C., according to a video of the encounter shared with HuffPost.\n\n\u201cCongressman, do you think it\u2019s appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren\u2019t being paid?\u201d the person says to Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in an apparent reference to the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s 57,000 employees, who are being required to work without pay.\n\nA tipster who asked to remain anonymous shared the video with HuffPost, which hasn\u2019t been able to identify the person who approached Davis.\n\nDavis remained silent, prompting the person to say, \u201cTaking that as a yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaxpayers paid for this flight? Fair enough,\u201d he added.\n\nMembers of Congress can have the government pay for regular flights to and from their home jurisdictions, as maintaining constituency contact is part of their job. Unlike the paychecks of TSA workers, as well as those of hundreds of thousands of other federal government workers affected by the shutdown, those paid flights do not go away during a government shutdown.\n\nDavis did not use his taxpayer-provided budget to purchase a first-class ticket and has never done so, his spokeswoman Ashley Phelps told HuffPost in an email.\n\nHis office bought a regular coach ticket, but he was upgraded automatically because of his frequent flyer status, she added. \u201cThere was no additional cost to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nAccepting the upgrade is not a violation of anti-corruption rules because it\u2019s something available to any person who accrues a certain number of miles and wasn\u2019t offered exclusively to Davis because of his position as an elected representative, an ethics officer in the House, who asked to speak on background since the episode is not under any official investigation, told HuffPost.\n\nAll the same, for someone with power over people\u2019s paychecks to enjoy a luxe experience amid mass economic disruption makes for a jarring sight.\n\nA photograph of Davis in the first class section of the plane made it into Politico\u2019s Playbook PM newsletter on Tuesday.\n\nMost of the GOP has stood with President Donald Trump during the shutdown, arguing that he\u2019s right to reject deals to reopen the government until he gets the funding he wants for his promised wall on the border with Mexico.\n\nDavis has frequently supported the party on the issue, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, and praised Trump\u2019s approach. But the congressman recently sided with Democrats on bills to reopen some agencies \u2015 a nod, perhaps, to his political vulnerability, given his tight re-election in the 2018 midterms.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-initiative_us_5c50b08ee4b0f43e410bcbc4": "NOAH BERGER via Getty Images California\u2019s Sen.

So the woman was charged.\n\n\u201cBy shining this infrared spotlight of public safety on the fact that her children aren\u2019t in school, we were able to figure that out, get her access to services that exist, and through that process, the attendance of her children improved. We dismissed the charges against her, and overall we\u2019ve improved attendance for this population in SF by 20 percent over the last two years.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris continued on to describe how she'd brought charges against a single homeless mother of 3 who was working 2 jobs because her children were truant...and this was a success story. pic.twitter.com/FT5uJmI6x9 \u2014 Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) January 28, 2019\n\nIn the speech, Harris laughs about sending her office\u2019s homicide and gang prosecutors into San Francisco schools to meet with parents and administrators who were discussing truant students.\n\n\u201cWhen you go over there, look really mean,\u201d she said she would tell them.\n\nIn Bragman\u2019s thread, he pointed out that Harris\u2019 speech was a stump speech for her 2010 re-election campaign for attorney general.

Its critics pointed out that it predominantly affected poor communities and communities of color.\n\n\u201cShe believed a critical way to keep kids out of jail when they\u2019re older is to keep them in school when they\u2019re young,\u201d a campaign spokesperson told HuffPost on Tuesday.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign pointed to the social service aspect of the initiative, saying that arrests and other interactions with the criminal justice system were minimal and that the initiative forced schools to work more closely with parents of struggling children \u2015 and support those parents too.\n\n(When Harris was attorney general, several parents were arrested for their kids\u2019 chronic truancy.)\n\nIn a town hall on CNN on Monday, she defended her criminal justice background.\n\nAsked about her \u201ccontradictory\u201d career as a prosecutor, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been consistent my whole career.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-accuses-michael-cohen-of-lying_us_5c41f2b2e4b027c3bbc144a1": "President Donald Trump attacked his former personal attorney after a bombshell report from BuzzFeed News that the president directed Cohen to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow.\n\nIn a tweet Friday, Trump quoted a Fox News talking head before saying that Cohen was \u201clying to reduce his jail time!\u201d\n\nKevin Corke, @FoxNews \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....\u201d Lying to reduce his jail time!
