{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The states that have now joined the suit are New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia and Michigan.\n\nAfter failing to obtain congressional support for a spending bill that included $5.7 billion in funding to begin building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, then signing a bill that included $1.375 billion for border security, the president declared a national emergency last week so he could go around the legislative branch to secure billions more that he says is needed to start work on the barrier.\n\n\u201cContrary to the will of Congress, the President has used the pretext of a manufactured \u2018crisis\u2019 of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,\u201d the lawsuit states. The suit also alleges Trump has veered the country toward \u201ca constitutional crisis of his own making,\u201d adding that a national emergency declaration is not necessary, by the president\u2019s own admission.\n\nWhen making the declaration last week, Trump admitted he \u201cdidn\u2019t need to\u201d declare a national emergency to build the border wall, but he wanted to \u201cdo it much faster.\u201d Critics quickly noted the president\u2019s own words could be used against him in court.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra led the coalition of states to file the suit, tweeting on Monday that they are challenging Trump\u2019s \u201d#FakeNationalEmergency,\u201d which he described as a \u201cbrazen overreach to rob taxpayers & an insult to the Democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution.\u201d\n\nMore details: on #PresidentsDay, @CAgovernor & I filed a lawsuit w/15 states to challenge President Trump\u2019s #FakeNationalEmergency, a brazen overreach to rob taxpayers & an insult to the Democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution. #NoWall https://t.co/eB9pUZaZQs \u2014 Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) February 19, 2019\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Becerra added, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the president is trying to usurp Congress\u2019s authority. The president does not have the power of the purse.\u201d\n\nThe federal lawsuit is the latest in what\u2019s expected to be a series of legal challenges of the president\u2019s emergency declaration. On Friday, the same day Trump declared a national emergency, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a suit claiming the Department of Justice failed to produce the requisite documents justifying the president\u2019s declaration. The American Civil Liberties Union also plans to sue the administration, arguing that Trump cannot legally use the emergency declaration to circumvent Congress for funding a border wall.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-stone-judge-instagram_n_5c6b1233e4b0b9cc78ff507e": "Roger Stone \u2015 the Republican strategist and Donald Trump associate indicted on charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2015 went after the federal judge presiding over his case on Instagram, publishing her picture next to what appeared to be an image of crosshairs and begging for money from his followers.\n\nIn a message that was posted, lambasted, deleted, edited, reposted and re-deleted over the course of a few hours on Monday, Stone claimed that \u201cDeep State hitman Robert Mueller\u201d assigned him Judge Amy Berman Jackson \u201cthrough legal trickery.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s attorneys later in the day filed a \u201cNotice of Apology\u201d from Stone to the judge. \u201cPlease inform the Court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted,\u201d Stone wrote in a signed letter in the document. \u201cI had no intention of disrespecting the Court and humbly apologize to the Court for the transgression.\u201d\n\nThe photo of Jackson, which appears to have originated from an anti-Semitic conspiracy blog, featured the words \u201cCorruption Central\u201d and an image of what appear to be crosshairs next to her head.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-andrew-mccabe_n_5c6a93e4e4b01757c36d7ef0": "Hours after \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired a bombshell interview with former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, President Donald Trump accused the ousted official of peddling lies.\n\n\u201cHe was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged,\u201d Trump wrote in a Monday morning tweet, claiming it appeared McCabe had been \u201cplanning a very illegal act\u201d with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what \u201cillegal act\u201d the president might have been referring to.\n\nWow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast.

She took many lessons from those episodes, but one of the biggest was that threatening the insurance of people with good employer benefits is a terrible idea, no matter how appealing the new alternative sounds.\n\n\u201cThere are 160 million people who get their insurance through their employer,\u201d DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, told HuffPost recently. \u201cYou cannot tell them overnight that it is gone.\u201d\n\nLots of Democrats are making similar argument these days as proposals to create a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system get serious attention and scrutiny. The proposal getting the most attention right now comes from Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who made \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. House Democrats are working on a version of their own. Progressive supporters say the approach offers the most efficient way to make sure everybody can get affordable medical care \u2015 plus, they note, it would mean ending private insurance hassles once and for all.\n\nBut enrolling everybody into a government-run insurance plan would also mean wiping away employer-sponsored coverage, and the available polling, consistent with DeLauro\u2019s viewpoint, suggests the public would be wary. That is one reason even some Democrats who endorsed \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in the past are balking at committing to it now, while others are pushing explicitly to start much more slowly \u2015 perhaps by taking one of the two big existing programs, Medicare or Medicaid, and opening them up to carefully targeted groups of people. An example is a new bill from several Democratic senators that would let people older than 50 buy into Medicare.\n\nDeLauro, whose district includes some of the most liberal-leaning parts of New Haven, has bigger plans in mind. Along with another House Democrat, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, DeLauro has put together a proposal that envisions more dramatic reforms than those limited Medicare or Medicaid expansion proposals would launch, even though it would stop short of the kind of immediate, wholesale transformation that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would unleash.\n\nAlex Brandon/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) wants to create a government-run program open to everybody while allowing employers to keep offering benefits if they choose.\n\nThe legislation, which DeLauro and Schakowsky are calling \u201cMedicare for America,\u201d would create a comprehensive, government-run insurance program that would replace the big existing federal programs as well as the private insurance policies that people today buy on their own. But large employers would get to keep offering private coverage, leaving employees with the choice of sticking with their company plans or moving to the new public option, where they could potentially get much lower premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLike any health care initiative, the DeLauro-Schakowsky bill would entail real and complicated trade-offs. A skeptical take on the proposal is that it\u2019s just ambitious enough to carry the same political liabilities as something like the Sanders bill but not ambitious enough to carry its strengths. \u201cMedicare for America\u201d envisions less sweeping changes than \u201cMedicare for all\u201d does, but that could mean leaving in place more of the current system's waste and complexities.\n\nA more optimistic read on the \u201cMedicare for America\u201d bill is that it could create a stable, well-functioning universal coverage scheme \u2015 one that, with maybe a few adjustments, would offer Americans the kind of financial protection and convenience that many European systems do. The possibility might be enough to make the proposal an attractive landing spot for those Democrats who crave bold action but have qualms about \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\nSome Major Disruption, But Mostly For Half The Population\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d resembles some more skeletal proposals that have been in circulation for the past year or so \u2015 from analyst and Shadowproof contributor Jon Walker, Yale University political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Center for American Progress (CAP). Those last two are not coincidental: DeLauro and Schakowsky worked with Hacker and CAP experts as they crafted the bill, which the lawmakers introduced in December.\n\nThe CAP role might rankle those progressives who consider the think-tank too timid or protective of the Democratic Party establishment. But Walker is well-known on social media for his sharp progressive posts, while Hacker is famous for his role developing, and then fighting for, a strong public option in the Affordable Care Act. All of them have long records of supporting government-run insurance, as do DeLauro and Schakowsky.\n\nThat political pedigree may explain why, for all the talk about minimizing disruption, \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would actually disrupt quite a lot. For starters, it would automatically enroll everybody who does not have employer-sponsored insurance into the newly constructed government program. That\u2019s basically half the U.S. population, including people on Medicaid or Medicare as well as those who currently buy coverage on their own, whether directly from insurers or through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges.\n\nBryan Bedder via Getty Images Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker, who fought for a public option in the Affordable Care Act, advised the lawmakers writing the new \"Medicare for America\" bill.\n\nTransferring all of those people into a new government program is no small matter and something that proponents of major health care reforms (on the political right as well as the left) frequently overlook. Medicaid, in particular, has evolved considerably in its 50 years, as lawmakers have tacked on provisions in order to address the very specific needs of the program\u2019s vulnerable populations, including the disabled and the elderly. A proposal that simply dumped these groups into a regular insurance program could easily leave them struggling to pay for care and support.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d doesn\u2019t appear to have that problem. DeLauro and Schakowsky worked closely with representatives of the disability community, who now praise the bill for its attention to their needs and its potential to improve access to care rather than diminish it. They cite, among other things, the high standard of support for people who use home- and community-based services (everything from help with bathing to job counseling) in order to live independently and stay out of institutions.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first bill that considers long-term supports and services when it thinks about universal health care,\u201d Nicole Jorwic, director of rights policy at The Arc, an organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, told HuffPost.\n\nA Big Role For Private Insurance\n\nAs for the basic medical coverage, \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would provide an insurance package that looks a lot like what the Affordable Care Act is supposed to provide, except that benefits would come directly from the government and would be considerably more generous. The difference is particularly stark for people making up to twice the poverty line, or about $50,000 in annual income for a family of four, because they would pay virtually nothing.\n\nAbove that income threshold, premiums and out-of-pocket expenses would gradually become more substantial. And although they would still compare favorably with the standard policies available through the Affordable Care Act, this is where the really big differences between the DeLauro-Schakowsky and Sanders approaches start to emerge.\n\nIn the kind of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system that Sanders envisions, nobody would pay premiums and nobody would pay out-of-pocket costs, except for some token extra charges for people who buy brand-name drugs when cheaper, equivalent generics were available. This is a point of principle for progressives who think the financial burden of health care spending should be a collective responsibility exclusively (taxes finance the system) and who fear, with good reason, that high out-of-pocket spending penalizes the poor and sick.\n\nKaren Ducey via Getty Images Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) is putting together a new version of \"Medicare for all,\" a single-payer bill, and hopes to introduce it in the next few weeks.\n\nAnother conspicuous difference between \u201cMedicare for America\u201d and \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is the role of private insurance. \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would not only allow employers to keep offering private plans. It would also allow private insurers to keep offering so-called Medicare Advantage plans that roughly one-third of seniors now use instead of traditional Medicare \u2015 and it would allow insurers to offer those plans to non-seniors as well.\n\nProponents of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d think that allowing private insurers to maintain this foothold preserves some of the worst parts of today\u2019s health care system, in part because it means doctors and hospitals must still deal with multiple payers of services. One of the clearest benefits of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is that it would vastly simplify billing, allowing hospitals to cut administrative staff and ultimately save the system money.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d wouldn\u2019t do that, at least to the same degree. Nor would it sever completely the attachment between employment and coverage: As long as some businesses kept offering plans, employers would have some role in employee benefits. Plus, there are a lot of data to suggest that government overpays insurers that provide Medicare Advantage plans, allowing them to make extra profits at taxpayer expense.\n\nKeeping the private insurance industry in the driver\u2019s seat is simply too hazardous for our health care. Adam Gaffney, Physicians for a National Health Plan\n\n\u201cThe shenanigans and gaming of wasteful privatized Medicare plans have drained the public purse for decades,\u201d Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Plan, told HuffPost. \u201cThe excess administrative costs, and profits, imposed by our fragmented system produce hundreds of billions of dollars in waste. And patients are ill-served by narrow networks of providers, and by copays and deductibles, all of which would be retained under this plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeping the private insurance industry in the driver\u2019s seat is simply too hazardous for our health care,\u201d Gaffney said.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d supporters, by contrast, figure that most private plans from employers and through Medicare Advantage provide decent coverage \u2015 good enough, at least, that the political cost of forcing people to give up those plans isn\u2019t worth the potential upside. The key, they say, is using automatic enrollment at the workplace to make sure everybody really gets insurance, holding private plans to high standards, scrutinizing those Medicare Advantage plans more carefully and then making sure everybody has the opportunity to move into the public alternative \u2015 where premiums and out-of-pockets could end up being a lot lower because of the sliding income scale.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who collaborated with DeLauro on the \"Medicare for America\" bill, is a longtime advocate of government-run insurance.\n\nThis does not amount to a guarantee that people will get their current plans, as Obama infamously promised about the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s more like a vow to make sure everybody has access to coverage at least as good as most employer plans today \u2015 with an openly stated hope that a well-performing public plan would either force private insurers to keep up or force them to abandon the business.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who is frustrated with their private insurance, this plan would provide an immediate off-ramp,\u201d said Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at CAP. \u201cThe 150 million workers with employer coverage can move over at their own pace, whether they\u2019re fed up with their private insurance right now or prefer to wait until the Medicare plan is proven to work well. ... In other words, private insurance would no longer be a necessity.\u201d\n\nAs Charles Gaba, the Michigan-based analyst who runs ACAsignups.net, put it recently, the goal of \u201cMedicare for America\u201d is to make the new government program \u201cmandatory for roughly half the country (those least likely to object) but completely optional for the other half (those most likely to object).\u201d\n\nGovernment Control Of Prices, In A Roundabout Way\n\nA key ingredient in other nations\u2019 successful health care systems, which reformers in this country frequently cite as models, is government control of budgets and prices. That\u2019s why all of those countries are able to cover everybody with so much less money than the U.S. devotes to heath care.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d proposes to fix this by, in effect, setting a loose upper limit on doctor and hospital charges while allowing the government to negotiate drug and medical device prices. It\u2019s similar to the approach that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would take, but it would be less direct and less aggressive.\n\nWhere the Sanders proposal envisions paying hospitals at current Medicare rates, for example, the DeLauro-Schakowsky bill would establish a payment baseline that\u2019s 10 percent higher than Medicare\u2019s. That would still be less than commercial coverage, and the result would put some pressure on hospitals to lower prices, but not as much pressure as a proposal like the Sanders bill would apply.\n\nWithout that pressure, guaranteeing comprehensive benefits for so many people who don\u2019t have them would cost even more money. Exactly how much money is hard to say right now, and that is one reason it\u2019s difficult to predict with any confidence how many \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d the plan would produce.\n\nIf the DeLauro-Schakowsky proposal gets serious attention, influential groups, such as unions, will watch closely to see what it would mean for their members, many of whom have employer benefits more generous than what \u201cMedicare for America\u201d as presently written would guarantee. Groups representing the elderly citizens will be equally vigilant, checking to see how the new coverage and costs would compare to what seniors see once they are on Medicare.\n\nBut those questions don\u2019t need answers right away. With the new congressional session just starting, the presidential campaign still in its embryonic phase and opportunities to pass laws almost certainly two years away at least, bills and campaign proposals seem important primarily as markers politicians can use to signal their priorities and stake out early negotiating positions.\n\nFor anyone who is frustrated with their private insurance, this plan would provide an immediate off-ramp. Topher Spiro, Center for American Progress\n\nDeLauro and Schakowsky are now updating their bill and plan introduce the revision within the next few weeks, only this time with co-sponsors \u2015 and that should provide an interesting test of the concept\u2019s strength, because the latest version of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d will be making its debut in the House at around the same time.\n\nThe old House version of the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill got 124 co-sponsors. Aides to Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Washington state Democrat crafting its revision, have said their goal for now is merely to get more than 100 \u2015 a sign, perhaps, that finding co-sponsors is getting a little harder now that an endorsement is more than symbolic.\n\nAs it happens, one House Democrat who plans to sign on is Schakowsky, even though she also remains committed to promoting the bill she wrote with DeLauro. \u201cI will work towards passage of \u2018Medicare for America\u2019 in this Congress, as well as any other health reform proposals that improve health equity, access, and quality,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cWith a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, I am glad we can finally work on building upon the Affordable Care Act instead of fighting endless Republican attempts to tear it down.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-stronger-together_us_5c626321e4b028d543175fde": "A line from President Donald Trump\u2019s speech on border security on Monday was quickly turned into a graphic by the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only getting stronger together,\u201d Trump said at an event in El Paso.\n\nJust one problem: \u201cStronger Together\u201d was actually Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan as well as the title of the book she wrote with running mate Sen.

In a CBS News interview days later, Trump bemoaned Pelosi\u2019s unwavering position on the matter, complaining that \u201cshe was very rigid\u201d during talks to reopen the government.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monica-lewinsky-bill-clinton-nonapology_us_5beabdabe4b0783e0a1c0e50": "More than 20 years after she began facing public humiliation and demonization because of her affair with then-President Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky has become a prominent voice in reflecting on the ways powerful men abuse their positions over less powerful women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,\u201d she wrote in March for Vanity Fair. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances \u2014 and the ability to abuse them \u2014 do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)\u201d\n\nIn a new Vanity Fair essay published Tuesday, Lewinsky again examines this disparity in power as she explains why she decided to relive the painful memories of her experience for a forthcoming documentary series airing on A&E.\n\nCentral to her decision to participate was being able to redefine the narrative about herself, she wrote, noting how Clinton\u2019s position of power has allowed him to escape the same levels of public scrutiny.\n\nA recent example: Clinton\u2019s continued refusal to personally apologize to her and accept responsibility for contributing to her public humiliation, which he demonstrated during a combative interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show in June.\n\nThis summer, Clinton participated in a number of interviews to promote a book with author James Patterson. In several of them, the former president appeared to be caught off guard by questions about the Me Too movement and gave tone-deaf answers, despite Me Too bringing an increased focus on and a re-examination of his affair with Lewinsky, as well as the multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nAs it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\" Monica Lewinsky\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what power looks like, watch a man safely, even smugly, do interviews for decades, without ever worrying whether he will be asked the questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d Lewinsky wrote of Clinton.\n\nIn the \u201cToday\u201d interview, an indignant Clinton asserted to host Craig Melvin that he did not owe Lewinsky an apology. But Lewinsky wrote that the problem with his response was less about the apology directly and more about his insistence that he need not apologize.\n\n\u201cWhat feels more important to me than whether I am owed or deserving of a personal apology is my belief that Bill Clinton should want to apologize. I\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be a better man for it ... and we, in turn, a better society.\u201d\n\nAnother example of the disparate power dynamic, according to Lewinsky, is how at the time of the affair, Clinton\u2019s position of power protected him from experiencing as much public humiliation as she did.\n\nRecalling his infamous Oval Office declaration that he \u201cdid not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d which turned out to be a lie, she said that at the time, she thought it was good that he was not planning to resign.\n\n\u201cForty-five-year-old me sees that footage very differently,\u201d she wrote Tuesday. \u201cI see a sports coach signposting the playbook for the big game. Instead of backing down amid the swirling scandal and telling the truth, Bill instead threw down the gauntlet that day in the Oval Office: \u2018I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\u2019 With that, the demonization of Monica Lewinsky began. As it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\u201d\n\nIn the essay, Lewinsky also explores how our public narratives are often shaped by men, as was the case with the coverage of her and Clinton\u2019s affair \u2014 \u201chistory literally being written by men,\u201d she wrote, explaining that she appreciated that the A&E docuseries \u201cembodies a woman\u2019s gaze,\u201d with a majority of the editors and producers being women.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monica-lewinsky-shares-new-details-of-her-affair-with-bill-clinton_us_5bed757ee4b09f4670078aa1": "\u201cI\u2019m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,\u201d she wrote in the essay. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.

People felt she was qualified and personable and highly knowledgeable, but she just didn\u2019t have that \u2026presidential vibe.\n\n\u201cI used to have people say to me, \u2018I like everything about you but you don\u2019t sound like the others, you don\u2019t look like the others,\u2019\u201d Schroeder recently told HuffPost. \u201c\u2018The problem is, you don\u2019t look presidential.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem that when women seek the highest political offices, they are portrayed as too ambitious, too ruthless, less likable. Clinton, for example, was always most popular when she was settled into a role (like when she was a New York senator or secretary of state) or while assisting a more powerful man in some capacity (like when she was first lady... or secretary of state). When she left Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet in 2013, she was the most popular politician in the country, with an approval rating of 69 percent. But when she dared to ask for more power, her approval ratings plummeted. In February 2016, in the midst of her run for president, her approval rating hovered just above 40 percent.\n\nWhen more than one woman steps up and asks for power, it becomes harder to dismiss sexist critiques of and reactions to that ambition. As the first woman to officially announce her candidacy, Warren\u2019s likability was quickly called into question. (Ironically, during the 2016 election, many had declared that Warren would be the natural antidote to Clinton\u2019s unlikability.) \u201cI\u2019ll Say It. Elizabeth Warren Isn\u2019t Likeable,\u201d declared Matt Lewis in The Daily Beast. \u201cHow does Warren avoid a Clinton redux \u2014 written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?\u201d asked Politico. \u201cIs Elizabeth Warren Actually \u2018Unlikeable\u2019\u201d? echoed Vanity Fair.\n\nBut now that there are at least four women in the race, the knee-jerk critiques seem to have \u2015 at least temporarily \u2015 slowed. The media promptly denounced a (favorable) comment about Gillibrand\u2019s likability at her first post-announcement press event. And Harris\u2019 announcement wasn\u2019t followed in the press by any caveats about her ambition or likability. (Progress!)\n\nIt remains to be seen how gender will play out in the Democratic primary. There is still a fear among women who work in the political sphere that the media may try to frame healthy debate between the female candidates as some sort of \u201ccat fight.\u201d And Reynolds told HuffPost that EMILY\u2019s List has already received questions about whether the women running will simply cannibalize each other\u2019s votes.\n\nIf a woman does end up facing off against Trump in the general election, there is certainly still a chance that sexism could actively hurt her chances at defeating him. After all, his brazen toxic masculinity is undoubtedly a part of his appeal to his base. But these difficult-to-navigate transitional moments in history are a necessary part of increasing representation in the long run. We will not create a wider vision of what a president could look like and who should be allowed to desire that role until more individuals who fall outside of that mold step up and run.\n\n\u201cWe [at EMILY\u2019s List] are firm believers [that] every woman [who] runs makes it easier for the next woman,\u201d said Reynolds, \u201cin part because it changes the way we look at candidates.\u201d\n\nAnd because it changes what \u201ccandidate\u201d looks like.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-podesta-roger-stone_us_5c515488e4b0d9f9be6a7f11": "Though Roger Stone once claimed John Podesta\u2019s \u201ctime in the barrel\u201d was on its way, it appears the former Hillary Clinton campaign chair is having the last laugh.\n\nIn a CNN interview Tuesday, Podesta revealed he felt some schadenfreude about the arrest of President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime ally, watching with a grin as it all went down on national television last Friday.\n\n\u201cVengeance doesn\u2019t run deep in my veins, but I had a smile on my face then because I think Stone has been lying for a very long time and I think it\u2019s finally caught up with him,\u201d he told anchor Erin Burnett.\n\nPodesta called Stone\u2019s seven-count indictment \u201creally devastating,\u201d noting it is based on a cache of the political operative\u2019s communications, including texts and emails.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s in a whole world of hurt...I think that barrel that he finds himself in is about to go over Niagara Falls.\u201d\n\nThe indictment assembled by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigative team accuses Stone of digging for WikiLeaks intel at the direction of an individual high within Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, although the person\u2019s identity remains unknown to the public.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2016, WikiLeaks\u2019 email dump targeting the Democratic National Committee released a trove of Podesta\u2019s emails in an attempt to thwart the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe charges Stone is facing include witness tampering, obstruction of justice and lying to Congress.\n\nSince his arrest, he has railed against the feds\u2019 use of force, racking up a series of cable news interviews in which he has emphatically claimed to be the victim of a setup.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anthony-weiner-released-prison_n_5c6991d3e4b033a799439ba6": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Former Congressman Anthony Weiner, seen in 2017, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for sending sexually explicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl.\n\nFormer Congressman Anthony Weiner has reportedly been released from prison early after serving time for sending sexually explicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe 54-year-old was released from the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, and transferred to a re-entry center in New York, the New York Post reported Sunday.\n\nHe was sentenced in November 2017 to 21 months in prison over the sexting scandal but was released early due to good behavior.\n\nTMZ reported that he is expected to be released back into society in May, after spending the next several months in either a halfway house or home confinement.\n\nHe must register as a sex offender, pay a $10,000 fine and complete three years of supervised release, according to the terms of his sentence.\n\nWeiner\u2019s incredible fall from grace saw him go from a rising Democratic congressman, New York City mayoral candidate and the husband of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin to a convicted sex offender.\n\nDennis Van Tine/MediaPunch/IPx Weiner is seen announcing his resignation from Congress in 2011 after admitting to sending lewd photos of himself on Twitter to multiple women.\n\nAfter more than a decade in the House of Representatives, Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after he was caught exchanging sexually explicit photos with women on social media.\n\nIn 2013, while running for NYC mayor, he was again caught sexting a 23-year-old woman while using the name Carlos Danger.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-film-2018-beautiful-clutter_us_5b6aa7ece4b0b15abaa8736a": "In \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d chaos fills the screen. Cash, on the first day of his new telemarketing job, makes his first call. Someone picks up. Suddenly, he\u2019s falling out of his cubicle in some gray office building, directly into the home of the person he\u2019s calling, whereupon he starts pitching the guy from across his breakfast table. In another scene, a riot breaks out on the streets of Oakland, where eight-foot-tall horsemen clash with police. It\u2019s beautiful clutter.\n\nBoots Riley, a musician and the writer-director of the film, put me onto the idea of beautiful clutter this year. Beautiful clutter, according to him, is the primary aesthetic of the surreal, absurdist adventure that was his film about a down-on-his-luck dude (played by Lakeith Stanfield) who moves up in the telemarketing world thanks to an ability to code-switch into the perfect \u201cwhite voice.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s influences cover the cultural map, from the artwork of Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence to the funk music of George Clinton to novelists like Toni Morrison and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez \u2014 artists who he said capture a sense of things \u201cstacked and layered upon each other,\u201d a feeling of \u201croughness and raggedy,\u201d \u201csome aggression, some messiness,\u201d something with the coarse thickness of life itself.\n\nRiley makes beautiful clutter just talking about beautiful clutter. Here\u2019s how he described it to me in an interview:\n\nThere are writers that are great writers, and then some of them might be a little bit more basic. They might say, \u201cHe walked to the store.\u201d But someone like a Toni Morrison might be like, \u201cHe walked slowly to the store, holding in his left hand the cup that his grandmother had, 20 years before, murdered his grandfather with. In the cup was the coffee from last night that he was doggedly determined to finish.\u201d Or something like that. Cinematically, most producers would say, \u201cDon\u2019t even say he walked to the store, just show him at the store.\u201d Right? And many times they\u2019re right. I\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s a wrong way to do it, but when you do that, then all of a sudden, 10 pages later, you find yourself in a situation where now you\u2019re forcing someone to say, you know, that 20 years ago his grandmother murdered his grandfather. You\u2019re sitting there thinking they\u2019ve been knowing each other all their lives, why are they saying is now? So there\u2019s ways to put information in that makes you reflect off of things and gives meaning to things. And so that, that sort of literary thing is what I was going for aesthetically. ... I wanted [the movie] to feel cluttered and beautiful and, I mean, like real life is.\n\nRiley sees this as a quintessentially black aesthetic, and 2018 bore him out. This was the year of beautiful clutter in black TV and film. It was the year that gave us TV shows like \u201cRandom Acts of Flyness\u201d and \u201cAtlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season,\u201d movies like Riley\u2019s, \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d and \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d I\u2019m thinking in particular of the hazy memories and layered soundscape in \u201cBeale Street,\u201d the frenetic energy of \u201cRandom Acts,\u201d the \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d-by-way-of-Buckhead weirdness of \u201cAtlanta.\u201d In their mix of surrealism, satire and languid nonconformity, all these projects marked if not a shift in black filmmaking, then at least an embrace of a different, more challenging, more cluttered approach to themes of race and black identity.\n\nIt used to be that mainstream movies that addressed race in any way tended to be somber affairs centering the emotions of the white audience. The tone of these movies flowed from that emphasis on white feeling: They were straightforward, paint by numbers, rooted in a sanitized vision of American life, presented in the style of the kind of prestige filmmaking designed expressly to catch the attention of all-white awards academies.\n\nIt used to be that mainstream movies that addressed race in any way tended to be somber affairs centering the emotions of the white audience.\n\nIn these movies, good white liberals either needed to be congratulated on their goodness or shocked into appreciating the brutality of racism. These were movies like \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d \u201cAmistad,\u201d \u201cThe Help\u201d \u2014 movies that, if they explored black life at all, explored it through the perspective of whiteness.\n\nThe popularity of \u201cThe Green Book\u201d testifies to the durability of the genre\u2019s appeal. But the difference is that in 2018, Peter Farrelly\u2019s buddy road movie had to sit uncomfortably alongside all the offerings from black directors, movies that were pitched to the sensibilities of black audiences without making any allowances for the feelings of white filmgoers, that were unconcerned with how white audiences might receive the weirdness of the work. These movies call on a rich history of Afro-surrealism, Afro-futurism, N\u00e9gritude, traditional African art and the black avant-garde. In \u201cRandom Acts of Flyness,\u201d creator, director and star Terence Nance is confronted by a white police officer and, instead of the seemingly inevitable burst of violence, he flies away. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d the music of Miles Davis is layered upon the sounds of New York City, the sound of the subway, over images of Tish\u2019s dreams and memories of her first time with Fonny \u2014 a rich visual and auditory landscape of black life. The bizarre and transcendental hover at the edges of the real and mundane.\n\n\u201cI think we all just make hypersubjective work, and we\u2019re all black, so ... we\u2019re not one thing, you know? We represent just very specific and subjective iterations of blackness globally,\u201d said Nance. \u201cDefinitely not just in America, but we represent a lot of different places, environments, migratory, transient experiences within and around the diaspora.\n\n\u201cOur first audiences is each other. Our first audience is ourselves. And we don\u2019t have to look outside of that to feel engaged and feel inspired to feel kind of aligned with the ideas, the concepts, the feeling of making and the joy of making stuff for each other. We aren\u2019t thinking about avoiding the need for that. I don\u2019t think we would know how to make something quote unquote for white people. We\u2019re not white, so we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThere was a lesson to be gleaned from all the beautiful clutter: Concerns about representation in Hollywood don\u2019t exist apart from aesthetic considerations. The past year was a great case study in the explosion of creativity, the broadening and deepening of theme and approach, that can ensue when filmmakers are liberated from the burden of being the Only One. With more new voices came more potential for new aesthetic approaches. Black cinema in 2018 revolved less around \u201clook at the bullshit we went through\u201d and delved more into questions of ramifications: How does this bullshit manifest itself in the workplace, in family dynamics, in sex?\n\nBlack filmmakers are freer to experiment with tone, with genre, with perspective, freer to speak to black audiences, freer to move beyond the question of white people altogether. It\u2019s no accident that they have tended to coalesce around the surreal, an aesthetic that lends itself most to experimentation and that mirrors the absurdity and unreality of black life.\n\nSome artists, like Spike Lee, struggle with this freedom. (In \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d based on the true story of a black police officer who infiltrated a chapter of the KKK, Lee still clings to some of the familiar tropes of visual storytelling, even as he plays for the first time with time and perspective.) Others, like Nance, have wholly embraced it.\n\nBlack filmmakers are also freer to challenge one another and be challenged. This year, Riley was called out for the one-dimensional nature of Detroit, the sole female lead in \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201d (His response was defensive, to say the least.)\n\nLater he shared his thoughts in a three-page letter posted to Twitter about Lee\u2019s flawed but exciting \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d which Riley critiqued as consisting of \u201cuntrue elements that make a cop a hero against racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Spike to come out with a movie where a story points are fabricated in order make Black cop and his counterparts look like allies in the fight against racism is really disappointing, to put it very mildly,\u201d Riley wrote.\n\nA few days later, Lee tacitly responded to these critiques in an interview with The Times of London. \u201cI\u2019m never going to say all police are corrupt, that all police hate people of color,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that. I mean, we need police.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth itself isn\u2019t much. But the fact that Lee, for so long the Only One, was being challenged in this way by another filmmaker who isn\u2019t Tyler Perry was remarkable. That it unfolded outside of the good-Negro-bad-Negro paradigm that white America has historically foisted on black cultural figures was monumental.\n\nBlack filmmakers are freer to experiment with tone, with genre, with perspective, freer to speak to black audiences, freer to move beyond the question of white people altogether.\n\nAll the old dichotomies could now be scrutinized. \u201cBeale Street\u201d director Barry Jenkins spoke of the long-standing tension for black filmmakers between a responsibility to make an argument and a dream of making art that soars beyond didacticism \u2014 \u201cthis idea,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if I\u2019m making an art film, then I have to completely divorce myself from the idea that I\u2019m making something that\u2019s a cultural work or something that has, I\u2019ll be more honest, something that has a cultural responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe rejected the notion that these two things have to be in tension. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t feel like is that if something has a cultural responsibility, then it can\u2019t be an uncompromised work of art,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s something I try to take off the table and disregard.\n\n\u201cEvery artist wrestles with it, but I do say, and maybe I shouldn\u2019t say this, but for black artists, it\u2019s something that we have to wrestle with in particular,\u201d Jenkins added. \u201cAnd for a female artist, something that they have to wrestle with in particular as well, because there\u2019s such a lack of the stories that we\u2019re telling. And now we\u2019re filling that lack, we\u2019re filling that void. And so maybe down the line, the tension between the two won\u2019t be as prevalent.\u201d\n\nWhen Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d was released in 2016, there was a lot of debate about how to categorize it. People argued about whether it was a horror movie, a comedy, a drama. Then the Golden Globes Best Musical or Comedy nomination happened, only fueling the debate. Much of that confusion comes from the way we\u2019ve been taught to view black films: that they are inherently niche, that while white-led movies fall into a basic, varied catalog of genres, black movies are a genre unto themselves.\n\n\u201cGet Out\u201d not only took on a genre many people mistakenly think can\u2019t be used as social commentary but also challenged and subverted the tropes of that genre. By doing so, it disarmed an audience that has been socialized to think that black films are only period films and biopics or Tyler Perry melodramas and that horror can\u2019t be used to elevate discussions about race.\n\nTwo years after \u201cGet Out,\u201d this potential is becoming abundantly clear. The recently released trailer for Peele\u2019s \u201cUs\u201d suggests that black filmmaking is continuing to take bold, interesting and, most of all, surreal new routes in telling black stories.\n\nThere has always been an expectation for black art to be challenging and easy, to ask the tough questions but also to provide the reassuring answers. Things are trickier now, messier. The beautiful clutter of 2018 tells us that the old model has been confounded.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-paul-manafort-prison-sentence_n_5c671b53e4b05c889d1f3cc4": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Federal prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller say former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort could spend 19 to 24 years \u2015 the rest of his life, essentially \u2015 in federal prison in connection with his convictions on several counts of fraud in connection with the money he received for his work for Ukrainian oligarchs.\n\nWhile Mueller\u2019s team \u201cdoes not take a position as to the specific sentence,\u201d they indicated they agreed that the sentencing range for Manafort\u2019s crimes would be 235 to 293 months.\n\nThe federal prosecutors also want Manafort to pay $24 million in restitution and forfeit more than $4 million.\n\n\u201cFor a decade, Manafort repeatedly violated the law,\u201d the memo states. \u201cConsidering only the crimes charged in this district, they make plain that Manafort chose to engage in a sophisticated scheme to hide millions of dollars from United States authorities.

He also suggested emulating Richard Nixon.\n\nWhen Credico texted Stone about the House intelligence committee\u2019s request for voluntary testimony in November, Stone, who worked for Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, quoted his former boss.\n\nHe wrote: \u201d\u2018Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan\u2019 ... Richard Nixon.\u201d When Credico told Stone that he was facing a subpoena, Stone pressed him to assert his 5th Amendment rights \u2015 and he did.\n\nIn related news, many photos of Stone\u2019s Nixon back tattoo emerged Friday on Twitter.\n\nCan\u2019t decide which is more disturbing, the tattoo, the fact that Nixon picture is so much bigger than Reagan, or that this now indicted guy is a close confidant and adviser to the current President of the greatest nation on earth. pic.twitter.com/myElSrq3vI \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 25, 2019\n\nAnd Stone threatened a dog.\n\nThe relationship between Stone and Credico subsequently took a downward turn, with Stone threatening the radio host\u2019s dog, Bianca.\n\n\u201cPrepare to die,\u201d Stone wrote.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn or about April 9, 2018, STONE wrote in an email to Person 2, \u201cYou are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds.\u201d STONE also said he would \u201ctake that dog away from you,\u201d referring to Person 2\u2019s dog. On or about the same day, STONE wrote to Person 2, \u201cI am so ready. Let\u2019s get it on. Prepare to die [expletive].\u201d\n\nA Trump campaign official \u201cwas directed\u201d to get in touch with Stone about the hack.\n\nThe indictment does not name specific Trump campaign officials or suggest what Trump himself may have known about Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks. But if an already \u201csenior\u201d official \u201cwas directed\u201d to contact Stone, few would presumably have the authority to do such directing.\n\nThe Trump campaign was very interested in what WikiLeaks may have mined from DNC servers.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nAfter the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.\n\nSomeone with knowledge of the DNC hack suggested putting out the message that Clinton was \u201cold, memory bad, has stroke.\u201d\n\nIn early August 2016, another person who knew about the WikiLeaks hack, referred to as Person 1, emailed Stone to say that the group planned two more information dumps. Right-wing author and birther conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Friday that the indictment referred to him.\n\n\u201cImpact planned to be very damaging,\u201d Corsi wrote, suggesting the Trump campaign push the idea that Clinton was in bad health. Trump himself peddled doubts about his opponent\u2019s health on the campaign trail, fueling a right-wing conspiracy theory.\n\nRyan Goodman, former special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense, said on Twitter that the idea could have \u201csignificant\u201d legal implications if it could be used to show coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nPerson 1 added in the same email, \u201cTime to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w 5 enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC. That appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke \u2013 neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for [Clinton] Foundation debacle.\u201d\n\nThe day Stone swore he had not texted or emailed with \u201cPerson 2,\u201d the two men exchanged 30 texts.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the very day Stone testified before the House intelligence committee that he never sent or received written communications with Credico, the pair \u201cexchanged over thirty text messages.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include Randy Credico\u2019s name as Person 2.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-one-party-rule-ends_us_5c1bf632e4b08aaf7a86858b": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans couldn\u2019t believe their luck after the 2016 elections. Many of them fully expected Hillary Clinton to become president. Instead, they found themselves with every politico\u2019s dream: one-party control of the three branches of government.\n\n\u201cWe are going to hit the ground running,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) declared, saying Donald Trump \u201cearned a mandate\u201d to push his agenda forward as president.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change the course for America,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared.\n\nTwo years later, the Republican dream is left in shambles. And voters were clearly not impressed with what the GOP Congress accomplished with its one-party rule. In January, Democrats will take control of the House.\n\nAt midnight, the federal government partially shut down for the third time during Trump\u2019s presidency after Republicans failed in their most basic duty as lawmakers: funding government operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of a sort of meltdown on the part of the Republicans,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday. Pelosi is expected to become speaker in the new Congress.\n\nRep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), however, argued that this turmoil was normal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the state legislature for 14 years, six of those as speaker. I\u2019ve been here for 20 years,\u201d he told reporters Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it not end this way. The last week of a legislative session is ugly. Always is.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not always this ugly. When then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) retired in 2015, he cleaned up the place. He pushed through a two-year spending deal and a two-year raise in the federal borrowing limit, theoretically allowing Congress to get other things done so they wouldn\u2019t have to waste time lurching from crisis to crisis.\n\nAnd the messiness wasn\u2019t restricted to this past week.\n\nFormer Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who left Congress in 2017 and recently gave up his party affiliation, said the Republican Party\u2019s unified control of government was \u201cdefined by remarkably damaging wins and complete capitulation of separation of powers.\u201d\n\nCongress spent two years behaving as a political committee of the president, not a branch of government empowered with independence by the Constitution. Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.)\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Republicans made repealing it their rallying cry. Up until the 2018 campaign, it was their central political message. But the ACA turned out to be far more popular than they anticipated and repealing it was far harder than expected as well \u2015 despite controlling both chambers of Congress. Trump and his Republican allies continue to weaken the law, but there was no all-out repeal as promised.\n\nCongress\u2019 biggest legislative accomplishment was passing the new tax law, but it fell far short of what was promised. There were deep, permanent cuts for corporations, and a more modest cut for individuals that expires at the end of 2025. The tax bill was not as popular as Republicans expected, and they largely abandoned it as a campaign message.\n\nThe tax law also contributed to a complete abandonment of the GOP\u2019s stated concern about fiscal responsibility.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was president, Republicans hammered him on the national debt. \u201cAmerica Can\u2019t Afford Obama\u2019s Legacy Of A Skyrocketing National Debt\u201d read a typical document on the Republican National Committee\u2019s website in 2017. When the national debt was at $15 trillion in 2012, Ryan warned of the \u201cred tidal wave of debt\u201d that would mean the \u201cend of the American dream\u201d in as little as two or three years.\n\nBut it\u2019s 2018, and the national debt has grown to $21 trillion under the GOP\u2019s watch. The federal government\u2019s budget office projects the GOP\u2019s tax law will add more than $1.8 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years. So much for fiscal austerity.\n\nAssociated Press Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) tenure as House speaker will be defined less by big intellectual ideas than by partisan politics and the GOP's defense of Trump.\n\nOne bright spot for Republicans is the criminal justice reform bill that passed on a strong bipartisan basis this month. The bill is designed to help nonviolent federal offenders make an easier return to society after they\u2019ve served most of their sentences. It also trimmed a handful of mandatory minimum sentences, such as for crack cocaine, that helped explode the federal prison population over the past three decades. Most Republicans probably wouldn\u2019t have supported such a bill without cover from a president like Trump, who does \u201ctough on crime\u201d politics like it\u2019s still the 1980s.\n\nThat same macho impulse, however, is what led to the government shutdown, with Trump insisting Congress appropriate billions of dollars for a giant wall to keep \u201cbad guys\u201d from crossing the southern U.S. border. It\u2019s such a ridiculous idea that Republicans in Congress try to pretend the president\u2019s talking broadly about \u201cborder security\u201d and not a physical barrier made out of concrete or steel.\n\nRyan and McConnell could have sent the president a clean funding bill and dared him to veto it \u2015 instead, they played along with his demand and made a show of holding votes, even though it was clear Democrats wouldn\u2019t go along.\n\nAnd while Senate Republicans did push through two conservative Supreme Court nominees, they largely overlooked or dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against one: Brett Kavanaugh, who was rushed ahead for confirmation without the usual vetting.\n\nBut most notably, the Republican majority will be remembered for what it didn\u2019t do: It didn\u2019t stand up to Trump.\n\n\u201cCongress spent two years behaving as a political committee of the president, not a branch of government empowered with independence by the Constitution,\u201d Jolly said.\n\nCongress never passed legislation protecting Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign. Ryan frequently dismissed Trump\u2019s concerning rhetoric and actions \u2015 like attacking fellow Republicans or outright lying \u2015 calling it \u201cnoise\u201d or \u201ctrolling.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-most-admired-woman-gallup_us_5c24e475e4b08aaf7a8e2fe9": "Former first lady Michelle Obama has been named this year\u2019s \u201cmost admired woman\u201d in Gallup\u2019s annual poll, marking the first time in 17 years that Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t nab the top spot.\n\nThe annual survey, conducted Dec. 3-12 this year, asks Americans to name the man and the woman living anywhere in the world they most admire.

So here\u2019s your guide to what\u2019s happening with the Mueller probe and what comes next.\n\nAll right, so this is all about Russian interference in the 2016 election. What have we learned about that?\n\nA decent amount so far, but we don\u2019t yet have the full picture. Much of the media coverage of the Mueller investigation has focused on the Americans in Trump\u2019s orbit who have been caught up in the probe. But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media.\n\nOne reason those cases don\u2019t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there\u2019s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they\u2019re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments \u2014 one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 \u2014 are essential parts of the Mueller probe.\n\nThe first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system\u201d and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals \u2015 most of them military intelligence officers \u2015 \u201cconducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public.\n\nOK, other than all those Russians, who in Trump\u2019s circle has Mueller indicted?\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone.\n\nThere were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don\u2019t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn\u2019t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon.\n\nWho has the Mueller investigation found committed crimes?\n\nThe special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates.\n\nManafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial.\n\nIs anyone going to prison?\n\nPapadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat about Paul Manafort?\n\nManafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time.\n\nAfter he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller\u2019s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews \u2015 committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI.\n\nHow long has this Mueller probe been going on?\n\nMueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them \u2015 named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhen is the Mueller report coming out?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it\u2019s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It\u2019s unclear what form that would take.\n\nWhat kind of operation is Mueller running?\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty tight ship. There haven\u2019t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves).\n\nHow has Trump\u2019s legal team responded?\n\nBy getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI \u2015 generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization \u2015 was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau\u2019s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton\u2019s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election.\n\nAfter the Mueller probe wraps up, is that it?\n\nNo. There have been some clear signs that Mueller\u2019s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren\u2019t on Mueller\u2019s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it\u2019s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney\u2019s office without setting off a bunch of alarms.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump\u2019s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August.\n\nSo that\u2019s how Jeff Bezos\u2019 dick pics fit into all this?\n\nRight. The Enquirer published Bezos\u2019 intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos \u2014 the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn\u2019t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There\u2019s a question whether what he calls \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d violates AMI\u2019s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let\u2019s say, a complexifier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in everything?\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2015 based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public.\n\nRosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He\u2019s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed.\n\nWho is Matt Whitaker, and how the heck did he become Rosenstein\u2019s boss?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn\u2019t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush\u2019s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe.\n\nWhere does WikiLeaks fit in?\n\nA key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails\u2019 release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election.\n\nSome of the special counsel\u2019s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone.\n\nSo what is Roger Stone charged with, exactly?\n\nMueller\u2019s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel\u2019s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering.\n\nThe indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury \u2014 referring to a scene in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to \u2014 and threatened Credico\u2019s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIs there anyone else implicated in the Roger Stone indictment?\n\nThere\u2019s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted.\n\nDraft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year.\n\n\n\nGuess we should talk more about Michael Cohen\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress.\n\nHis indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization\u2019s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted.\n\nCohen told investigators that at Trump\u2019s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nWhat ended up happening with the Moscow Trump Tower?\n\nIt never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen\u2019s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with that secret Supreme Court battle?\n\nThis one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business \u2015 called \u201cCorporation\u201d from \u201cCountry A\u201d in court filings \u2015 trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the \u201cCorporation\u201d has to comply with the subpoena, but didn\u2019t explain its decision.\n\nAll this mystery could amount to nothing \u2015 it\u2019s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation.\n\nDoes it matter that the Democrats now control the House?\n\nIt does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe. This would also potentially help bring the Mueller investigation findings into the public eye if the White House or new attorney general attempts to suppress the report.\n\nIs Don Jr. going to prison?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. isn\u2019t currently facing any charges, so at least in the short term, the answer is no. But ever since the special counsel indicted Cohen for lying to Congress, there has been an increased focus on whether Trump Jr. could face similar charges.\n\nTrump Jr. told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that he never directly or indirectly sought foreign assistance for his dad\u2019s campaign. However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion. He held a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin. Days before the meeting, an intermediary emailed Trump Jr. to let him know that a senior Russian government official was offering to provide damaging information on Clinton.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-mccabe-fbi-trump-25th-amendment_n_5c6561d4e4b0aec93d3bf72b": "Justice Department officials discussed whether Vice President Mike Pence and enough Trump Cabinet officials would deem it necessary to remove President Donald Trump from office using the 25th Amendment, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that will air Sunday.\n\nMcCabe, who took over after Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, said the conversations occurred in the days between Comey\u2019s firing and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment later that month, according to CBS correspondent Scott Pelley.\n\nMcCabe is the first official to confirm prior anonymous reports that such discussions took place.\n\n.@ScottPelley on what McCabe told @60Minutes: \"There were meetings at the Justice Department at which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment.\" pic.twitter.com/iVAyrEV4MF \u2014 Norah O'Donnell\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@NorahODonnell) February 14, 2019\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about McCabe\u2019s interview, which was taped ahead of the release of his book.\n\nIn a statement responding to the interview, the Justice Department said deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u201crejects Mr. McCabe\u2019s recitation of events as inaccurate and factually incorrect.\u201d\n\nRosenstein denied New York Times reporting in September that indicated officials had talked about using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from the White House.

Terry McAuliffe, an ally of Trump\u2019s opponent Hillary Clinton, during a 2015 Virginia state Senate campaign.\n\nMcCabe had no involvement in the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during his wife\u2019s campaign, according to FBI documents released last year.\n\nAccording to an excerpt of McCabe\u2019s forthcoming book published Thursday in The Atlantic, Trump repeatedly took pride in Comey\u2019s firing and \u201cflew off the handle,\u201d ranting to McCabe about a litany of grievances against Comey.\n\nMcCabe also compared Trump to a mob boss, writing that \u201cthe president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate.\u201d\n\nLike Comey, McCabe recalled keeping memos of his interactions with Trump so he could \u201chave a contemporaneous record of conversations with a person who cannot be trusted.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day brings a new low, with the president exposing himself as a deliberate liar who will say whatever he pleases to get whatever he wants,\u201d McCabe wrote. \u201cIf he were \u2018on the box\u2019 at Quantico, he would break the machine.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Feb. 15, 3 p.m. \u2015 McCabe\u2019s spokesman Melissa Schwartz released a statement clarifying his remarks, saying they\u2019ve been \u201ctaken out of context and misrepresented.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo clarify, at no time did Mr. McCabe participate in any extended discussions about the use of the 25th Amendment, nor is he aware of any such discussions.

Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\n\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favorite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\n\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favors,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the nonprofit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\n\nFACT was founded in 2015, tax filings show. Whitaker drew a sizable portion of its budget as his salary as president and executive director \u2014 in 2016 he earned more than twice what leaders of similar groups were paid on average that year, according to data from another watchdog group, Charity Navigator.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 percent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice president at Charity Navigator.\n\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and then primarily supported with funds from another organization called Donor\u2019s Trust. That group is a nonprofit built to give conservative and libertarian philanthropists \u201cany level of privacy they want,\u201d according to its marketing materials.\n\nA FACT spokesman declined to provide any details on donors or any on-the-record response to other questions. There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from Whitaker made through the Justice Department.\n\nThough 501c3 groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nIn 2014, FACT\u2019s only source of funds was Donor\u2019s Trust, according to IRS filings. In 2015, funds from Donor\u2019s Trust accounted for all but $191 of FACT\u2019s $500,191 in revenue. In 2016, Donor\u2019s Trust provided $800,000 of FACT\u2019s revenues of $1,350,265.\n\nIt is clear from IRS filings that FACT has paid outside Republican firms to perform some of its work. One such firm is America Rising LLC, which was given $144,000 for research in 2015.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-short-ivanka-trump-email_us_5bf40574e4b0d9e7283d1913": "A former top official in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House on Tuesday dragged Ivanka Trump\u2019s private email use for government business, calling it \u201chypocritical,\u201d given her family\u2019s hysterical reaction to the Hillary Clinton email controversy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical and certainly it looks bad,\u201d Marc Short, Trump\u2019s former legislative director, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nShort, who departed the White House in July, was one of the Trump administration\u2019s longest-serving aides.

Epstein was facing a federal indictment for trafficking and abusing minor girls for at least six years, according to a bombshell report in the Miami Herald. The FBI had identified at least three dozen girls sexually abused by Epstein, but the investigation turned up more than 100 \u201cJane Does,\u201d the Herald reports.\n\nWith Acosta\u2019s help, Epstein got off with essentially a slap on the wrist for his extraordinary crimes \u2015 a short 13-month stint in prison, which he was allowed to leave for days at a time on work release.\n\nThe victims were not even told about the plea deal, which also ensured that no one who had helped facilitate Epstein\u2019s crimes would be prosecuted. Epstein\u2019s victims never even had a chance to tell their stories, until the Miami Herald reached out and several came forward.\n\nLawyers say the deal Trump\u2019s future labor secretary clinched was extraordinarily lenient, considering the breadth of evidence involved \u2015 stories from the victims were remarkably similar and showed a clear pattern, witnesses were available, and victims were willing to come forward.\n\n\u201cThis was not a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 situation. This was 50-something \u2018shes\u2019 and one \u2018he\u2019 \u2014 and the \u2018shes\u2019 all basically told the same story,\u2019\u2019 retired Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter, who supervised the police probe, told the Miami Herald.\n\nAcosta did not respond to the Herald\u2019s press queries. In an email to HuffPost, a Labor Department spokeswoman said, \u201cThis matter has been publicly addressed previously, including during confirmation hearings.\u201d\n\nAcosta is currently on the \u201cshort list\u201d for attorney general, according to some reports.\n\nConsider Epstein\u2019s story to be the latest and possibly most egregious chapter in the long-suffering saga of rich, powerful men getting away with abusing women: From Harvey Weinstein to Les Moonves and beyond.\n\nBut in this case these weren\u2019t adult women, but children so young that some were still in braces. Epstein and his powerful defense attorneys \u2015 including Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr \u2015 argued that they were prostitutes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have every reason to believe you\u2019d put this guy away for life and put away those who helped him,\u201d Michael Dolce, a lawyer in Palm Beach, Florida, who represents sex abuse victims, told HuffPost. Dolce said he was close to speechless when he learned of Epstein\u2019s sweetheart deal.\n\n\u201cThis is breathtakingly shocking,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a sad twist, Acosta was only nominated to the position of labor secretary after Trump\u2019s first pick \u2015 Andrew Puzder, the former CEO of a burger chain \u2015 withdrew himself from consideration after reports that he\u2019d been accused of abusing his ex-wife when they were married. At the time it looked like a win for women\u2019s rights supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Acosta sailed through the nomination process fairly uneventfully \u2015 even though Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) opposed his appointment because of how he handled the Epstein case. (Though it was previously known that Acosta played a role in negotiating the deal, the details of that agreement had been kept secret until the Herald\u2019s report.)\n\nNow his name has been floated as a replacement for Jeff Sessions as attorney general.\n\nThe entire Miami Herald investigation deserves a full read, but it\u2019s worth recounting some of the details here:\n\nPolice said Epstein operated a \u201csexual pyramid scheme,\u201d in which he would recruit vulnerable young girls, many of whom were poor or had a history of family trauma, to come to his pink waterfront mansion and give him \u201cmassages\u201d while he was undressed.

As part of the deal, he agreed to cooperate and admitted making fraudulent statements in an interview with FBI agents at the White House on Jan. 24, 2017.

He seemed frustrated with many of the arguments from Flynn\u2019s team that he suggested took away from Flynn\u2019s supposed acceptance of responsibility for his crime.\n\nSullivan had Flynn admit, once again, that he had lied to the FBI and was pleading guilty because he was guilty. He gave Flynn ample opportunity to back out of his guilty plea, discussed with the prosecution the variety of other crimes Flynn could have faced, and said Flynn\u2019s criminal exposure would have been \u201csignificant\u201d had be been charged with the other offenses.\n\n\u201cThis crime is very serious,\u201d Sullivan said, noting that Flynn lied \u201cIn the White House!

That indictment, which refers to Flynn as \u201cPerson A,\u201d says that Kian and Flynn worked together on an illegal campaign to do the bidding of the Turkish government, which was seeking to extradite a cleric living in the United States that the Turkish government accused of instigating a failed coup in 2016.\n\nFlynn\u2019s attorneys had argued for leniency ahead of his sentencing.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nJust a tenth of Americans thinks the nation has gotten better at preventing gun violence since the Newtown shooting, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken following the six-year anniversary of the massacre last week. Slightly under half say the situation hasn\u2019t changed at all, while another 30 percent believe it\u2019s gotten worse.\n\nAbout half of Americans currently say it would be possible to enact some new gun regulations while maintaining Americans\u2019 right to bear arms, more than double the 22 percent who believe that any regulations would be an infringement. But only 40 percent believe that it\u2019s politically possible at this moment to pass new gun laws, with 34 percent say it\u2019s currently impossible to do so.\n\nOpinions on these, and most of the questions included in the poll, split heavily along political lines, with Hillary Clinton voters almost universally favoring action on guns and Trump voters substantially opposed to new restrictions. There\u2019s also little agreement on the scope of the issue: Eighty-seven percent of Clinton voters, but just 27 percent of Trump voters, say gun violence is a very serious problem in the country.\n\nThere are, however, some points of agreement. Slightly more than three-quarters of the American public, for instance, favors strengthening background checks for selling and buying guns. Ninety-three percent of Clinton voters support such measures, as do 69 percent of Trump voters and two-thirds of nonvoters. The majority of all three groups also believe the nation hasn\u2019t made progress in preventing gun violence.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the most recent HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nDuring that time, views have proved fluid, but they have showed little-sustained change. The belief that gun violence is a very serious problem fluctuated between 46 and 60 percent. The share of Americans who say it\u2019s politically possible to pass new gun laws has dipped as low as 32 percent, in June of last year, and risen as high as 50 percent following the Parkland shooting. Some shootings appeared to provoke no notable change in public opinion whatsoever, as measured in the HuffPost/YouGov polls.\n\nOther pollsters have found more evidence of a trend in favor of gun control. The progressive pollster Civiqs, which has also tracked opinions on gun control since 2015, finds that since the Las Vegas shooting, support has hovered in or above the low 50s, up from the mid-40s two years ago. Gallup\u2019s most recent survey, taken this fall, found that 61 percent of Americans favor stronger gun laws, up from a low of 44 percent in 2009.\n\nNearly all polling on guns, including the HuffPost/YouGov survey, measured a profound reaction to the Parkland, Florida, shooting earlier this year, which created a new crop of gun control advocates and sparked an unusually prolonged national debate about the issue. Beliefs that new gun laws were both politically possible and compatible with the Second Amendment rose sharply, as students marched on Washington demanding gun reform and President Donald Trump even briefly lent his imprimatur to some efforts. Within months, however, views began to tick downward again.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 14-16 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

One staffer for a Democratic presidential hopeful called the decision \u201cdumb & disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I won\u2019t be watching,\u201d another said.\n\nOthers who spoke to HuffPost went further.\n\n\u201cThe Schultz rollout has been an epic train wreck from a messaging and execution standpoint, and that has to be part of the appeal to the show\u2019s producers,\u201d said a Democratic adviser to one of the 2020 candidates. \u201cIf 2016 showed us anything, it\u2019s that the camera follows controversy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs someone who was on Hillary\u2019s campaign in 2016, it really feels like major media didn\u2019t learn their lesson,\u201d a different senior 2020 campaign staffer said. \u201cJust because someone says something loud doesn\u2019t mean you have to pay attention to them.\u201d\n\nLast month, CNN hosted its first town hall of the 2020 presidential cycle. In the hot seat was Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who had announced her run for president days before. The show proved to be a ratings success \u2015 \u201cthe most watched cable news single candidate election town hall ever,\u201d according to a CNN press release \u2015 and many Democrats are rankled that the next one has gone to Schultz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd that they are giving a stage to someone who is not even an announced candidate yet, before they\u2019ve given a stage to all of the top-tier Democratic candidates in a Democratic primary,\u201d said one Democratic strategist.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Monday that at least three Democrats who have officially announced their candidacy for president have not received formal invitations to participate in a CNN town hall \u2015 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).\n\n\u201cOnce again,\u201d the strategist said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see a presidential race that is going to be treated as entertainment.\u201d\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment, but the network has reached out to at least one new Democratic candidate for a town hall since the Schultz town hall was announced last week, a source said. Additionally, CNN announced Monday that it will host a town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) next week.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s hard for Petkanas and others working within the Democratic Party not to wonder whether the same media dynamics that propelled Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016 have kicked into high gear once more. By the time Trump announced he was running for president almost four years ago, he had already been gifted years of free news coverage, which he used to push Obama-focused conspiracy theories and inflate his own brand.\n\n\u201cWhen he announced [he was running] for office, he deserved to be covered and treated like a candidate, but that\u2019s not what built and elevated Donald Trump,\u201d Petkanas said. \u201cIt was the coverage before he announced as a candidate.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-aclu-lawsuit_n_5c6341a2e4b03de942968362": "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two New Hampshire college students seeking to block a controversial new requirement for voters in the state, saying it imposes an unconstitutional \u201cpoll tax\u201d on voters and makes it disproportionately harder for students to cast a ballot.\n\nIn order to vote in New Hampshire, one needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there \u2015 meaning they have a continued physical presence in the state that they intend to maintain. Being \u201cdomiciled\u201d is legally different from being a \u201cresident.\u201d The state legally defines a resident as someone who intends to remain in the state \u201cfor the indefinite future.\u201d\n\nThe new measure, HB 1264, which is set to take effect on July 1, removes the phrase \u201cfor the indefinite future\u201d from the definition of resident and makes it identical to the definition of domiciled. Thus, anyone claiming to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in order to be eligible to vote is also saying they are a resident and is then obligated to required to get a driver\u2019s license and register their car within 60 days.\n\nThe ACLU says the change is unconstitutional because it imposes a needless and unnecessary burden on college students and others who don\u2019t plan to stay in the state permanently but want to vote there. The civil liberties group says the measure violates the First and 14th amendments because the state hasn\u2019t \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d the law to advance a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nThey also say it violates the 24th Amendment, which prohibits poll taxes, as well as the 26th Amendment, which grants the right to vote to anyone 18 or older.\n\nJulie Ebenstein, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project, noted New Hampshire lawmakers had been trying for decades to impose similar restrictions on college students\u2019 ability to vote. In 1972, a three-judge panel said a law that barred people who planned to leave a New Hampshire town at some point in the future from voting was unconstitutional. In 2014, a state court struck down a law that explicitly required anyone who registered to vote in New Hampshire to get a state driver\u2019s license and to get their vehicle registered there. That decision was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans passed HB 1264 shortly after Democrat Maggie Hassan defeated Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes for one of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seats in 2016. In the same year, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump in the state. Ebenstein noted the bill passed along party lines in the legislature and that lawmakers appeared to be targeting young voters and college students based on a perception that they supported Democrats.\n\n\u201cCollege students are perceived by legislators as being more liberal or being more left and we know that because the legislators said so. ... Given legislators\u2019 perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe 2016 election was very close in New Hampshire.\u201d She added that because of the state\u2019s small population the 13,000 undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire can make a difference in a close election.\n\nGiven legislators' perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted. Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney, ACLU Voting Rights Project\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, are Caroline Casey and Maggie Flaherty, two sophomores at Dartmouth College who are registered to vote in New Hampshire despite growing up outside the state. Both voted in the 2018 midterm elections there. Neither woman has a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and both intend to leave the state after graduating from college. Neither has a car and said in the complaint filed Wednesday that traveling to the nearest Division of Motor Vehicles would be a burden to them.\n\nIn a July op-ed justifying the law, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) wrote that people can vote in New Hampshire without satisfying the obligations of residents. The new law, he said, would put everyone on \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\nIn an advisory opinion last year, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found 3-2 that the new measure did not violate either the New Hampshire Constitution or the First or 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the law did not amount to a poll tax nor did it target young voters.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the State may legitimately establish procedures by which persons who may be tempted to insincerely claim domicile for voting purposes are discouraged from doing so by the prospect that such a claim can result in their incurring the full panoply of obligations imposed on all other state residents,\u201d the majority wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that states may not condition the right to vote on the payment of a tax or fee,\u201d they continued. \u201cHowever, the opponents of HB 1264 are mistaken when they claim that the bill conditions voting on the payment of motor vehicle fees or taxes. Rather, if a person becomes obligated to pay such fees or taxes, it will not be because the person votes, but because the person owns or drives a motor vehicle and is a resident of this state. Thus, a person who claims domicile in New Hampshire for voting purposes but who does not drive or own a motor vehicle will have no obligation to pay motor vehicle related fees.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images The ACLU is suing New Hampshire over a change in the legal definition of \"resident.\" The change is set to go into effect later this year.\n\nBut Ebenstein said the two students in the case had already shown they were legitimate New Hampshire voters. The state, she said, was essentially adding an additional hurdle for the students to prove they were bona fide residents.\n\n\u201cOur clients, who moved to New Hampshire, been active on campus, been active in their communities, who have already participated in the political process in New Hampshire are fully committed to their state and their role in the local community and certainly do to New Hampshire play a large role in the political conversation and process. That\u2019s most likely why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with ensuring someone\u2019s eligibility. It\u2019s just once they are eligible, the state can\u2019t put barriers in the way of letting them exercise that right,\u201d she added. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to prove their devotion to New Hampshire by paying fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sununu expressed confidence the law would be upheld:\n\nThis lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate attempt to dredge up arguments that our State Supreme Court already rejected last summer. The Supreme Court addressed each of the legal arguments made by opponents of House Bill 1264 and found that the law ensures that every voter is treated the same. I fully expect our federal court to reach the same conclusion. Given that House Bill 1264 does nothing more than align New Hampshire with virtually every other state in requiring residency in order to vote, the plaintiffs in this suit should be asked whether they plan to file identical lawsuits in every other state.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Sununu.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-poll-republicans-russian-interference_n_5c631e27e4b0b50014aa989d": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Nearly two years into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds that only a minority of Republican voters believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAnd even though a number of former Trump campaign officials have already pleaded guilty to crimes, a large chunk of Trump voters believes Mueller will eventually conclude that no one on Trump\u2019s team broke any laws.\n\nJust 27 percent of Republicans believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the poll found, with 54 percent saying Russia didn\u2019t play a role and the remainder unsure. By contrast, 80 percent of Democrats and half of the public overall say they believe Russia interfered in the election.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation has led to the indictments of 13 Russians accused of posing as Americans and using social media to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, as well as 12 Russian intelligence officers charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen documents.\n\nWhile members of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2015 George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and Michael Cohen \u2015 have already admitted criminal wrongdoing, 43 percent of Republicans think Mueller\u2019s investigation will conclude that nobody on the Trump campaign committed any crimes. An additional 38 percent expect the investigation to find that members of the Trump campaign, but not the president, commited crimes. Just 6 percent of Republicans expect Mueller to implicate the president.\n\nDemocrats have extremely high expectations the Mueller probe will reach the White House, with 60 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Clinton voters saying they believe Mueller will conclude that Trump himself committed crimes. (Federal prosecutors have already said that Trump \u2015 who they referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d \u2015 directed Cohen to make illegal payments to cover up alleged affairs that could have hurt his campaign.)\n\nOpinions on the Mueller investigation have changed relatively little over the past year, according to the survey, despite a number of new indictments and other developments. Americans are split 38 percent to 37 percent on whether they approve or disapprove of the FBI\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation; in February 2018, they were split 35 percent to 37 percent.\n\nAs in past polling, opinions remain largely ossified along partisan lines, and often even more sharply along electoral ones. Just 34 percent of Trump voters have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with nearly three-quarters believing the bureau is biased against the president. By contrast, 84 percent of Clinton voters express at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with about two-thirds expecting the agency to deal fairly with Trump. Both sets of numbers are little changed from the previous survey.\n\nThe remainder of the public, whose political views might be more malleable, are largely tuned out of the story. Just 26 percent of non-voters say they\u2019ve been following about Mueller\u2019s investigation even somewhat closely, and only 27 percent report having at least a fairly good understanding of what the investigation has uncovered. More than half say they\u2019re not sure whether they approve of Mueller\u2019s handling of his job as special counsel.\n\nAbout the same percentage of Trump and Clinton voters said they were following news about the Russia probe \u201cvery closely,\u201d but a larger number of Trump voters (36 percent) than Clinton voters (30 percent) claimed they understood what Mueller had uncovered \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\nThe survey indicated that 73 percent of Clinton voters thought the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia was a \u201cvery serious problem,\u201d while 63 percent of Trump voters thought it was \u201cnot a problem at all.\u201d Nine out of 10 Clinton voters believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election, while 50 percent of Trump voters say Russia did not interfere in the election.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions, and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Porter initially trailed her opponent, but the ballots counted after Nov. 6 skewed toward her.\n\nPorter benefited from the backlash to President Donald Trump among moderate suburban voters in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District \u2015 one of seven Republican-controlled California House seats where Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nShe ran as an unabashed proponent of Medicare for all, expanded Social Security and tough banking rules, but emphasized issues with broad appeal: the damaging effect of the Republicans\u2019 tax cuts and effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, tougher gun laws and women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cThe electoral tide almost always pulls against the president\u2019s party during his first midterm election, and this year\u2019s tide was especially strong because President Trump has been especially divisive,\u201d said Matthew Beckmann, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cPorter\u2019s campaign \u2015 focused on unifying Californians and checking President Trump \u2015 was pitch perfect for riding this national wave all the way from a Republican district in California to the seat of power in Washington.\u201d\n\nRELATED COVERAGE An Elizabeth Warren Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Is Defying The Odds In The Cradle Of California Conservatism\n\nPorter, a 44-year-old law professor at UC Irvine, defeated two-term Rep. Mimi Walters (R), 56, a former investment banker who served in House Republican leadership.\n\nWalters, who was registered to vote in another district as recently as June 2017, drew criticism from some constituents for her lack of accessibility and declined to make any joint appearances with Porter.\n\nAnd unlike some other Republicans in vulnerable seats, Walters stuck with Trump on his two major legislative initiatives \u2015 the failed bid to repeal the ACA, as well as the tax cut bill that became law.\n\nAlthough California\u2019s 45th is an affluent district, the tax law\u2019s near-elimination of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction made it a net tax hike for many of the district\u2019s upper-middle-class residents. Porter\u2019s support for reinstating the deduction earned her the backing of the influential California and National Realtors Associations, which spent heavily on her behalf.\n\nPorter also bucked the California Democratic Party by declaring her intention to vote for a ballot initiative repealing a modest gas tax levied by the Democratic-run state government to fund infrastructure improvements. She argued that Orange County residents had already been hit hard by the federal tax law and that infrastructure funds could be secured through other means.\n\nPorter typically eschews labels, but she told HuffPost that she plans to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Medicare for All Caucus. She is critical of some Democrats\u2019 support for legislation that rolled back oversight of many large banks, and said she hopes to serve on committees that allow her to apply her expertise in financial policy.\n\nPorter, who collaborated with Warren in studying the impact of health care costs on household bankruptcies, was one of just two candidates who Warren endorsed in the Democratic primaries. Warren, who cruised to re-election on Nov. 6, was also an early backer of former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray.

Nearly 200 scholars from colleges and universities across Texas took issue with listing states\u2019 rights as a cause of the Civil War.\n\nIn a Nov. 12 letter to the state\u2019s education board, the scholars said doing so \u201cresurrect[s] the \u2018Lost Cause\u2019 myth, a long-discredited version of history first promoted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to glorify the Confederate past and reinforce white supremacist policies such as the disenfranchisement of African Americans and Jim Crow segregation.\u201d\n\nRon Francis, a Dallas middle school teacher who testified before the education board this month, put it another way. \u201cThe lies they\u2019re telling are a little smaller than the lies they used to tell,\u201d he told The Texas Tribune.\n\nHistorians have also taken issue with the board\u2019s decision to keep the biblical figure Moses on a list of political thinkers \u201cwhose principles of laws and government institutions informed the American founding documents.\u201d The board rejected amendments \u201cto remove a reference to the \u2018heroism\u2019 of the defenders of the Alamo\u201d and \u201cto correct a standard that suggests separation of church and state is not a key constitutional principle,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe board bowed to public pressure to keep former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and author and activist Helen Keller in the curriculums.

On Dec. 10 the DNC rolled out strict rules barring favoritism in the 2020 presidential primaries.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee issued rules Monday aimed at shoring up trust in its impartiality in the upcoming 2020 presidential nominating contest.\n\nThe DNC plans to bar employees and officers from publicly endorsing any presidential candidates throughout what is expected to be a crowded intraparty competition for the job of taking on President Donald Trump.\n\nThe rules would prohibit DNC staffers and officers from financial contributions to particular candidates, attendance of events that could suggest partiality, public statements or social media posts espousing presidential preferences, internal communications expressing views for or against Democratic candidates, and even gestures like displaying bumper stickers or lawn signs for individual campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe new DNC is committed to making sure that our 2020 nominating process is fair and transparent,\u201d said its Chairman Tom Perez. \u201cThese new policies will help ensure that there is no perception of partiality by the DNC during the campaign for the Democratic nomination.\u201d\n\nDNC CEO Seema Nanda sent a memorandum to DNC staff laying out the new guidelines on Monday afternoon. Patrice Taylor, the DNC\u2019s director of party affairs and delegate selection, sent a similar set of instructions to DNC officers.\n\nThe rules aim to avoid a repeat of the 2016 presidential primaries, when supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were critical of the DNC for appearing to favor Hillary Clinton.\n\nThese critics seized on hacked internal DNC emails published by WikiLeaks showing DNC staff members musing about the possibility of using Sanders\u2019 Jewish faith against him in Appalachian primaries. The leak of the hacked emails in late July, days before the Democratic National Convention formally nominating Clinton, prompted then\u2013DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe ongoing controversy over what the DNC did or did not do to boost Clinton and undermine Sanders fueled dissension from the party\u2019s left flank that might have undermined Clinton\u2019s performance on Election Day.\n\nPerez defeated Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the preferred choice of Sanders die-hards, in a race for the DNC chairmanship in February 2017.\n\nPerez has since fought to dispel left-wing doubts about his commitment to reforming the presidential nominating contest.\n\nIn August he won plaudits from the Sanders wing for spearheading a successful effort to disempower the so-called superdelegates \u2015 presidential convention delegates not bound to vote for the candidate chosen in their state\u2019s primary or caucus.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/midterm-election-results-analysis-blue-wave_us_5bde7bd2e4b09d43e31f8e2a": "BRIGHTON, Mich. \u2015 Doug Vandewarker, a software consultant, said he usually votes Republican. But he was voting Democratic this time because he didn\u2019t think Donald Trump \u201cshould be the face of our country.\u201d\n\nOver the course of two hours outside a polling place in Brighton, a small Michigan city roughly equidistant between Detroit and Lansing, I heard many more statements similar to that \u2015 like when Mike Blood, managing director at a software company, said he wanted \u201ca bulwark against the current administration,\u201d and when Crystal Straughan, a hairdresser, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the president is a good example for my child.\u201d\n\nAll of these people said they\u2019d voted for Republicans at points in the past, as did Mary Ann Budd, a horticulturalist. But on Tuesday, she said, \u201cI voted Democratic all the way through and I haven\u2019t done that in years. I\u2019m independent, leaning conservative. There needs to be more balance.\u201d\n\nIt was a lot different from what I\u2019d heard two years ago outside another Michigan polling place \u2015 in Macomb County, the heavily white, middle-class Detroit suburb where the most energized voters were the ones who hated Hillary Clinton. The angry mood was a hint of things to come that night.\n\nI\u2019d picked Brighton for this year\u2019s stakeout in the hopes it would be similarly revealing. The city sits in Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which Trump carried by 7 percentage points and Mike Bishop, the Republican incumbent, won by even more in 2016. But this time Bishop was running against Democrat Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer who had served in Iraq. Her big issue was Bishop\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its highly popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe argument over health care \u2015 along with a devastating television ad \u2015 may have made the difference. Slotkin won, with the Wednesday morning tally showing her vote share at 50.8 percent to Bishop\u2019s 46.8 percent, for a margin of roughly 13,000 votes.\n\nSlotkin\u2019s victory was part of a bigger trend, one that was arguably Tuesday\u2019s most important result: Democrats winning back the House of Representatives. As of Wednesday morning, Democrats seemed poised to claim about 230 seats overall, giving them a 25-seat majority, give or take \u2015 more than enough to stop Republican legislation and, no less important, to start Democratic investigations.\n\nThe push to repeal Obamacare by legislation will stop, at least for now. The Trump administration\u2019s management of government, not to mention Trump\u2019s personal and financial conduct, will finally get some congressional scrutiny.\n\nDemocrats made other major gains \u2015 like the election of America\u2019s first openly gay governor in Colorado and the passage of ballot initiatives in three deeply conservative states that will allow 300,000 low-income working adults to get Medicaid. Two years ago, in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, shell-shocked Democrats probably would have cherished such victories.\n\nBut the mood among Democrats and their supporters was pretty mixed as Tuesday slipped into Wednesday.\n\nHow The System Is Still Rigged Against Democrats\n\nPartly the disappointment was a function of losses by a handful of candidates, like Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas congressman running for the Senate, in whom Democrats across the country had invested so much emotionally.\n\nPartly it was how the night played out: The first big news came from Florida, where progressives watched one of their heroes, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, lose his bid to become governor \u2015 even as they saw one of their villains, outgoing governor Rick Scott, move ahead in the vote for U.S. senator. (A recount is now likely in the Senate race.)\n\nBut the setbacks went beyond that.\n\nControl of the U.S. Senate had also been in play this election and, although the polls had suggested for a while that Republicans were likely to retain their majority, many Democrats grasped at encouraging signs \u2015 like shocking early turnout numbers in Texas or a late-breaking media investigation of the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. In the end, the polls were right and the upset didn\u2019t happen.\n\nRepublicans will actually emerge from the election with a larger majority in the Senate than they had before, ensuring no media narrative about a \u201cblue wave.\u201d But it would have been that kind of wave if votes actually translated more directly to results. Democrats won the national popular vote by more than 7 percentage points, according to the latest data.\n\nThis is the new normal in America, the political minority wielding power that looks more like a majority\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret why Democrats nevertheless emerged with fewer Senate seats. The Constitution gives disproportionate power to small states in the upper chamber, which in the current political alignment means conservative-leaning states have extra representation. This is an ongoing problem that will undermine Democrats in the next election just as surely as it did this one.\n\nA similar problem plagues the House, where the incoming Democratic majority is probably smaller than it might have been because of partisan gerrymandering. And the newly elected Democrats who won in Republican-leaning districts like Michigan\u2019s 8th are sure to face difficult challenges winning re-election in two years. As gerrymandering expert Dave Daley told HuffPost recently, \u201cIf it requires a generational wave to give Democrats [the House], that\u2019s a sign of just how powerful gerrymandering is, not a sign that it can be conquered.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Democrats will have to confront another familiar obstacle: the Electoral College, which also gives smaller states extra power. It\u2019s why Democrats have won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, with the lone loss a relatively small one, but in three of the six elections a Republican went to the White House anyway.\n\nThis is the new normal in America, the political minority wielding power that looks more like a majority\u2019s, and the problem seems likely to get worse as Republicans find more and more ways to protect themselves politically.\n\nSome of the most arresting images from Tuesday showed the long lines in Georgia, where Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state who was also the party\u2019s nominee for governor, told a private gathering that Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019 voter mobilization \u201ccontinues to concern us, especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote.\u201d (Kemp was ahead on Wednesday morning, though Georgia was still counting ballots.)\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Long lines at the polls in Georgia on Tuesday were a reminder that voting in many minority communities is difficult, which may have something to do with the Republican state officials in charge.\n\nThat kind of thing was happening all over in the country. In North Dakota, the location of another key contested Senate race, Republicans had implemented a voter identification law that made it more difficult for Native Americans, also thought to lean Democratic, to cast ballots.\n\nThose barriers to voting, like some of the more egregious attempts at partisan gerrymandering, are constitutionally suspect. But Democrats cannot count on federal courts to save them because Republicans are successfully packing the courts with sympathetic judges \u2015 including the U.S. Supreme Court, in no small part because they refused to fill a vacant seat while Barack Obama was still president.\n\nRepublicans have at least one other big advantage going for them and that is the media: They can depend on a slavishly partisan set of publications and networks upon which their followers will rely exclusively \u2015 an ecosystem that has no real analogue on the political left.\n\nIn 2018, that meant Republicans could make up stories about invasions from an immigrant caravan or claim falsely to support protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The strategy didn\u2019t work everywhere, as Mike Bishop can attest, but it probably helped secure at least some of those Senate races.\n\nWhat Democrats Can Do And What They Can\u2019t Do\n\nThe midterms were a stress test for the U.S. system of government \u2015 an experiment in whether a party could pursue a highly unpopular agenda and get away with it. The results were mixed at best. Republicans lost their House majority, yes, but they could have lost bigger, and somehow their Senate majority did grow.\n\nUltimately, some less-heralded victories at the state level may prove more consequential in terms of future elections. In Florida, voters approved a constitutional amendment to automatically re-enfranchise felons who had served their time, with exceptions for convicted murderers and sex offenders. That should give the vote to more than a million Floridians, many of whom committed only minor crimes many years before.\n\nAnd in Michigan, two key political reforms passed at the ballot box. One sets up a bipartisan commission to draw lines for state legislative and congressional districts, in the hopes of ending gerrymandering once and for all. The other enacts a series of reforms, including same-day registration, that will make it easier to vote.\n\nBoth reforms had strong support from the people I met in Brighton, even those who were voting for Republicans. Fairness seems to have at least some bipartisan appeal.\n\nBut the Michigan and Florida measures remain more the exception than the rule. Gerrymandering will persist in other parts of the country, as will voter suppression, and even moderate changes to the Senate (like adding the District of Columbia as a full-voting state) are not possible right now.\n\nAll of that means Democrats have to keep doing what they did over the past two years \u2015 nominating strong candidates, organizing supporters and turning out the vote. A lot of those Senate races were close and demographic trends at least should favor the party over time.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-email-morning-joe-supercut_us_5bf3f7b8e4b0376c9e68a5ad": "They aired a montage on Tuesday\u2019s show featuring some of the numerous times President Donald Trump bashed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign for using a private email server during her time as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cThis is the same Ivanka Trump who is related to Donald Trump?\u201d Scarborough sarcastically asked of the first daughter. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s the same family?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is expecting her father and his constitutionally challenged followers to start screaming for Ivanka to be locked up,\u201d Scarborough added. \u201cBut is it not too much to hold Ivanka Trump to the same standard of skepticism and standard of inquiry that we demanded in the press in over a year in the case of Hillary Clinton?\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-carter-grammys-spoken-word-album_us_5c60b896e4b0eec79b24c9cc": "Jimmy Carter has won a Grammy Award for his audiobook Faith: A Journey for All, marking the third Grammy win for the 39th president of the United States.\n\nCarter will claim the award for Best Spoken Word Album at Sunday\u2019s 2019 Grammy Awards.

Our cultural imagination is richer for his having lived, and so are Disney\u2019s shareholders. But this is only part of his story. Lee was also one of the masterminds of the Marvel Universe, the interlinked fictional world in which Marvel comics \u2014 and now Marvel movies and TV shows \u2014 unfold.\n\nAnd this made us wonder: Which of Lee\u2019s creations have had the largest impact? Not on our world but on his. Which characters\u2019 actions have been felt the most widely across the Marvel\u2019s multiverse, all the way from Earth-1 through Earth-616 (the main continuity in which the comics take place) to Earth-555326? Who sits at the center of the Marvel Universe?\n\nWe decided to figure it out.\n\nTo do so, we took the Marvel Database \u2014 think Wikipedia but for people who spent their adolescent Wednesday nights at Weasel\u2019s Comic Vault \u2014 and downloaded data on all 54,000 characters included there. It turns out that Lee is listed as having created or co-created 1,082 of them.\n\nBut how can we figure out who is important? To do this, we stole a trick from Google. The way Google decides the importance of a page is by looking at the number of other pages linking to it. Likewise, we counted the number of connections each character has to other characters. So, for example, if Peter Parker went on a trip to Titan with Tony Stark and it merited a mention on his character biography, that would count as a connection. From this we derived an impact score, i.e., the number of other character pages linking to a character, plus the number of links on that character\u2019s page linking to other characters.\n\nTo be clear, this was a text-based analysis and obviously relies on the precision of detail in the Marvel Database; some errors may have slipped through, despite the admirable rigor that has gone into the site\u2019s maintenance. Another potential limitation of the data is that characters are either tagged as a Lee co-creation or not \u2014 which explains some of the more unexpected appearances on the list, such as Jessica Jones, in whose creation Lee was only a relatively peripheral figure. The Tony Stark of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999) doesn\u2019t factor in our list because that iteration of the character wasn\u2019t created by Lee, at least not in the eyes of the Marvel wiki.\n\nWith those caveats out of the way, here is our list of the 100 most important Lee characters in the Marvel Universe, ranked in ascending order of importance.

Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) Tuesday night in the contest for New Jersey\u2019s 7th Congressional District, joining other Democrats who managed to win traditionally GOP-held seats in the Northeast.\n\nBy beating Lance, Malinoswki ended 37 years of Republican control of the district. Lance, a former state lawmaker, had been in office since 2009 and won re-election in 2016 by 11 percentage points.\n\nVoters in the district, a suburban-rural mix that hosts one of President Donald Trump\u2019s beloved golf courses in Bedminster, seemed to buy Malinowski\u2019s message that Trump needs an effective check and that a GOP figure would not provide one.\n\nLance had touted his bipartisan credentials and attempted to portray Malinowski as excessively liberal.\n\nBut concerns over GOP plans for health care \u2015 Lance flirted with but ultimately voted against the party\u2019s proposals to replace the Affordable Care Act \u2015 and the Republican tax bill\u2019s impact on New Jersey seemed to feature more in voters\u2019 thinking.\n\nMalinowski, who was born and spent his early life in communist Poland, is likely to be an influential figure on Capitol Hill. He\u2019s already well-known in Washington, having worked for over a decade as a lobbyist for the nonprofit group Human Rights Watch after serving at the State Department and the White House under President Bill Clinton. He played an especially big role in the congressional fight against torture, led by figures like the late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nPresident Barack Obama appointed Malinowski as his top human rights official in 2013. He used the perch to influence Obama\u2019s responses to situations like Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s vicious war on his own people and crackdowns by Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose connection with Trump Malinowski now frequently criticizes. He helped create pressure against Trump\u2019s initial effort to lift sanctions on Putin just before leaving government.\n\nIn 2014, Malinowski met with a domestic opposition group during a visit to the U.S.-aligned Middle Eastern monarchy of Bahrain. Though such meetings are fairly standard for U.S. diplomats, Bahrain reacted by declaring him persona non grata \u2015 and Malinowski led a vocal U.S. government response that represented a rare rebuke to one of many partner governments that say America should limit its talk about human rights for the sake of their stability.\n\nWith foreign policy high on Democrats\u2019 agenda for the next Congress, Malinowski is expected to feature in party debates about how to deal with Trump\u2019s support for authoritarian leaders abroad and the president\u2019s policy of deploying more U.S. troops abroad while insisting he \u2015 like much of the public \u2015 wants America\u2019s wars to end.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b": "Young people have helped lead all our great movements.

Ralph Northam (D) shows a person in blackface next to a person dressed as a member of the KKK. Northam initially apologized, indicating that he was pictured in the photo, then reversed course and denied he was in the picture.\n\nDemocrats lead the American public in condemning blackface, a new, national HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, putting the Democratic politicians who have admitted to wearing it perilously out of step with their party\u2019s evolving attitude toward racist behavior.\n\nAmericans as a whole say, 56 percent to 23 percent, that it\u2019s unacceptable for a white person to wear blackface makeup in order to appear as a black person for a costume. Democrats say it\u2019s unacceptable by a wider 78 percent to 12 percent. Republicans, by contrast, are close to evenly divided, with 36 percent calling blackface acceptable, 38 percent calling it unacceptable, and the rest unsure.\n\nOpinions are also divided starkly along racial lines. Black Americans say, 80 percent to 6 percent, that blackface is unacceptable, with 13 percent unsure; white Americans call blackface unacceptable by a smaller 50 percent to 27 percent margin, with 22 percent uncertain. Southern Democrats \u2015 many of whom are black \u2015 say by a 74-point margin that white people wearing blackface is unacceptable, while Democrats in the rest of the country say it\u2019s unacceptable by a 62-point margin.\n\nAnd there\u2019s an even sharper divide along the lines of the last presidential election. Hillary Clinton voters say by a 72-point margin that blackface is unacceptable. Donald Trump voters say, by a 10-point margin, that it\u2019s OK.\n\nThe poll was taken following the publication of a page from the medical school yearbook of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) that shows a person in blackface next to a person dressed as a member of the KKK. Northam initially apologized, indicating that he was pictured in the photo, then reversed course and denied he was in the picture. He later admitted he had worn blackface on a different occasion. Northam has so far ignored calls to resign. On Wednesday, after the survey was completed, the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, also admitted that he had worn blackface in college.\n\nA majority of those polled say they\u2019ve heard at least something about the controversy surrounding Northam.\n\nDemocrats are substantially likelier than Republicans to say the blackface photo should disqualify Northam from serving as governor. A 42 percent plurality of Democrats nationally call the photo disqualifying, with 27 percent saying it was relevant but not disqualifying, and 14 percent that it isn\u2019t relevant to his position as governor. By contrast, just 19 percent of Republicans called the photo disqualifying, with 26 percent saying it was relevant but not disqualifying, and 41 percent that it was irrelevant.\n\nNotably, however, the survey question did not identify which party Northam belongs to, a factor which may have both dampened his support among Democrats and boosted it among Republicans. Just 7 percent of Democrats thought that Northam had the support of most or all Democratic politicians, with 56 percent saying he had at most some party support and 37 percent unsure. Republicans were modestly more likely to think Northam had Democratic backing, but many were also unsure.\n\nPolling shows a significant, recent shift in attitudes in the Democratic Party about race and racist behavior. Between the years 2015 and 2018, the share of Democrats who said it was acceptable for whites to use the N-word dropped about 15 points. In the past decade, members of the party have also become increasingly likely to agree that \u201cblack people have gotten less than they deserve,\u201d and to cite racial discrimination as \u201cthe main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days.\u201d\n\nThe partisan gap in the public over issues of race has grown, even in recent years. In large part as a result of growing shares of Democrats taking more racially liberal views. Two examples here, on racial equality & discrimination.

A 2015 YouGov poll found relatively higher tolerance for blackface across partisan lines, but the question asked specifically about Halloween costumes.\n\nWhether these shifts will lead to tangible political consequences in Virginia still remains to be seen. Initial Morning Consult tracking numbers found Northam\u2019s approval numbers in the state dropping significantly in the immediate aftermath of the scandal, but still gave him net positive ratings among Democratic voters.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 4-5 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Fifty-six percent wanted the stronger candidate against Trump, even if they disagreed on most issues. Just 33 percent wanted a candidate whom they agreed with, even if that individual would struggle to defeat the president.\n\nThe finding is a shift from the electoral priorities expressed by both Democratic and Republican voters in 2016. But it matches what Democratic operatives across the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have been telling reporters for months.\n\n\u201cIn prior elections, voters from both parties consistently prioritized shared values over electability when selecting a nominee,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u201cIt looks like Democrats may be willing to flip that equation in 2020 because of their desire to defeat Trump. This is something to pay close attention to when primary voters really start tuning in to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: No consensus has developed among Democratic voters or party operatives over what type of candidate is best equipped to defeat Trump.\n\nShould it be a candidate who can win back the white working-class voters who defected to Trump in 2016? Then Democrats might want former Vice President Joe Biden, who is basing his potential candidacy around his appeal to that demographic. A candidate of color, like Texas\u2019 Juli\u00e1n Castro or California Sen. Kamala Harris, might be best equipped to win Republican-controlled Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona. Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have long argued that he would have won in 2016, and excitement around his policy platform could fire up working-class voters of all races.\n\nA report last month from Working America, an organizing group backed by the AFL-CIO, found \u201cwidespread anxiety and uncertainty about Democrats\u2019 prospects of defeating the president in 2020, and a lack of consensus on which candidate could best compete against Trump\u201d among working-class Democratic voters in Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe talk about electability was pervasive,\u201d Matt Morrison, Working America\u2019s executive director, told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThere was no clear consensus on what direction Democrats wanted to move in the presidential contest.\u201d\n\nContrast this focus on finding the most electable candidate with how people approached the 2016 election: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from shortly before the Iowa caucuses found just 16 percent of Democratic Party voters said choosing a candidate who could beat the GOP nominee was their top concern.\n\nElectability is already shaping early messaging on the 2020 primaries. For instance, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who both represent big cities on the East Coast, are playing up their rural roots, hoping to show Iowans they can win outside the most progressive parts of the country.\n\nThe consensus within both parties on who is electable and who isn\u2019t was torn apart by the results of the last presidential election, when Trump squeaked by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even as much of the GOP establishment predicted political doom. But while GOP primary voters seemingly responded to their party\u2019s presidential losses in 2008 and 2012 by throwing electability concerns out the window in 2016, Democratic primary voters in the 2018 midterms largely selected the same candidates that party bosses in Washington believed were most likely to win.\n\nThe Monmouth poll also found that 61 percent of Democratic women were willing to set aside their policy preferences to get a candidate capable of defeating the president, compared to just 45 percent of Democratic men.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grand-staircase-copper-mine-cancelled-trump-monument_us_5c54744ce4b00187b550761f": "Panoramic Images via Getty Images Sunrise over the Circle Cliffs near Long Canyon Overlook, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The Colt Mesa deposit, discovered in 1969, is located in the Circle Cliffs area, approximately 35 miles southeast of Boulder, Utah.\n\nA Canadian mining company has ditched its plans to extract copper, cobalt and other minerals from approximately 200 acres of land that the Trump administration carved out of the boundary protecting Utah\u2019s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\n\nGlacier Lake Resources Inc., a Vancouver-based copper and silver mining firm, announced in June that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the Colt Mesa deposit, as HuffPost first reported. The former mine site was part of the federally-protected site and off-limits to mining and other development until late last year when President Donald Trump dismantled a pair of national monuments in southern Utah.\n\nThe company\u2019s president and CEO, Saf Dhillon, told HuffPost in an email Thursday that Glacier Lake \u201cdropped that project a while back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do with anything at Colt Mesa,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe decided to not proceed forward.\u201d\n\nDhillon did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s question about when and why Glacier Lake decided to abandon the project.

Glacier Lake Resources Inc., a Vancouver-based mining firm, has scrapped plans to acquired mineral rights and begin extracting copper, cobalt and other minerals.\n\nLocated in the Circle Cliffs area, approximately 35 miles southeast of Boulder, Utah, the Colt Mesa deposit was discovered in 1968. Along with copper, it contains cobalt, zinc and nickel. A mine opened at the site in 1971 and operated on and off until 1974, when it was shut down due to a lack of water, according to a 1975 geological report by master\u2019s student Gay Madsen Collings at the University of Utah, which was cited by the company.\n\nThe land where the mine is located was previously owned by the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, or SITLA, and transferred to the Bureau of Land Management in the late 1990s, after the monument\u2019s designation.\n\nGlacier Lake\u2019s announcement last year troubled environmentalists who voiced concerns that a future mining operation would negatively impact tourism in the area. Dhillon told HuffPost at the time that the company was still in the \u201cvery early stage\u201d of assessing the property and that \u201cthe target is a high value, underground scenario with modest disturbance.\u201d\n\nRecords available on the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s website show that Utah residents Dan and Nicholas Proctor staked 10 claims \u2015 each just over 20 acres \u2015 at the site on March 29. The Proctors filed additional maintenance waivers and notices in September and December. Glacier Lake had agreed to pay the vendors $120,000 over a two-year period, plus a million common shares of its stock, which at the time was valued at around $45,000. The shares are currently valued at around $15,000.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton established the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996. In December, Trump cut the 1.87 million-acre site, the largest land national monument in the country, roughly in half. The administration also shrunk the nearby 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent. The moves opened the door for oil, gas and mineral extraction.\n\nFormer Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned at the beginning of last month, maintained that the rollbacks were not about energy or mineral extraction, but reporting by The Washington Post, The New York Times and other outlets has shown otherwise.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-power-grab-democrats-reaction_us_5c52aabee4b0ca92c6dd453b": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) set social media alight on Wednesday after he described legislation to make Election Day a paid holiday for federal workers as a \u201cpower grab\u201d by Democrats.\n\nMcConnell poured cold water on House Democrats\u2019 proposed H.R. 1 (known as the For The People Act) which contains a slew of reforms, including the Election Day proposal, which was aimed at making it easier for all Americans to be able to vote.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi and her colleagues are advertising it as a package of urgent measures to save American democracy,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cWhat it really seems to be is a package of urgent measures to rewrite the rules of American politics for the exclusive benefit of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s comments attracted widespread scorn on Twitter from politicians past and present, including Sen.

She and lesbian author and fellow TERF Julia Long barged into a meeting where Sarah McBride, a trans woman and the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, was meeting with a colleague after a conference on the hill.\n\nParker and Long went on a transphobic rant for nearly two minutes, consistently mis-gendering McBride and accusing her of perpetuating violence against women.\n\n\u201cWhy are you championing the rights of men to access women in women\u2019s prisons? And rape and sexually assault them as recently happened in the United Kingdom?\u201d Long asked, referring to the false notion that all trans women sexually assault cisgender women in prisons.\n\nParker interjected at one point, asking McBride: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you care about lesbian girls at 14 having double mastectomies? Why don\u2019t you care about that, Sarah?\u201d\n\nTERFs are an infamous and problematic group of feminists who do not believe that transgender women are women. The group consistently rejects trans women in feminist spaces and organizations, and believes they are protecting cis women in their fight.\n\nThroughout the entire two-minute clip, McBride does not respond to Long\u2019s and Parker\u2019s hateful rhetoric and taunting.\n\nParker and Long pressed McBride on the Equality Act, a bill introduced in 1974 as an amendment to the Civil Rights Act. The amendment would add integral protections for LGBTQ people including employment, housing, education and federally funded programs, among other things. Although the bill has received widespread support in Congress, it has yet to be passed into law.\n\nThe 2004 Gender Recognition Act, a British amendment similar to the U.S.\u2032 Equality Act, was the first piece of legislation to recognize transgender people by allowing queer and non-binary people to have their preferred gender pronoun properly reflected on government documents and identification. The legislation, however, imposes harsh rules and medically intrusive guidelines that need to be met before a person can legally change their gender.\n\nMany British TERFs, like Parker and Long, believe that the Gender Recognition Act would put cis women in danger by allowing men to change their identities and inflict more violence on women.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Parker\u2019s Facebook video had been viewed more than 11,000 times and the overwhelming amount of commenters were in support of Parker\u2019s and Long\u2019s actions.\n\nMcBride tweeted about the incident on Wednesday afternoon, sharing an article from Gay Star News who first reported the harassment.\n\n\u201cThis happened to me earlier today,\u201d McBride tweeted. \u201cWe had just concluded a really powerful meeting with parents of transgender youth and members of Congress and I won\u2019t let this incident diminish the love, pride and solidarity that filled that room just moments before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sad truth is that this kind of harassment is the reality for far too many transgender people, particularly trans women of color, across the country and around the world,\u201d she added.\n\nThe sad truth is that this kind of harassment is the reality for far too many transgender people, particularly trans women of color, across the country and around the world. \u2014 Sarah McBride (@SarahEMcBride) January 30, 2019\n\nThroughout the incident, I thought about the trans youth who have to experience their hostility and bullying day-in and day-out in the United Kingdom. \u2014 Sarah McBride (@SarahEMcBride) January 30, 2019\n\nToday I stand in solidarity with all those who face harassment for merely seeking their rights: women, both trans and cis, workers, immigrants, LGBTQ people, people with disabilities, and Black, Latinx, Asian and indigenous people. \u2014 Sarah McBride (@SarahEMcBride) January 30, 2019\n\nOlivia Dalton, the Human Rights Campaign senior vice president for communications and marketing, described the incident as \u201cdisturbing\u201d in a Thursday morning statement to HuffPost.\n\n\u201cIt is disturbing but not at all surprising that anti-transgender extremists brought to the United States at the behest of the Heritage Foundation would stoop to harassing a transgender woman and parents of transgender youth,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, an American conservative think tank, held a conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this week to discuss the \u201cleft\u2019s embrace of the transgender agenda,\u201d Gay Star News reports. It is unclear if Parker and Long were in Washington, D.C., to attend the conference.\n\n\u201cThat the targeted harassment occurred following a moving meeting between parents of trans kids and members of Congress reinforces the massive gap between our message of love and their agenda of bigotry,\u201d Dalton continued. \u201cNo one advocating for their basic human rights should face such hate and hostility, and shame on the Heritage Foundation for fostering this kind of atmosphere.\u201d\n\nDozens of people on Twitter, along with organizations like GLAAD and trans activist and actress Laverne Cox, sent messages of love and support to McBride after hearing of the transphobic incident.\n\n\u201cSo sorry this happened to you.

The shift appears to cut across party lines, although it\u2019s most pronounced among the president\u2019s opponents: The share who believe crime is a very serious national problem is down 9 percentage points among Republicans, 6 points among independents and 19 points among Democrats.\n\nFifty-three percent of the public currently believes that the level of crime has increased nationally over the past decade, with only 14 percent believing the level had decreased. That\u2019s at odds with the data on crime rates, which have for the most part declined over the past quarter-century.\n\nAmericans\u2019 views of the nation as a dangerous place are also at odds with their perceptions about the places where they live. Just 12 percent of Americans now say crime poses a very serious problem in their own communities, almost unchanged from the previous survey. And though 3 in 10 say they\u2019ve seen an increase in crime locally over the past decade, the majority say the level has stayed the same or fallen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has long made the promise to combat crime a central part of his platform. During the 2016 campaign, he declared himself the \u201claw-and-order candidate.\u201d In his inauguration speech, he cited the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d of \u201ccrime and gangs and drugs.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump used the threat of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in his thus-far unsuccessful push for a border wall, tweeting a couplet that read \u201cBUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!\u201d (As The Washington Post\u2019s Christopher Ingraham noted last year, the \u201csocial-science research on immigration and crime is clear: Undocumented immigrants are considerably less likely to commit crime than native-born citizens, with immigrants legally in the United States even less likely to do so.\u201d)\n\nThose who voted for Trump in 2016 are about twice as likely to say crime is a very serious problem in the U.S. (55 percent) than are Hillary Clinton voters (27 percent). Trump voters are also about twice as likely as Clinton voters to believe that crime has been on the rise both locally and nationally over the past decade. The distinction is softened closer to home, with just 18 percent of Trump voters and 10 percent of Clinton voters saying crime is a very serious problem in their own community.\n\nDivides in opinions about even national crime are relatively modest along other demographic lines. White Americans, for instance, are, by 7 points, likelier than black Americans to see crime as a very serious problem nationally but marginally less likely to say the same about their communities. Americans who live in rural areas are 9 points likelier than city-dwellers to call crime a very serious problem in the U.S. but are 5 points less likely to say crime is a very serious problem where they live.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 23-24 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

But as the claims unravel in the face of tough scrutiny, the damage they caused may be impossible to undo. That may be exactly the point.\n\n\n\nTexas Secretary of State David Whitley and Attorney General Ken Paxton, both Republicans, told county election officials last week that they suspected there were 95,000 noncitizens on their voting rolls, 58,000 of whom appeared to have voted in one or more elections since 1996. But that claim, which was amplified by President Donald Trump, is quickly falling apart.\n\nOn Tuesday, Whitley\u2019s office conceded that at least 20,000 of the registered voters flagged as potential noncitizens actually had had their citizenship verified. And there may be more. Paxton, who blasted out a news release with Whitley\u2019s findings suggesting there was fraud, has not said anything since the numbers have come under scrutiny.\n\n\n\nCounty election officials are investigating the names further and suspect there may be more eligible voters, including naturalized citizens, on the list.\n\n\n\nBut even as it becomes clear that Paxton and Whitley exaggerated the extent of voter fraud, it may not matter.\n\nVOTER FRAUD ALERT: The @TXsecofstate discovered approx 95,000 individuals identified by DPS as non-U.S. citizens have a matching voter registration record in TX, approx 58,000 of whom have voted in TX elections. Any illegal vote deprives Americans of their voice. \u2014 Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) January 25, 2019\n\nTo many, the debacle in Texas is a just the latest chapter in a story that has played out over and over again in several states across the country in recent years. An official or activist group will make a salacious claim of illegal voting using unverified information and grab headlines before the claim is investigated and debunked in the ensuing months. Almost always, the claim turns out to be either wildly exaggerated or untrue, but it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2015 people remember only the original, scintillating accusation. While several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem, politicians use the simmering uncertainty about election integrity to justify new voting restrictions.\n\nIn Texas, the investigation of suspected noncitizens comes after a surge in Latino voter turnout in November and a pending bill in the Texas Legislature to require proof of citizenship when someone registers to vote.\n\nLorraine Minnite, a Rutgers professor who has studied many allegations of voter fraud, said what\u2019s happening in Texas was part of a \u201cvery familiar pattern\u201d that she\u2019s observed over two decades.\n\n\u201cIt almost doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re not correct, because they just keep saying it,\u201d said Minnite, the author of The Myth of Voter Fraud. \u201cThe political strategy is almost to deliberately produce bad information, and then you go out with it and it\u2019s hard to debunk right away.\u201d By the time that happens, the misinformation is etched into voters\u2019 psyches.\n\n58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2019\n\nDebunking a claim of voter fraud is a complicated process that may involve going through volumes of voter registration files, assessing methodology, reviewing voter registration forms and contacting voters. It can take months. In Texas, many local election officials say they are going to proceed very slowly and cautiously with checking the list Whitley\u2019s office provided.\n\nThe complexity of verifying a voter fraud claim, combined with how long it takes, adds to the likelihood that people will stop paying attention.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this lag between the time when the allegations are made and when the actual investigations are completed. It\u2019s in that lag period that the perceptions solidify to ... \u2018Yes, this a problem, and we need to do something about it,\u2019\u201d said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who has analyzed many allegations of election fraud. \u201cBy the time we actually get to the follow-up story, if there is one... by then it\u2019s too late. People don\u2019t connect the stories. They just believe whatever the initial story was.\u201d\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in 2016, in which the popular vote went to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but he has offered no evidence to support that claim. Despite an avalanche of stories showing that\u2019s not true, a HuffPost poll last year showed 28 percent of Americans, and nearly half of Republicans, believe millions voted illegally in 2016. Thirty-five percent said they were unsure. Republicans in Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina have pushed voting restrictions, citing the need to improve election integrity.\n\nNicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard, said it was easy for people to latch on to voter fraud claims.\n\n\u201cMainstream media coverage of false claims ends up validating and amplifying, even if you say this is false.... You make it familiar and people think familiar things are true,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe brain likes rumors. Broadly speaking, the crazier the rumor, the stickier it is for the brain. And correcting rumors doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d\n\nWhen figures of authority, such as Trump, amplify false claims, they become even harder to debunk, Minnite added.\n\nMcDonald said news organizations faced a kind of Catch-22 in covering allegations of voter fraud. Writing about them, even if an article included evidence to the contrary, only amplified unsubstantiated allegations. On the other hand, he said, ignoring the claims entirely allowed them to go into the public sphere unchallenged.\n\nMcDonald said it was encouraging that news outlets like The Texas Tribune covered the latest allegations of fraud with skepticism from the outset. There hasn\u2019t always been that kind of suspicion from news coverage in the past, and McDonald said the immediate skepticism helps start an important public dialogue about the veracity of the initial claim.\n\nOn Tuesday, as Texas officials were contacting county election administrators to correct the list of suspected noncitizens, a woman across the country stood and spoke in favor of a proposed voter ID bill in the Wyoming Legislature. She pointed to the allegations of fraud in Texas \u2015 which already requires voters to present ID at the polls \u2015 to explain why her state needed voter ID. The bill advanced.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shutdown-state-of-the-union_us_5c5a4711e4b00187b55612d4": "The longest government shutdown in history happened on Donald Trump\u2019s watch. But the president made no mention of it in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.\n\nThe partial government shutdown lasted 35 days, affecting about 800,000 federal workers \u2015 in addition to thousands of federal contractors. Government employees missed two paychecks, with many wondering how they would pay for essentials like food, medicine and housing. They looked for new jobs, turned to relatives and friends for temporary loans and went to food pantries.\n\nThe shutdown occurred because Trump insisted that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the country\u2019s southern border, even though he once promised that Mexico would pay for that barrier. Democrats refused to go along with his demand and said he should simply fund the government and argue about immigration later. He refused.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump caved and signed a bill funding the government for three weeks. He has insisted that if he doesn\u2019t get his money for a wall by Feb. 15, he may declare a national emergency allowing him to build it anyway.\n\nTrump never mentioned what federal workers went through during his speech Tuesday night. He expressed no remorse for the shutdown, and he didn\u2019t promise that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. The closest he came to referencing the shutdown was in urging Congress to fund the border wall when passing legislation to fund the government beyond Feb. 15.\n\n\u201cCongress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland and secure our southern border,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers and human traffickers out of business.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s State of the Union address was affected by the shutdown. It was supposed to occur on Jan. 29, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) canceled it \u2015 she has that power since the president delivers it in the Capitol \u2015 and said they would discuss a new date only after the government reopened.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach is a break from what President Bill Clinton did in 1996, after what had previously been the longest shutdown ever. In his State of the Union speech that year, Clinton honored a heroic public servant who had been furloughed because of the shutdown. He then warned Congress to remember the pain of the shutdown when legislating in the future.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s address Tuesday night, Stacey Abrams \u2015 who ran for governor of Georgia \u2015 did address the shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/madonna-glaad-advocate-for-change-award_us_5c598c34e4b0871047577f4e": "Through her music and performances, Madonna has been making LGBTQ causes a massive part of her artistic platform for more than 35 years \u2015 and now, the community is set to recognize that contribution in a very big way.\n\nThe Queen of Pop will be presented with the Advocate for Change Award at the 2019 GLAAD Media Awards in New York on May 4.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) in the race for the party's 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nGillibrand has largely borne alone the brunt of the criticism over the forced departure of Franken, who was popular among the Democratic base for his often biting criticisms of President Donald Trump.\n\nGillibrand\u2019s detractors saw her an \u201copportunist\u201d who was positioning herself for a 2020 presidential run. Her party colleagues \u2015 including other 202 presidential contenders \u2015 have not faced the same blame over their stance on Franken.\n\nSo far, the Franken issue doesn\u2019t seem to be significantly hurting Gillibrand among Democratic activists (except, perhaps, in Minnesota) and voters, as much as it is with a certain class of donors. Indeed, the first endorsement Gillibrand received in Iowa for her presidential bid came from the chair of the state party\u2019s Stonewall Caucus, which focuses on LGBTQ advocacy. The chair specifically cited the senator\u2019s stance on Franken as a reason to back her.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign declined to comment on Buell\u2019s criticisms and whether Gillibrand has been unfairly singled out on the Franken issue.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-have-found-their-future-and-it-looks-like-stacey-abrams_us_5c5a0395e4b0871047587092": "The Democratic Party\u2019s picks to give responses to President Donald Trump\u2019s first two addresses to Congress reflected the state of uncertainty the party found itself in. After giving the 2017 slot to then-72-year-old former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear \u2014 a backward-looking pick if there ever was one \u2014 they followed up with the selection of Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, best known for being the scion of the quintessential Democratic family.\n\nLawrence Bryant / Reuters Many Democrats want campaigns in the future to strike a balance between turning out the party's base and reaching out to the middle, as Stacey Abrams' campaign did.\n\nBoth speeches had their merits \u2014 Beshear\u2019s, in particular, previewed the party\u2019s relentless focus on health care during the midterm elections \u2014 but are mostly now remembered for the awkwardly lit diner where Beshear delivered his speech and for how wet Kennedy\u2019s lips appeared.\n\nFormer Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019 speech this year may also end up being remembered for something other than its content, if it\u2019s remembered at all. (It has been years since the State of the Union \u2014 or the opposition party\u2019s response \u2014 had an actual, measurable impact on American politics.) But Democratic leaders\u2019 decision to have Abrams deliver the response shows the party isn\u2019t quite as lost as it was in the months following Trump\u2019s surprising victory over Hillary Clinton. The party, or at least its top operatives, now knows in what direction it wants to head, and it\u2019s toward more candidates like Abrams.\n\nMany Democrats now view Abrams\u2019 campaign, which came up just short against Brian Kemp, a Trump acolyte, as a model for future candidates. The party, which spent much of 2017 and 2018 caught in a debate about whether it should focus on mobilizing young people and voters of color or winning over suburban voters who are disenchanted with Trump, views Abrams as proof it doesn\u2019t need to be a choice.\n\nAbrams, as a black woman who spent years courting donors to fund voter registration projects targeting people of color through her New Georgia Project, is often given the shorthand label of a progressive. But her 2018 campaign showed just as much dedication to reaching out to the middle as it did to firing up her party\u2019s base.\n\nAs early as her primary against Stacey Evans, Abrams positioned herself as a candidate who could appeal across Georgia\u2019s racial and urban-suburban-rural divides. In a 30-second ad titled \u201cGuys Like Me,\u201d a white union worker, speaking with a slight drawl, delivers his pitch for Abrams.\n\n\u201cShe understands all of Georgia,\u201d says Kenny Mullins, an official with a local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers chapter. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting against tax hikes that are going to hurt guys like me that get up at the crack of dawn to go and work long hours.\u201d\n\nThroughout the campaign, she continued reaching out to business groups and Republicans. In another spot, released in October, the Georgia Democratic Party noted she worked with the GOP and fought to stop \u201ca massive tax hike on Georgians.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can continue the progress we\u2019ve made by building each other up, not tearing each other down,\u201d Abrams says in the ad.\n\nAnd none of her outreach to the center took away from her work to register and turn out minority and young voters who were more likely to support Democrats. At the same time, she largely avoided embracing left-wing policy priorities like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cHer message was very open to everyone,\u201d said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who chaired the Democratic Governors Association during Abrams\u2019 run and funneled about $4.5 million to support her. \u201cIt was about economic opportunity. It wasn\u2019t exotic or avant-garde.\u201d\n\nThe result was sky-high turnout and a narrow loss in a state where Democrats had become accustomed to even highly sought-after recruits losing by substantial margins. (And Abrams\u2019 result must be considered in light of Kemp\u2019s influence as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state on the election process. She has said that the election was \u201cnot free and fair\u201d and that he enabled \u201cthe systemic dismantling of our democracy.\u201d)\n\nHer message went furthest in the state\u2019s suburbs: According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she won Cobb County, a populous suburb of Atlanta where former House Speaker Newt Gingrich began his political career, with 54 percent of the vote, four years after GOP then-Gov. Nathan Deal won it with 56 percent. In Gwinnett County, she garnered 57 percent of the vote, a massive spike from the 42 percent Democratic nominee Jason Carter got in the 2014 governor\u2019s contest.\n\nHer message was very open to everyone. It was about economic opportunity. It wasn\u2019t exotic or avant-garde. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, former chairman, Democratic Governors Association\n\nAbrams\u2019 bipartisan tendencies, which date back to her time in the state legislature, have long generated suspicion among some progressives, even as journalists have often painted her as part of the party\u2019s left wing. But Abrams surpassed expectations in a way that Democratic candidates who ran more left-leaning campaigns \u2014 like Florida\u2019s Andrew Gillum, Arizona\u2019s David Garcia and Maryland\u2019s Ben Jealous \u2014 weren\u2019t able to.\n\nOf course, her strategy isn\u2019t easily replicated. Jealous and Garcia were hammered by millions of dollars in attack ads from the Republican Governors Association, leaving them with little chance of success. But Abrams, a favorite of both the Democratic small-dollar donor base and the party\u2019s megadonors, had more than enough cash to invest in getting her message out, parrying GOP attacks and getting out her core voters.\n\nAbrams wasn\u2019t alone in this type of success. Other Democrats have pointed to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a more conservative Democrat, who used a similar strategy of investing big dollars in field and digital operations to turn out younger and more progressive voters while using television ads to reach across the aisle with messages focused on helping veterans and protecting Obamacare.\n\nAnd now New York Sen. Chuck Schumer hopes he can persuade Abrams to join Sinema in Congress\u2019 upper chamber. Schumer and Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto have met with Abrams, hoping to get her to challenge GOP Sen. David Perdue, a Trump favorite and former CEO who is running for a second term in 2020.\n\nThe ambitious Abrams, who famously used an Excel spreadsheet to plan out her life \u2015 including a 2028 presidential run \u2015 has always wanted to be governor of Georgia but isn\u2019t ruling out a Senate bid. Her team is in nearly constant contact with EMILY\u2019s List, which heavily backed her 2018 run. She has launched Fair Fight Georgia, a group that she said will \u201cwill pursue accountability in Georgia\u2019s elections and integrity in the process of maintaining our voting rolls.\u201d The group has already filed a major lawsuit against the state and aired a Super Bowl ad focused on voter rights.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are acting as if she\u2019s already a candidate. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has sent out press releases calling Fair Fight a \u201cpolitical slush fund.\u201d And the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a video attacking her before her State of the Union response.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-monument-rollback-utah-lawmaker-report_us_5c539dbbe4b01d3c1f11f2d1": "The Interior Department\u2019s internal watchdog issued a report Thursday concluding there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke gave retired Utah state Rep. Mike Noel preferential treatment when he redrew the boundary of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\n\nThe months-long investigation by the agency\u2019s Office of Inspector General came at the request of Montana-based environmental group Western Values Project. Investigators looked into whether Noel influenced the Trump administration\u2019s decision to dismantle the protected site.\n\nLate last year, on Zinke\u2019s recommendation, Trump cut the 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante, the largest land national monument in the country, roughly in half. The rollback opened the door for oil and gas exploration and for other development.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump signs the hat of Bruce Adams, chairman of the San Juan County Commission, after signing a proclamation to shrink the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City.\n\nNoel, a vocal opponent of the monument established during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, advocated for shrinking the site and applauded President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to do so and then tried to rename a Utah highway after the president as a thank you. He also owns a 40-acre parcel that was ultimately stripped of monument protections. Western Values Project argued that Noel\u2019s failure to disclose his land ownership while pushing for a rollback of the monument was a conflict of interest, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n\nIn their seven-page report, investigators said they interviewed Zinke, Noel and several Interior Department officials directly involved in the administration\u2019s review of Grand Staircase-Escalante. A summary of the findings was obtained by The Associated Press in November.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence that Noel influenced the [Department of Interior\u2019s] proposed revisions to the [monument\u2019s] boundaries, that Zinke or any other DOI employee involved in the project were aware of Noel\u2019s financial interest in the revised boundaries, or that anyone at the DOI gave Noel preferential treatment when proposing the boundary modifications,\u201d the report states.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former Utah state Rep. Mike Noel, a Republican, owned land within the original monument boundaries.\n\nZinke told investigators he was unaware that Noel owned property inside the original boundary and did not direct agency staff to remove any private property, including Noel\u2019s, from the monument, according to the report. Likewise, Noel told investigators he did not ask Zinke or any other agency official to carve out his property. Interior staff had \u201cvarying degrees of knowledge\u201d about Noel\u2019s property ownership but said they were not pressured to cut it from the monument, the report states.\n\nIn an interview Thursday with the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, Noel said that he \u201cnever had any doubt I would be exonerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI answered everything truthfully,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI have never, ever brought up to the Department of Interior or the Bureau of Land Management my personal property holdings.\u201d\n\nNoel retired last year after 16 years in the Utah Legislature and is currently the executive director of the Kane County Water Conservancy District. Zinke resigned in early January under a cloud of ethics scandals.\n\nOIG\u2019s probe also concludes that the Department of the Interior \u201chad no formal processes in place for modifying national monument boundaries\u201d but that agency staff \u201cdeveloped a process and followed it when reviewing\u201d Grand Staircase-Escalante and other sites subject to Zinke\u2019s review. The president also slashed Utah\u2019s 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent.\n\nChris Saeger, executive director of Western Values Project, said Thursday that the report is \u201cincomplete\u201d and \u201chighlights the haphazard process this administration used to slash protections for some of our most treasured public lands.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsence of evidence is not evidence of absence,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe investigation did not look into the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s short-lived plan to dispose of more than 1,600 acres of land previously part of Grand Staircase-Escalante. First reported by HuffPost, the agency\u2019s recommendation \u2015 buried in a draft resource management plan for the area \u2015 called for the selling or transferring of 16 federal parcels, including 120 acres in between properties owned by Noel.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gop-face_us_5c425823e4b0a8dbe171600b": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Three years after a hostile takeover and two years into the resulting presidency, Republican leaders and activists have yet to confront a looming existential question: What is the future of their party the day Donald Trump is gone?\n\nBecause while the Trump presidency is creating consequences for the nation and the world that could take years to undo, the one institution that will be the most dramatically altered is the 165-year-old political party that put him into the White House.\n\nAnd whether Trump\u2019s last day in office is just one month away following a sudden resignation or six years off following a second term, Trump\u2019s chaotic, fact-free personality cult thus far has no obvious heir apparent. At the same time, the president\u2019s daily dishonesties, repeated insults of large segments of the electorate and likely collusion with a foreign power to win his election may have poisoned his adopted party\u2019s brand for many elections to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a demographic death spiral,\u201d said Republican consultant John Weaver, a top aide to former Ohio GOP Gov. John Kasich. \u201cIf we were Coca-Cola or Delta or any product on the market, would you be happy that your customers, your base of support, were old, white and closed-minded?\u201d\n\nTrump had little to do with the Republican Party before entering its presidential primary nearly four years ago. He was not a major donor. He had never run for so much as a local committeeman post. He was never a campaign surrogate or ever considered for a presidential appointment in previous administrations.\n\nNevertheless, with a combination of blatantly race-based appeals to a key segment of the GOP base and boasts that his business \u201csavvy\u201d would bring back long-disappeared manufacturing jobs, Trump managed to beat out more than a dozen rivals to grab the nomination.\n\n\u201cHe hijacked our party, and people went along with it,\u201d said Weaver, who had previously worked for Arizona Sen. John McCain. \u201cAnd we have try to fix it for the sake of the country.\u201d\n\nThat, though, may be easier said than done. Most of the changes Trump has imposed on the country have been through executive actions and by altering internal policies at the various executive agencies. As such, they can be undone just as easily by the next president. Similarly, tariffs that have been unilaterally imposed can be unilaterally lifted, and overseas allies that have been rattled by Trump may be soothed by his successor, albeit over a period of years.\n\nChanges to what has now been Trump\u2019s party for three years may be far stickier.\n\nTrump hand-picked a Republican National Committee chair so loyal to him personally that she even stopped using her full name at his suggestion. Committee members who had opposed Trump, meanwhile, tended to either rehabilitate their views or not run for re-election. The RNC now routinely backs Trump\u2019s falsehoods and fear-mongering about immigrants, while Trump\u2019s success has spawned a cohort of mimics, running their campaigns featuring anti-minority, anti-fact themes.\n\nShawn Steel, a prominent RNC member from California, said Trump\u2019s style and tactics were proven correct on Nov. 8, 2016. \u201cHe\u2019s different. He\u2019s done something that our nice guy moderate Republicans couldn\u2019t do. He won.\u201d\n\nFrom Dog Whistle To Bullhorn\n\nTrump certainly was not the first Republican nominee to harness racial animus and xenophobia to win the White House.\n\nThat distinction goes to Richard Nixon, who in 1968 targeted white voters, primarily in the South, who remained angry at the Democratic Party because of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act.\n\nUsing coded themes about \u201claw and order,\u201d Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d let him break into a region that had voted almost exclusively for Democratic presidential nominees since the end of Reconstruction. His resulting victory began the decades-long process that turned the South into a Republican stronghold and flipped the parties\u2019 traditional positions on race. Democrats had for the first half of the century supported segregation while Republicans had generally supported more rights for former slaves and their descendants. Starting in Nixon\u2019s presidency, more and more segregationist Democrats switched to become Republicans, with the remaining Democrats far more in line with the more liberal national party.\n\nRepublican nominees after Nixon continued relying on this racially divisive approach for decades. From Ronald Reagan\u2019s apocryphal Cadillac-driving welfare queen to George H.W. Bush\u2019s Willie Horton television ad to son George W. Bush\u2019s defense of the Confederate flag, appeals to disproportionately Southern, disproportionately rural white voters was an important part of their campaigns.\n\nWhat made Trump\u2019s approach different was his willingness to replace the previous candidates\u2019 dog whistles with a bullhorn.\n\nOn the day of his announcement speech, Trump called Mexicans who crossed the southern border rapists and drug smugglers and then insulted the Mexican government by claiming he would build a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall and force that country to pay for it.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Donald Trump makes his entrance into the 2016 presidential race \u2014 and effectively into the GOP \u2014 at a June 16, 2015, event in which he described Mexicans crossing the border as \"rapists.\"\n\nSubsequently, he insulted a federal judge of Mexican heritage, attacked the Muslim parents of an Army officer who died protecting his troops and promised to stop Muslims from even entering the country.\n\n\u201cTrumpism appeals almost exclusively to those folks \u2015 overtly racist scumbags,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and outspoken Trump critic since the start of the GOP primary in 2015. He estimated that Republicans motivated mainly by race make up about 12 percent of the primary voting base. \u201cThey\u2019re a small faction, but a loud faction. \u2026 The rest of the party is along for the ride. They\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nAt the very first GOP primary debate, in August 2015, when Trump insulted his rivals onstage, the RNC members and their invited guests in the Cleveland audience booed loudly.\n\nBut out in the land of voters, the primary electorate ate it up. Even at the \u201cRed State\u201d gathering of Christian conservatives in Atlanta, Trump was hands down the most popular character on the giant screens at the hotel ballroom where the debate was being televised.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just glad that someone\u2019s finally saying what they want said,\u201d Erick Erickson, the conference host, said at the time. \u201cDonald Trump is at least willing to throw the punches they [the others] are not willing to throw.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sounds Like A Joke Now\u2019\n\nIn the summer of 2013, then-RNC Chairman Reince Priebus unloaded on his party\u2019s nominee the previous year. \u201cUsing the word \u2018self-deportation\u2019 \u2015 I mean, it\u2019s a horrific comment to make,\u201d he said.\n\nMitt Romney\u2019s suggestion during the primaries, that those in the country illegally would \u201cself-deport\u201d as a result of his policies, was mild compared to statements from other Republicans running that year. Herman Cain, for instance, even proposed an electrified border fence.\n\nNevertheless, Romney\u2019s loss to President Barack Obama in a race many Republicans were confident they would win provoked a serious effort to dig into what went wrong and to fix it before 2016. While many of the reforms had to do with better use of voter data and earlier deployment of field staff into key states, the marquee recommendation was that the party had to do a better job with nonwhite voters, particularly Latinos.\n\n\u201cIf we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,\u201d the report stated. \u201cIf Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.\u201d\n\nAl Cardenas, a former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, recently laughed at the memory, and of the outrage heaped on Romney, given where Trump has taken things.\n\n\u201cSounds like a joke now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe irony of the 2012 \u201cautopsy\u201d recommendation and the eventual victory of Trump was not lost on the party\u2019s elder statesmen back in 2016.\n\n\u201cCertainly Donald Trump has gone in the opposite direction from what we recommended,\u201d Ari Fleischer, a former top aide to President George W. Bush and one of the autopsy\u2019s authors, said at the time. \u201cThe things he is espousing are absolutely detrimental to the party. \u2026 For every good point Trump makes, he makes so many derogatory, nasty points. He loses people when he should be winning people.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think the party can survive just on hoping for more Supreme Court justices. Al Cardenas, former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida\n\nFleischer\u2019s view was common among Republicans \u2015 that Trump would likely lose that November to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and that their party would face a long period of rebuilding.\n\nBut when Trump unexpectedly won, the majority of Republican detractors muted their criticisms and seemed to decide that Trump must have been correct all along \u2015 particularly when he rubber-stamped long-standing GOP goals of cutting taxes, repealing regulations and appointing a list of judges compiled by outside conservative groups.\n\n\u201cDonald, just bring me in more judges. A lot more judges,\u201d Steel, the RNC member, said.\n\nAs to the cost such appeasements to Trump\u2019s character \u2015 near constant falsehoods; frequent outbursts of temper; childish taunts against any and all perceived threats \u2015 will impose on the party, that is a different problem for a different day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the growth and maturation of political parties and political movements,\u201d Steel said, adding that the Republican Party would survive just fine, one way or the other. \u201cIt will probably go on for another 150 years.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Heavy Price\u2019\n\nTo \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d like Cardenas and Weaver, a party that has fashioned itself into supporting the likes of Trump does not deserve to survive, not for any length of time.\n\n\u201cThey became Patty Hearst to Trump\u2019s SLA,\u201d Weaver said of today\u2019s RNC, referring to the publishing heiress who was kidnapped by a left-wing militant group only to later join it. \u201cUntil that is burned down to the ground, and acid thrown on top of it, and we start over, there is no Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the party can survive just on hoping for more Supreme Court justices,\u201d said Cardenas, adding that restoring the party to goals of limited government, free trade and a multilateral foreign policy are still doable now, but will become nearly impossible if Trump were to win a second term.\n\n\u201cIt will depend on how the Trump era ends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the next couple of years are difficult for him, if the economy is difficult for him, if the Mueller report is scathing, if his nomination is in doubt \u2015 then yeah, I think the party can disown him.\u201d\n\nThe first order of business toward that end, Trump\u2019s GOP critics agree, is to make sure a serious Republican runs against him for the 2020 nomination. Only three incumbent presidents have lost elections over the past four decades: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three had credible challenges from within their parties for the nomination. In the case of Ford and Carter, those challenges nearly succeeded.\n\nSo far, Weaver\u2019s once-and-perhaps-future boss Kasich has made the most overt moves toward launching a toward launching a 2020 campaign, with a visit to New Hampshire in November and delivering among the most pointed GOP criticisms of Trump over his first two years. Former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Romney, now a senator from Utah, are also thought to be considering challenges. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the latest focus of speculation, as he plans a trip to Iowa in March.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, center, is seen as a possible challenger to Trump in the 2020 Republican primary.\n\nTrump began raising money for his re-election the day he took office, and will have not only a huge financial edge but the advantages of incumbency \u2015 flying to his rallies aboard Air Force One and winning incalculable amounts of attendant free publicity. And while a damaging report from special counsel Robert Mueller could bring on impeachment proceedings or even a sudden resignation, such circumstances cannot be counted on by potential challengers, Cardenas agreed.\n\nHe hopes at least one candidate will take the fight to Trump regardless. \u201cThere is a true Republican story to be told in a campaign. For the sake of our party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they win the nomination or not, they are preserving the values of the party, and hopefully building a base for the future.\u201d\n\nImplicit is the hope that Trump, should he wind up the nominee, lose his re-election, and that the Democrats take the Senate, as well.\n\n\u201cIt will take significant political pain for the party to disown Donald Trump, and so far we have not experienced that level of pain,\u201d Cardenas said.\n\nThe recent midterm elections, when Republicans lost 40 House seats and control of that chamber, was a respectable start to that \u201cpain,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But he added that by itself is not enough to force lasting change.\n\n\u201cIt will take three election losses in a row,\u201d he said \u2015 meaning Democrats will need to win back the White House and Senate in 2020 and then hold both chambers of Congress in 2022 before it becomes clear to Republicans that they need fundamental reforms.\n\n\u201cIt has to be a recognition that it\u2019s something deep and you have the danger of being sent to the ash bin of history,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can survive the way it\u2019s going. Until and unless it\u2019s replaced by a problem-solving conservative party, and not a Trump party.\u201d\n\nFor Weaver, the danger of leaving behind a \u201cTrump party\u201d is the biggest threat of all \u2015 a generation of local, state and federal elected officials mimicking Trump\u2019s verbiage.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obstruction-report-twitter-reaction_us_5c41826de4b0a8dbe16fb1f4": "The allegation that the President of the United States may have suborned perjury before our committee in an effort to curtail the investigation and cover up his business dealings with Russia is among the most serious to date.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke Tuesday to a packed audience at a local historically black college before heading to an event in North Charleston. The day before, Sanders and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) marched together to the State House, where they each spoke as part of the city\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day events. Later this week, Sen.

Today is 31 points,\u201d Warren continued, causing audible gasps in the audience. \u201cThat\u2019s not an America that\u2019s working for everybody.\u201d\n\nSecuring victory in South Carolina will require winning over the state\u2019s black population, which holds enormous power in Democratic politics here. According to exit polls, black women alone made up 37 percent of the state\u2019s Democratic primary voters in 2016, and black men comprised an additional 24 percent.\n\nSanders, who got shellacked by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 South Carolina primary, tweaked his typical stump speech this week to focus more deeply on struggles specific to black Americans. At the historically black Benedict College on Tuesday, he received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic student body.\n\nNationally, Warren has similarly attempted to better appeal to black voters and try to avoid some of Sanders\u2019 stumbles in 2016. In a New Year\u2019s Eve video announcing her exploratory committee, she stated that \u201cfamilies of color face a path that is [even] steeper and rockier\u201d than do white families. She has forged bonds with the likes of Bernice King, MLK\u2019s youngest daughter, and twice spoke at historically black colleges in 2018 \u2015 first at Dillard University in New Orleans, where she called the country\u2019s criminal justice system \u201cracist.\u201d Then last month at Morgan State University in Baltimore, where she said during a commencement address that the U.S. government had \u201csystematically discriminated against black people in this country.\u201d\n\nAbout 980 people attended the event Wednesday night, according to a Warren aide. And attendees brought handmade signs that included messages like \u201cPersist,\u201d \u201cWe will end corruption\u201d and \u201cFight.\u201d\n\nBut the audience was noticeably whiter than at the week\u2019s previous political events. Considering the unquestionable significance of the black vote in South Carolina, Warren\u2019s decision to pick a predominantly white college (as of 2017) for her first stop in South Carolina this year.\n\n\u201c[It is] certainly something that has been talked about,\u201d said Brady Quirk-Garvan, chairman of the Charleston County Democratic Party. Another former elected official who did not want to be named agreed there had been chatter.\n\nBut Trav Robertson, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said before Warren\u2019s event on Wednesday that he thought such talk was \u201coverly critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she runs for president, she\u2019s going to have a lot of opportunities to visit historically black colleges in South Carolina,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re all just going on first dates with some of these folks.\u201d\n\nErika Brooks, 46, didn\u2019t exactly know what to expect when she attended Warren\u2019s event. The African-American single mother required transplant surgery in 2017, which left her with medical debt on top of her student loan debt.\n\n\u201cI was in my hospital bed recovering from my surgery, had been in a coma for 21 days, and the Student Loan Corp. was like, pay us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now that I have a second chance in life, I have debt. It took $1.5 million to transplant me.\u201d\n\nEven if she somehow digs herself out of the financial hole, she worries what will come after. \u201cWhen I get to be 50, 60, what about retirement?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seriously disappointed in America,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was losing faith, and I wanted to hear that someone cared, someone understood, someone sees the problems that everyday people are facing.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Warren\u2019s staff and operation have been working aggressively to prove they are taking Brooks\u2019 state seriously, according to Quirk-Garvan. \u201cThe senator herself has called me and spent time chatting with me. She made it abundantly clear to me that she\u2019s not writing off this state and she intends to compete pretty vigorously in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nBrian Fallon, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said that dedication has been clear at the national level as well. \u201cTheir political operation has been among the best in terms of making up call sheets for her and orchestrating all the little touches that mean a lot to the people that are on the receiving end of those calls.\u201d\n\nBut Boyd Brown, a former member of the Democratic National Committee and South Carolina House of Representatives who is now working on the \u201cDraft Beto\u201d movement, said Warren has struggled to pull Democrats working within South Carolina\u2019s political structure to her side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to numerous people she\u2019s reached out to in South Carolina, and all of them have pretty much given her the same response: Thanks, but no thanks,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe work Warren has ahead of her in South Carolina was clear at Benedict College, where Sanders was speaking Tuesday. Faith Dupree, a 21-year-old psychology major, said she had never even heard of Warren. The vast majority of students who spoke to HuffPost said the same. \u201cBut if she would definitely come over to Benedict College, we would definitely have a conversation,\u201d Dupree said.\n\nBut for one night, at least, it seemed Warren\u2019s message was getting through. Sean Hoppe, 43, joined his wife to see Warren. Hoppe, a teacher, has voted for both Democratic and Republican candidates in past presidential elections, and he came away impressed with Warren\u2019s values and the way she gave people her full attention.\n\n\u201cI was raised by a very strong woman, and obviously she\u2019s a strong woman, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somebody that I would probably vote for.\u201d\n\nBrooks, the transplant recipient, had not been sure a senator from Massachusetts could relate to the concerns of an \u201ceveryday\u201d Southern woman like her. But she came away more than impressed.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/karen-pence-anti-lgbtq-school_us_5c44618ce4b0bfa693c46f51": "The news that Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, is teaching at D.C.-area school that openly bans LGBT+ faculty and students \u2015 and any manner of pro-LGBT+ belief or affiliation \u2015 seemed to generate a lot of surprise among my peers. Not a surprise that the nation\u2019s second lady would work there, but that such a school would exist \u2014 right in liberal Northern Virginia!\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised. I\u2019d grown up attending such a school. I figured they were a dime-a-dozen.\n\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t keen on reading any of the news stories, but something caught my eye. Immanuel Christian School, in Springfield? I didn\u2019t go to a school like that; I went to that school. From 1989\u20131997. I\u2019m also gay.\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre reading about little ICS in the national media. A common description affixed to it, in this latest culture war dust-up, is \u201can anti-LGBT school.\u201d It\u2019s an odd label, as if being anti-gay were its raison d\u2019etre. But it is, I must say, more than fair.\n\nI\u2019ve been following the reporting, the commentary, the vice president\u2019s public diatribe in response to the backlash against his wife and the school and, given my own experience, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sympathetic to his claims of persecution. Let\u2019s be clear, nobody is arguing that private, religious schools can\u2019t exist or can\u2019t legally discriminate. It\u2019s a clear First Amendment right. And what I was hearing was merely criticism, or in most cases matter-of-fact reporting, of the school\u2019s policies.\n\nThat harsh light of visibility, the audacity to call hate, hate, seems to anger Mike Pence. And his angry response has only further offended those who were appalled by his wife\u2019s choice to teach there in the first place. And \u2019round and \u2019round it goes.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing, I think, when people talk about a discrimination policy like this, is the practical experience of what that actually looks like. It certainly sounds unfair. But it\u2019s so much more than that.\n\nNo student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. That would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ICS.\n\nGrowing up, we had no clue our school had the policy statements or hiring forms it does. No student was, to my knowledge, ever expelled for being gay. That would never happen, because no student would ever dare come out in the stifling environment of ICS. No openly gay or lesbian teacher was ever turned away, because it would have been clear from a mile away this wasn\u2019t the place for them. The policies were there, I\u2019m sure, in a file cabinet somewhere. They stated what would, to anyone attending the institution, go without saying. And they enforced something much more consequential, namely the curriculum.\n\nIt does have to be said that ICS was a good school. It was small, intimate, and \u2014 aside from a middle school biology course that seemed to focus 90 percent on debunking evolution, without actually teaching any of its underlying principles \u2014 the academic education I received there was stellar.\n\nIt was also a hotbed of right-wing fanaticism, shoved down the throats of impressionable children at every turn. The community of teachers, students and families was fiercely like-minded and almost exclusively Republican. In 1992, they held a school-wide vote for the presidential election. George H.W. Bush, seeking a second term that Bill Clinton would deny him, won by a staggering landslide.\n\nThe effect of this environment went beyond the official coursework. Teachers, especially in the later grades, where students started to converse about the topics of the day, would constantly editorialize and share their opinions about the world. They were encouraged to do so, I\u2019m sure, and they presented their views as Gospel fact.\n\nI learned at a very young age how our country was \u201clost\u201d and had the blood of innocent babies on its hands. Gay marriage was an affront to the natural order. Nobody even brought that one up \u2014 our teacher came in one day, in 1996, fuming that a court in Hawaii had suggested otherwise.\n\nHuffPost A school photo of Cronkhite when he was in 6th grade in 1994.\n\nIt was also, apparently, vital to the spiritual survival of our country to always, unwaveringly support the state of Israel. Which, to us students, was a country far, far away where Jesus was from.\n\nBasically, if James Dobson or Rush Limbaugh was saying it, we were hearing it. While many of the messages were probably typically the kind you\u2019d hear in any Christian school, I think they had a particular intensity there. We weren\u2019t in Oklahoma; we were inside the Beltway, in the lion\u2019s den, and the world around us was an evil, corrupt, and frightening place. One day, when we graduated, we would have to go out into this world. We would have to be prepared.\n\n\n\nKaren Pence is going to fit right in.\n\n\n\nEventually, in middle school, discussions would touch on sexuality. Obviously, homosexuality was evil. They didn\u2019t talk about this a whole lot; it was best not to dwell on it, but the unfortunate topic had to be broached. What was shocking, even to me then, was the vitriol. These were Christians and generally very kind people. Evangelicals have a way of talking about sexual minorities in public. They use the word \u201clove\u201d a lot and talk softly of hating the sin. When they\u2019re among themselves, they tend to be more candid. Needless to say, it was made very clear to me, and to all of us, that there was nothing worse than being gay. They were disgusting perverts who hated Christians and had a nefarious agenda to dismantle society.\n\n\n\nAs a boy on the cusp of puberty, only just beginning to realize I was different, this wasn\u2019t a nurturing message, especially coming from a trusted teacher and echoed enthusiastically by everyone I had ever called a friend. I remember wanting to turn invisible, imagining they could tell that maybe, just maybe, I was one of those perverts.\n\nThey\u2019re not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. They\u2019re trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. That\u2019s not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn\u2019t great for me.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t tell though, and I wouldn\u2019t have dared say it. I could barely admit it to myself back then. But time marches on, and I\u2019m now happily married to my husband (despite what my 6th grade teacher would say about that). I made it out. Still, I carried that sense of fear and isolation well into public high school. I grew depressed there. I never attempted suicide, but I certainly thought about it a lot. I wonder sometimes about the other LGBT+ students who went through Immanuel Christian School, before and after me. Were they as resilient? Have any killed themselves?\n\nWhat I do know is any school can be a rough place for a gay kid. There are always bullies. It doesn\u2019t help when the teachers are in on it. Once, in my public high school, when some boys made a cruel, homophobic joke, the teacher cut them off. He then berated them to the point I thought they would cry. I had never seen an adult stand up for people like me before. I didn\u2019t even know that was possible. ICS made sure of that.\n\nThat\u2019s what their discrimination policy is all about. They\u2019re not trying to deny employment to gay people out of spite. They\u2019re trying to keep gay and gay-friendly people from their students. That\u2019s not beneficial to the students, and it certainly wasn\u2019t great for me.\n\nWhile part of me would love to see the supposed liberal-fascist machine shut down schools like ICS, that won\u2019t ever happen. Religious schools are part of this country. So, instead, I would like to see them change from within. And that won\u2019t happen if we refuse to even talk about them. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re talking about this school, and I\u2019m glad people are being critical. Now maybe the Pences are the ones who will have to learn some resilience.\n\nIan Cronkhite grew up in Northern Virginia.

In a Jan. 2 Cabinet meeting, for example, Trump claimed that the then\u2013Soviet Union was correct to invade Afghanistan because terrorists were using it as a base for attacks in the USSR.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) speaks at the Iowa Women's March on Saturday in Des Moines. The speech was part of her first presidential campaign trip.\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2015 When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) walked into Sioux City Gifts on Friday afternoon, the store was virtually empty save for the dozen reporters who had tagged along to document her inaugural presidential campaign swing.\n\nBut after greeting the cashier, Gillibrand spied a lone patron \u2015 visibly stunned to be surrounded by the media entourage \u2015 and immediately introduced herself.\n\nThe customer, Diane Desy, 55, a local retail worker and avid Republican, told Gillibrand she was concerned about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGillibrand asked whether Desy would support comprehensive immigration reform combining, among other things, tougher border security with a pathway to citizenship for those undocumented immigrants already in the country.\n\nDesy responded favorably and the two got to talking about veterans issues. By the time Gillibrand moved on to inspect the store\u2019s photography studio, she had made a dent in Desy\u2019s lifelong allegiance to the GOP.\n\nAlthough the woman said she has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and is relatively satisfied with President Donald Trump, she told reporters she would at least give Gillibrand serious consideration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impressed with her,\u201d Desy said. \u201cI lean more conservative, but I\u2019m not close-minded to other points of view.\u201d\n\nGillibrand, a 52-year-old attorney and 10-year Senate member who announced her presidential run on Wednesday, couldn\u2019t have found a better case study for her presidential pitch if she had invented one from scratch. And sure enough, she referenced Desy \u2015 anonymously \u2015 in virtually every subsequent speech she delivered on the stump in all-important Iowa \u2015 from Boone to Des Moines.\n\nWhile registered Republicans like Desy won\u2019t decide who gets to take on Trump in the 2020 general election, a key part of Gillibrand\u2019s pitch to her fellow Democrats is that she has a record of winning over more conservative voters in rural areas.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images Gillibrand, surrounded by Republican senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas, speaks in 2013 about legislation on dealing with sexual assault in the military. She has touted her ability to work with conservatives.\n\n\u2018I Can Work With Anybody\u2019\n\nOver the course of a 36-hour tour of northwestern and central Iowa on Friday and Saturday, Gillibrand frequently mentioned how much the wintry, agriculture-heavy state reminded her of upstate New York \u2015 the region where she grew up and with her husband raises their two sons.\n\n\u201cI kind of recognize you, because you are hardy and you are hardworking and you don\u2019t give up. It\u2019s a lot like upstate New York Democrats,\u201d she told a capacity crowd of hundreds at the Peace Tree Brewing Co. outlet in Des Moines on Saturday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind the cold, either.\u201d\n\nI kind of recognize you, because you are hardy and you are hardworking and you don\u2019t give up. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)\n\nGillibrand began her political career by upsetting a GOP incumbent in a 2006 House race in a district where Republicans outnumbered Democrats 2 to 1. She recalled to her Iowa listeners that one skeptical consultant claimed the district had \u201cmore cows than Democrats,\u201d and she cited her win as evidence of her ability to prevail in hostile territory.\n\nBut in recounting that first foray into electoral politics, she also was careful to emphasize stances from that run that liberal voters would agree with: opposition to the Iraq War and support for what Gillibrand calls \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (though her plan might more accurately be described as a Medicare buy-in or public option).\n\nThe voters she wooed in that initial race \u201ccared about a lot of the same things you might have cared about \u2015 that rank-and-file Democrats cared about,\u201d Gillibrand said.\n\nShe even managed to make the case that her subsequent Senate wins in New York, a solid blue state in presidential voting, had further honed her political skills. She noted that outside of New York City, the state largely consists of moderate \u201cpurple\u201d and conservative \u201cred\u201d pockets.\n\nIn early 2009, Gillibrand was the surprise gubernatorial pick to temporarily fill the Seate seat Hillary Clinton gave up to become then-President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nGillibrand easily won a 2010 special election for the seat, and in 2012 she won a full term with 72 percent of the vote \u2015 which she told Iowa voters is the highest tally for any statewide candidate in New York history. (In her 2018 re-election win,she picked up 67 percent of the vote, losing many of the rural counties she carried in 2012.)\n\nAt her brewery appearance, Gillibrand appeared to hit her stride rhetorically, letting her sense of humor flow a little more freely than at her previous stops as she spoke against the backdrop of stacked beer barrels.\n\nA joke she had made elsewhere got bigger laughs than before.\n\n\u201cI work with [Sen.] Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on ending sexual harassment in Congress. I can work with anybody,\u201d she said, prompting hoots of laughter and then applause from the crowd.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Nati Harnik Gillibrand greets voters at the Pierce Street Coffee Works caf\u00e9 in Sioux City, Iowa, on Friday. At that stop and others, she pitched herself as a Democrat capable of attracting support from rural voters who could prove crucial to Democratic hopes of winning the White House in 2020.\n\n\u2018Not A National Name\u2019\n\nGillibrand has the challenge \u2015 and perhaps the benefit \u2015 of entering the presidential race with relatively little national name recognition. It\u2019s a reality that she noted at the close of a well-attended question-and-answer session on Saturday at a coffee shop in Ames, thanking local Democrats for showing up even though she is \u201cnot a national name.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one reason why Gillibrand barely registered in a mid-December poll of Iowa Democrats about their preferred presidential candidates in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. (Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both of whom are considering presidential bids, took first and second place, respectively.)\n\nBut it also gives her the chance to shape her brand with voters without having to undo any major preconceived notions about her.\n\nAnd Gillibrand\u2019s argument that her success in rural areas \u2015 as well as in suburbs \u2015 makes her uniquely equipped to take on Trump attempts to turn what may be her greatest liability into a selling point.\n\nThe more conservative stances she took on guns and immigration in the first stages of her political career have prompted scrutiny. In her first House race, she tried to outflank her Republican opponent from the right when it came to cracking down illegal immigration. She also earned an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association for her support of gun rights. (As recently as February 2009, she boasted of keeping two guns under her bed.)\n\nIn Iowa, Gillibrand parried queries about her past stances without getting flustered, chalking up her evolution to more progressive positions to insights she gained upon becoming a senator.\n\nShe is a workhorse in the Senate and that\u2019s one thing I do appreciate. Jefferson Fink, Des Moines voter\n\nResponding to a question from a Democratic activist in Sioux City on Friday about why the NRA once considered her an ally in the fight against greater gun regulation, she grew emotional describing how meeting the parents of a teenager in Brooklyn killed by gun violence helped change her mind about the need to toughen firearm laws. It\u2019s part of what inspired her, she said, to back 2011 legislation cracking down on illegal gun trafficking.\n\n\u201cSince [meeting those parents] 10 years ago, I have been 100 percent trying to end gun violence. I proudly have an \u2018F\u2019 rating from the NRA,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowd responded with approving applause.\n\nBernie Scolaro, a Sioux City public school teacher, was the only Democrat over the course of the trip who told HuffPost that she associated Gillibrand with the successful effort to pressure former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken (D) to resign in December 2017. Gillibrand was the first senator to call for Franken to leave after he faced multiple accusations of unwanted groping and other sexual misconduct.\n\nFranken was popular as an effective Senate voice against Trump, and some Democratic donors have expressed anger that Gillibrand fueled the effort to oust him from office. But she has vehemently defended her action, noting that Franken had been accused credibly by eight women of misconduct when she called on him to resign.\n\nAs Gillibrand spoke at a house party, Scolaro asked the senator about her role in the Franken matter and the criticism it has sparked. Gillibrand replied that she spoke out because she believed she could no longer speak credibly to her teenage son about how to treat women respectfully if she did not act on those same principles in the U.S. Senate.\n\nScolaro seemed persuaded by the answer. \u201cShe was genuine and [Gillibrand\u2019s response] was from the heart,\u201d the woman said afterward.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Matthew Putney Leading Democrats are quickly lining up for presidential bids. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke in Des Moines shortly after announcing her intention to run.\n\nA Focus On Electability\n\nGillibrand is the second Senate Democrat to announce presidential ambitions \u2015 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) jumped into the race on Dec. 31. Those two are not expected to be the last; Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Corey Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are mulling candidacies. And as the party awaits the decisions by Biden and Sanders, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) jumped into the race earlier this month.\n\nUnlike many in what will be a crowded field, Gillibrand doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a particular ideological \u201clane.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of Sanders-style references to Nordic nations, Gillibrand cites her faith in God and the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d when explaining her support for policies like paid family leave. On a key education issue, she tends to stress making the acquisition of professional skills more affordable, rather than eliminating tuition at public colleges (though she has co-sponsored a bill that would do the latter for families making less than $125,000 annually).\n\nAt the same time, Gillibrand is leaning into her opposition to the influence of money in politics, calling for public financing of political campaigns. Like Warren, she has sworn off money from corporate political action committees and support from super PACs.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Gillibrand has gotten behind ambitious progressive policies and legislation in the last two years. She co-sponsored Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation in September 2017, and rolled out her own bill last May that aimed to put payday lenders out of business. In June, she came out in favor of abolishing ICE \u2015 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that has elicited notoriety for its aggressive raids against undocumented immigrants in the nation\u2019s interior.\n\nStill, Gillibrand appears to be betting that touting her electability is a way to distinguish herself among a likely raft of candidates whose populist bona fides are harder to assail.\n\nThat could be a potent formula for Democratic primary voters whose interest in finding a candidate with general-election viability \u2015 who first and foremost can beat Trump \u2015 seems only to have intensified since he took office.\n\n\u201cShe is a workhorse in the Senate and that\u2019s one thing I do appreciate,\u201d said Jefferson Fink, 28, who works at Kitchen Collage in downtown Des Moines. (Gillibrand stopped at the cooking specialty store on Saturday afternoon to bake cookies and discuss her family\u2019s culinary habits.)\n\nFink supported Sanders in Iowa\u2019s 2016 caucuses and he said he would be fine with him entering the race again. This time around though, Fink said he does not yet have a favorite.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-harassment-meeting_us_5c3fef50e4b0a8dbe16d8e32": "In his latest effort to address allegations of sexism as he mulls another bid for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) met Wednesday with about two dozen women who had publicly claimed they were sexually harassed and mistreated while working on his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe meeting, which also included senior aides and an appearance by Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane, took place after the women sent a letter last month asking to sit down with the senator to \u201cdiscuss the issue of sexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign.\u201d Multiple women have spoken out about their experiences, including some who told The New York Times they endured unwanted advances from male campaign staffers. They also said they reported large pay gaps with male colleagues only to have campaign leaders discount them.\n\nPolitico also reported last week that a top adviser to Sanders was accused of forcibly kissing a subordinate at a bar. The man has denied wrongdoing.\n\nSanders, who is still weighing a 2020 presidential campaign, has publicly apologized to former female staffers and pledged to \u201cdo better\u201d the next time he enters a political race.

The allegations speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or workplace. To the women in that campaign who were harassed or mistreated I apologize.\u201d\n\nSanders told both the Times and CNN that the meeting Wednesday, which lasted around an hour, was \u201cprivate\u201d and declined to discuss what was said.

In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the 29-year-old suggested applying this marginal rate only to earnings amounting to more than $10 million. This means that those impacted would pay a much lower share of their income overall and the average tax rate for working Americans could potentially go down under her idea.\n\nA report in CNBC explains how Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea is in line with America\u2019s economic history. While the top tax rate stood above 90 percent throughout the 1950s, deductions and tax avoidance led to taxes on the rich being \u201cnot that much higher,\u201d according to a 2017 article by the Tax Foundation.\n\nA top rate of 70 percent was active up until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan took office. The most affluent 1 percent were paying an average rate of 30.5 percent. By 1989, when Reagan left office, the top rate was reduced to 28 percent \u2014 but average tax rates for the most affluent had only slightly dropped to 27.9 percent.\n\nSince then, the last three decades have had top rates below 40 percent. Many have tried to change that. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 54.2 percent rate for income above $10 million in his 2016 presidential campaign proposal and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposed 43.6 percent for earnings above $5 million.\n\nAs for the congresswoman\u2019s comments on unemployment, she discussed her understanding of how it\u2019s calculated in July 2018 after the press and many members of the GOP ripped her words apart. It\u2019s unclear as to why Goodwin is bringing up the remarks again, half a year later.\n\nUnsure why you leap to interpret my comments in the dimmest light possible - almost as though you have an agenda\ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nCLEARLY, unemployment is unchanged by the # of jobs each person has.\n\n\n\nBut low unemployment doesn\u2019t tell the full story.

But after hearing that Zinke would resign from his post on Jan. 2, Cannon reached out about having him join Artillery One.\n\nThe North Carolina-based company announced Zinke as its senior vice president and managing director in a Monday press release aptly titled \u201cHeavy artillery.\u201d The former interior secretary \u201cbrings a wealth of experience and understanding of the workings of business and government\u201d and will help the firm \u201ccontinue to expand its consulting and finance business in the core areas of cybersecurity, energy, fintech and digital assets,\u201d Cannon said in an accompanying statement.\n\nWilliam Campbell via Getty Images It's an unlikely post-government service job for a man with no apparent background in the finance or technology sectors.\n\nThe company is all but nonexistent online. In October, it hosted a \u201cBlockchain Innovators Summit\u201d in Pebble Beach, California, which it described as the \u201cpreeminent event in the history of blockchain.\u201d It is slated to host another blockchain conference in March in Palm Beach, Florida. The price tag for attendees is $2,000 apiece.\n\nBefore Monday\u2019s announcement, an online search of the company primarily turned up media coverage of the firm\u2019s failed attempt last year to rescue Swiss blockchain firm Monetas from bankruptcy. The deal was terminated in February after a feud between Cannon and Monetas\u2019 founder, SWI swissinfo.ch reported.\n\nIf the former chief steward of America\u2019s natural resources joining a blockchain investment firm wasn\u2019t odd enough, Zinke \u2015 the loyal soldier of Trump\u2019s pro-fossil fuel \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda for the last two years \u2015 appears to have sold himself to Cannon as a someone who understands the immediate threat of climate change and is anxious to see the world transition to clean energy.\n\n\u201cSecretary Zinke understands the need for alternative, renewable energy as climate change is a clear and present danger,\u201d Cannon told ThinkProgress.\n\nAsked about climate change during an Environmental Protection Agency briefing a little more than a month ago, Zinke said he was \u201cproud\u201d the United States is now the largest oil and gas producer in the world \u2015 and \u201cproud of the fact that we\u2019re going to get even better.\u201d He repeatedly downplayed the dire conclusions in the latest federal climate assessment, saying scientists relied on \u201cthe worst scenarios.\u201d And while he pitched himself as a champion of public lands, he spent his time in the administration opening up millions of acres of public land to drilling and mining as he worked to pave a better future for the fossil fuel industry by rolling back environmental safeguards.\n\nAsked to elaborate on his comment to ThinkProgress, Cannon told HuffPost that he personally believes climate change is a serious threat.\n\n\u201cSecretary Zinke feels alternative energy away from fossil fuels is optimal wherever practical,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNatural Gas seems to be the transition fuel to alternative energy (wind, solar, geothermal, wave motion). We both share the opinion that U.S. Soldiers should not be fighting and dying over energy.\u201d\n\nAsked about Zinke\u2019s comment at the EPA briefing and if he\u2019s concerned about his new employee\u2019s history of questioning climate science, Cannon said, \u201cI\u2019m aware that energy independence was/is the mandate of his former boss, President Trump.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Zinke told the Associated Press he had \u201cjoined a winning team.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad to be out of the swamp and free from the chains of office,\u201d he said.\n\nAside from blockchain, the company\u2019s investments include research at the University of California, Los Angeles, into supercapacitors and other technology that would boost battery storage, according to Cannon. And the firm is assisting some micro-nations that are switching \u201cfrom fossil fuels to cleaner renewable energy sources,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe at Artillery One aspire to make the world a clean environment and reduce carbon emissions as much as technology will allow,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cWe will continue to use our influence in financial and technological markets to achieve renewable energy optimization for the world.\u201d\n\nIn its press release, Artillery One said Zinke will be based in Montana and California but the job would also involve \u201cextensive travel overseas.\u201d And working with Cannon, Zinke \u201cwill continue to follow the vision of President Donald J. Trump in Making America Great Again, by bringing economic development, jobs and opportunities for people, at home and internationally,\u201d the company said.\n\nZinke\u2019s first job assignment for Artillery One is a cushy one. He will travel to Switzerland this week to represent his new company at the Crypto Finance Conference, described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most exclusive investor conference on cryptocurrencies and blockchain investments.\u201d The three-day event kicks off Wednesday and is held at a ritzy, five-star hotel in the resort town of St. Moritz.\n\nZinke exited the Interior Department on Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals and some critics speculated he would end up working in the oil and gas industry. Cannon told ThinkProgress reporter Kyla Mandel that he\u2019s not concerned about ongoing federal investigations into Zinke\u2019s conduct and policy decisions while at the federal agency, one of which was recently referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations. And when pressed about the Trump-MAGA mention in the company\u2019s release, Cannon answered, \u201cI have no opinion on that. I stay out of politics. However, I love our country.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-jessica-parker-sex-and-the-city-matt-damon_us_5c45b9dce4b027c3bbc3b9e0": "That third \u201cSex and the City\u201d movie may not have come to fruition, but fans are getting a taste of Carrie Bradshaw for the first time in years \u2015 and we have Matt Damon to thank for it.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker appears as the beloved character in the latest campaign for Water.org, dubbed Pour It Forward, an initiative with Stella Artois to help raise money and awareness for Damon and Gary White\u2019s nonprofit organization \u2015 aimed at providing safe water and sanitation to millions of people around the world.\n\nIn the new spot, you\u2019ll hear the familiar \u201cSex and the City\u201d theme music and watch Parker in a scene similar to the series\u2019 opener, filmed on the streets of Manhattan next to a New York City transit bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d Parker told HuffPost about playing Bradshaw. \u201cIt was really fun. Slightly peculiar in the best possible way. It was especially meaningful because the purpose was to amplify this initiative.\u201d\n\nHBO Parker in the opening credits of \"Sex and the City,\" which ran from 1998 to 2004 on HBO.\n\nParker said she decided to get on board because of the creative treatment of the shoot \u2015 and the cause itself.\n\n\u201cI think just being right and clever about how they wanted to present Carrie for this particular idea \u2014 I relied upon their good taste and the subversive nature of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s smart. \u2026 In the past, you have a script and you have all the words you need to remind you if you\u2019ve been away for a while. But this felt like an alternate universe. I was surrounded by smart and good people. It was really easy and really fun.\u201d\n\nDamon said he was thrilled Parker agreed to reprise the role and \u201cthe iconic moment\u201d from the opening credits, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s going to have everyone\u2019s attention ... and that\u2019s a huge megaphone she\u2019s using to help this cause.\u201d\n\nDamon and White founded Water.org in 2009, and since then, the organization has helped some 16 million people gain access to safe and clean water. With Pour It Forward, they\u2019re hoping to increase that number. With every Stella Artois beverage purchased, a donation goes to Water.org.\n\nDamon told HuffPost learned about the need for clean water in developing countries on a trip to rural Zambia, where he met a young girl in a small village and saw the potential long-term benefits of access to safe sanitation.\n\nHe asked the girl if she wanted to stay in the village when she grew up. Her answer? \u201cNo way. I\u2019m moving to the big city, to the capital. I\u2019m going to Lusaka. I\u2019m going to be a nurse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just reminded me of being 14 years old and being with Ben Affleck and saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to get out of here. We\u2019re going to go to the big city of New York, and we\u2019re going to be actors.\u2019 And just that feeling of hope and possibility that all 14-year-olds should have,\u201d Damon said.\n\nDia Dipasupil via Getty Images Matt Damon speaks about Water.org, which he co-founded with Gary White to increase access to safe water and sanitation worldwide, in New York City in January 2018.\n\nSince then, Damon helped build the organization to what it is today. He\u2019s hopeful they\u2019ll be able to aid even more people in the years to come. According to Water.org, 1 in 9 people lacks access to safe water, and 1 in 3 people lacks access to a toilet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge demand,\u201d Damon said about the need for clean access to water in developing countries. \u201cAs Bill Clinton said to us in 2010 \u2014 this is before we hit our first million people \u2014 and he looked at our model, and he took us aside and he said, \u2018Just run the numbers up. This is going to work.\u2019 And the more it works, the more undeniable it becomes. We\u2019re at this inflection point where we\u2019re really starting to scale. We hit our first million people in 2012, and now we\u2019re hitting over a million a quarter. So as the word gets out, it\u2019s huge for us. \u2026 As Carrie Bradshaw trades in her cosmo for a Stella, that\u2019s huge for us. And so it\u2019s all part of this same effort to really scale.\u201d\n\nParker is one of many celebrities getting involved in the initiative.

Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) was elected chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Trade despite a voting history that irked organized labor.\n\nDemocrats rejected a stalwart union ally\u2019s bid to chair the House panel charged with overseeing international trade, in favor of a more business-friendly choice.\n\nDemocratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday elected Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) as chairman of the panel\u2019s Subcommittee on Trade, defying organized labor and left-leaning trade critics who had pushed for Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) to get the top spot in conversations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other top Democrats.\n\nIn particular, Blumenauer drew ire among critics of corporate influence in trade agreements for his key role in enabling passage of trade promotion authority in 2015. Known as fast-track authority, it assures presidents an up-or-down vote in Congress on international trade deals, precluding a lengthy debate and amendment process. At the time, it was widely viewed as a prerequisite for passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a controversial 12-nation trade pact negotiated by then-President Barack Obama but opposed by a majority of House Democrats.\n\nReferring to the subcommittee vote, a House Democratic aide who requested anonymity for professional reasons said, \u201cThey threw labor under the bus and gave them the middle finger.\u201d\n\nUnions are taking a more pragmatic approach, shifting their focus to keeping pressure on Blumenauer.\n\n\u201cThis chairman, though he was not our preferred choice \u2014 you play the hand you get dealt, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said a union official involved in lobbying for Pascrell who requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nAs if to validate unions\u2019 concerns, the pro-business conservative Club for Growth praised Blumenauer\u2019s selection.\n\nBlumenauer is a radical Lefty on most things, but on trade, he's pretty decent. Big Sugar is no fan of him, and that's good. https://t.co/Yu2I7wiiVY \u2014 Club for Growth (@club4growth) January 16, 2019\n\nPascrell\u2019s backers were particularly peeved that Ways and Means members did not give precedence to his recent experience as a trade policy leader.\n\nBlumenauer has a year of seniority over Pascrell in Congress, having arrived in 1996.\n\nBut in the last Congress, when Democrats were in the minority, Pascrell served as the ranking Democrat on the trade subcommittee. Blumenauer declined the top job, which requires hard work without the perks and power of a chairmanship. (Blumenauer told HuffPost in an interview this month that he had simply wanted to focus on defending the Affordable Care Act, which was then under attack.)\n\nAnd while defying party leadership is often grounds for political exile in Congress, Blumenauer has advanced despite a very public act of insubordination. He not only supported fast-track approval for trade deals in 2015 but also defied Democratic leaders in voting for a rule that enabled it to come up for a vote.\n\n\u201cIt seems completely illogical,\u201d the aide said.\n\nThe committee\u2019s rejection of Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a dyed-in-the-wool advocate of pro-business free trade agreements far more anathema to unions than Blumenauer, might have provided some solace to progressive trade hawks. But most Congress watchers never considered Kind a real contender, thanks to his vote against the election of California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker this month.\n\nPascrell may have been hampered by the failure of left-wing activists to land spots on the Ways and Means Committee for some of the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019 most outspoken stars. A grassroots campaign to seat Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Ro Khanna (Calif.) \u2015 a co-chair and vice chair of the CPC, respectively \u2015 as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) on Ways and Means fell short last week.\n\nThe influential panel, which has broad authority over tax and trade policy, now has 25 Democratic members, of whom 11 are new. Eight of those 11 are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but since there are no ideological prerequisites for membership in the nominally left-leaning CPC, few of them are reliably populist firebrands.\n\nLauren Victoria Burke/Associated Press Organized labor and left-leaning trade critics had hoped that Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) would chair the Subcommittee on Trade.\n\nAlthough trade policy is often the province of a small coterie of interest groups and experts, it could be an area of enormous influence for Democrats in the new Congress. President Donald Trump needs approval from both houses of Congress to enact a revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nTrade policy has divided the Democratic Party in recent decades, with Obama and Bill Clinton signing major international trade agreements against the wishes of organized labor and many congressional Democrats.\n\nAdvocates for free trade agreements argue that they provide cheaper goods for American consumers and new markets for American exporters, as well as magnify soft U.S. power on the global stage.\n\nCritics in organized labor have charged that lowering trade barriers with lower-wage countries costs the United States middle-class jobs and encourages a global race to the bottom in labor and environmental standards. Other opponents of trade deals focus on their protection of prescription drug patent monopolies and corporate sops like the international arbitration system, through which companies can challenge signatories\u2019 domestic laws.\n\nTrump broke with his recent Democratic and Republican predecessors by running as an unabashed opponent of international trade agreements. Dissatisfaction with those accords likely helped him win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2015 industry-heavy states that Obama won twice.\n\nA dirty secret of the present political moment is that unions and other left-leaning critics of past trade policy see Trump\u2019s aggressive enforcement of trade rules in general and get-tough approach with China in particular as an improvement on the status quo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one area where Trump has kinda, sorta delivered,\u201d said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, which studies corporate consolidation and power.\n\nThe union official put it more bluntly: \u201cEven a broken clock is right twice a day.\u201d\n\nThe only question for organized labor, Stoller and other trade hawks is whether Democrats will counter Trump\u2019s efforts to reconfigure American trade relations with their own, more progressive form of trade populism or return to the more corporate-friendly, Clinton-Obama paradigm.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a reimagining of what our global order looks like \u2015 and it isn\u2019t going to look like America being a sucker all the time anymore,\u201d Stoller said.\n\nIn his interview this month, Blumenauer strongly disputed any notion that he was a down-the-line free trade proponent, noting his opposition to the Central American and Colombian trade agreements.\n\nHe also insisted that he has a long record of supporting tougher enforcement of trade rules, including but not limited to the issue of illegal logging \u2015 a key concern in Oregon.\n\n\u201cI was all over the Obama people because they weren\u2019t aggressive enough,\u201d Blumenauer said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/khloe-kardashians-favorite-new-accessory-is-a-kanye-for-president-hat_us_5c4b4048e4b0e1872d434fd3": "Khloe Kardashian is throwing her hat into the political ring by endorsing brother-in-law Kanye West\u2019s potential presidential run.\n\nAfter posting her seventh cryptic and vaguely inspirational quote for the day, the reality TV star shared multiple photos of herself fingermouthing for the camera (a KarJenner family pastime) while sporting a \u201cKanye For President\u201d baseball cap.\n\nThe hat is seemingly inspired by Donald Trump\u2019s own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d merchandise with West\u2019s model using a similar font and capital lettering.\n\nKardashian was spotted wearing her new favorite accessory earlier on Friday during an outing with sister Kourtney Kardashian, pairing the hat with a knee-length camel coat, Louis Vuitton fanny pack and oversized sunglasses.\n\nThe Yeezy designer first threatened a run for president when accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards during a now-tame-in-comparison speech.\n\n\u201cI have decided in 2020 to run for president,\u201d he announced in the closing moments of the speech.\n\nThe declaration wasn\u2019t exactly taken seriously at the time but did manage to catch the attention of the official Twitter account of the Democratic Party, which encouraged him to run.\n\nLast night @kanyewest declared his candidacy for president in 2020.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) jumped into the 2020 presidential race on Tuesday with a campaign that will make gender more of a central focus than any other candidate.\n\nThe focus was clear right from the start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to run for president of the United States because, as a young mom, I am going to fight for other people\u2019s kids as hard as I fight for my own, which is why I believe health care is a right and not a privilege,\u201d Gillibrand said on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d when she announced the formation of her exploratory committee.\n\nIn a two-minute introductory video released with her announcement, the first thing highlighted is that she\u2019s a mom to two boys.\n\nGillibrand has been an advocate for getting more women involved in politics and has made women\u2019s issues a focus of her work in the Senate. Women powered the 2018 midterm elections, leading to a record number of women running for office and getting elected to seats in the House. Much of Gillibrand\u2019s strategy rests on winning over these engaged female voters.\n\n\u201cKirsten has been a champion for women and families her entire career, and she is excited to show voters her style of leadership focused on compassion, courage and the determination to get things done,\u201d said Gillibrand communications director Meredith Kelly.\n\n\u201cThe campaign believes that the lesson of 2018 is that the future of the Democratic Party is with women; opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is fueled by women; a majority of women around the country took a greater interest in politics and became more involved in the political process after 2016,\u201d a Gillibrand adviser added. \u201cThey contributed, volunteered, voted, ran for office and won.\u201d\n\nGillibrand, of course, isn\u2019t the only woman running for president, and she isn\u2019t starting out as a frontrunner. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) have already announced that they\u2019re running, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is widely expected to jump into the field as well.\n\nBut Gillibrand is expected to make gender a more central component of her run than any of the other candidates in the race, reflecting the focus of her time in the Senate.\n\nShe is perhaps best known for her years-long fight against sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. She also pushed her Senate colleagues to pass legislation overhauling how Congress deals with sexual harassment in its ranks.\n\nGillibrand\u2019s introductory video also highlighted her work securing funds for 9/11 first responders, repealing \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and opposing Trump\u2019s agenda. But even those accomplishments subtly seemed to play to her emphasis on being a mom, stressing that she can get things done.\n\nMore recently, Gillibrand has been in the national spotlight for calling out prominent men in the Democratic Party for sexual harassment \u2015 moves that have earned her some enemies.\n\nIn November 2017, Gillibrand said that Bill Clinton should have resigned as president during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Calling out the former president was shocking within the party, but it was even more eye-catching because Gillibrand was close to the Clinton world and Hillary Clinton was something of a mentor to her.\n\nThe following month, Gillibrand then became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct.\n\nThe move wasn\u2019t all that surprising, considering Gillibrand\u2019s record and career. But it still angered some of Franken\u2019s defenders, including prominent donors like George Soros saying they would refuse to support her in 2020.\n\nGillibrand refused to back down and went after Soros.\n\n\u201cIf standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that\u2019s on him,\u201d Gillibrand told HuffPost in August. \u201cBut I won\u2019t hesitate to always do what I think is right.

Marvel even offered to help coordinate with the church, according to Ollie\u2019s parents, Pete and Jane Gardiner of Buckinghamshire, England.\n\n\u201cAfter a little persuasion, the church said we could have him on a few conditions, one of which being that the Marvel Corporation gave their permission,\u201d one of his parents wrote Tuesday on \u201cOllie Gardiner\u2019s Brain Tumour fighting page.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that would be impossible to obtain, but contacted [Marvel] anyway,\u201d the post continues. \u201cTwo weeks later I received an email and not only did they give permission, but also offered their help in mediating with the Church of England.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a lovely gesture,\u201d the post continues. \u201cOllie will be smiling down knowing his idol will be with him for eternity.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-congress-nancy-pelosi_us_5c2e3dbfe4b08aaf7a9726cc": "A record number of female legislators just took power in Congress \u2015 led, of course, by the newly anointed Speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nAnd President Donald Trump may find that his playbook for dealing with women \u2014 a classic sexist mixture of paternalism, leering and straight-up name-calling and misogyny, sprinkled with the occasional nondisclosure agreement \u2014 isn\u2019t going to work against this unprecedented female offense.\n\nThe female forces aligned against Trump involve more than Pelosi, who on Thursday officially became the most powerful female politician in the country (again).\n\nHe\u2019ll have to contend with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) the new chair of the House Financial Services Committee. She said that looking at Trump\u2019s finances will be on the to-do list. There\u2019s also savvy and vocal opposition coming from freshmen like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAnd then there\u2019s a clutch of women in the Senate, all gearing up for a presidential run. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was first out of the gate this week; but expect Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to provide a steady stream of criticism, well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have powerful, competent women coming at him in all directions,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nTrump\u2019s go-to strategy of name-calling and ad hominem attacks is not going to work against this onslaught, she said. Calling these women weak, suggesting he can ruin their careers \u2014 all strategies he\u2019s done with men he doesn\u2019t respect \u2014 will be an instant reminder of the president\u2019s sexism.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to avoid daily reminders of the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape, then he can\u2019t deal with these powerful female adversaries the same way he\u2019s accustomed to dealing with powerful male adversaries,\u201d Lawless said.\n\nOf course, Trump has had to face off with powerful women before, but typically these were one-offs. In the race against Hillary Clinton, already the subject of a good portion of the country\u2019s hatred, he was able to tap the misogynist well. He was successful in demeaning Warren by calling her Pocahontas. His strategy with Angela Merkel? Ignore. At one event, Trump notably avoided making eye contact.\n\nThe difference this time is he\u2019s outnumbered. And that\u2019s crucial.\n\nHaving more women in power makes a real difference when it comes to battling sexism \u2014 that\u2019s true in the boardroom, where it\u2019s generally recognized that you need at least three female directors in order to have truly meaningful diversify. And it\u2019s true in politics, too.\n\nAlone, one woman can do a little to combat sexism, but together, a diverse group can break through insidious stereotypes and take on men like Trump \u2014 who\u2019ve spent their careers ignoring women.\n\nPelosi gets this.\n\n\u201cHave you ever been to a meeting when you\u2019re at the table, and a woman makes a suggestion, and then they go to the next person, and then two persons later a man makes the same suggestion, the other gentleman at the table say, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea\u2019?\u201d Pelosi asked CNN\u2019s Dana Bash recently.\n\nThe whole listening to women thing will hopefully be less of a problem now that there are so many women in Congress, Pelosi told The New York Times.\n\nThe 78-year-old congresswoman has been training her whole life for this moment \u2014 beginning her career in Congress as only one of 23 women in the House, wrangling power away from a bunch of men who weren\u2019t exactly itching to mentor her.\n\nShe isn\u2019t here to coddle the president, as the women in his orbit tend to do. Indeed, one of the only high-ranking women in the Trump administration calls the President \u201cdad.\u201d\n\nAnd Pelosi won\u2019t be cowed by his insults. \u201cI know how to take a punch,\u201d she told Bash. \u201cI put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWe got a taste of how she handles Trump at the end of last year, when she swooped into the Oval Office for a meeting that was supposed to be a photo op and turned into a Democratic public relations coup when she and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) got Trump to take credit for the government shutdown that is currently in its 12th day.\n\nAt the meeting, available in its entirety on C-SPAN, she dismantled Trump who tried his best to only talk to the men in the room (another tactic he\u2019s used with powerful women).\n\nPelosi chided him at one point by saying, \u201cdon\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring.\u201d Those words are now immortalized on a T-shirt in her office, the Times reported.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/julian-castro-president-2020-obama-housing_us_5c17e52ae4b030ed3ed01bc7": "SAN ANTONIO \u2015 Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro officially announced a run for the White House on Saturday, becoming one of the first fully committed candidates in what is expected to become a crowded contest for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cSo many journeys for me and my family have started right here,\u201d Castro told a crowd at Guadalupe Plaza on San Antonio\u2019s west side, blocks from the home where he grew up and the church where he was baptized. \u201cToday we begin another one.\u201d\n\nHe then rattled off a list of campaign pledges that planted him squarely within the rising progressive side of the Democratic Party. He reaffirmed his rejection of corporate PAC money and support for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d called for bail reform and promised that his first executive action would be to rejoin the Paris climate accord.\n\n\u201cThere is a crisis today,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis of leadership. President Trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation.\u201d\n\nCastro, 44, has long showed signs of high political ambitions, but was not known for staking out controversial positions until he launched his presidential exploratory committee last month. Since then, he has struck a markedly more left-wing tone, and his speech Saturday repeatedly hit upon progressive themes.\n\nHe attacked President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, highlighting the White House\u2019s six-week experiment with systematically splitting parents from their children at the border.\n\n\u201cYeah, we have to have border security,\u201d Castro said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a smart and a humane way to do it. And there is no way in hell that taking babies is a smart or humane way to do it.\u201d\n\nCastro also delved into the issue of race, casting prominent police killings of people of color as symptomatic of America\u2019s wider problems with racial discrimination.\n\n\u201cFor far too many people of color, any interaction with the police can become fatal,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIf police in Charleston can arrest Dylann Roof after he murdered nine people worshipping at Bible study without hurting him, don\u2019t tell me that Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Aiyana Jones, Eric Garner, Jason Pero, Stephon Clark and Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t still be alive today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep saying Black Lives Matter,\u201d the candidate added.\n\nCastro rose to national prominence in 2012 when the then-mayor was selected to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. He joined the Obama administration as the head of HUD two years later, giving him a national profile and feeding speculation that he might become the running mate of his party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee. (Hillary Clinton ultimately chose Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia instead.)\n\nOver the last two years, however, Castro\u2019s star has waned, as he stayed out of electoral politics while former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke ran an underdog campaign that brought Texas Democrats within striking distance of winning statewide office for the first time in two decades.\n\nInstead, Castro played a quieter role behind the scenes, supporting dozens of young and progressive candidates around the country through his political action committee Opportunity First.\n\n\u201cHe crisscrossed the country in support of candidates,\u201d Latino Victory Fund Director Crist\u00f3bal Alex told HuffPost. \u201cHe was one of the most sought-after Latino surrogates in the country.\u201d\n\nCastro had already indicated his intentions to run, making a trip to Iowa in August ahead of the midterm elections, releasing a memoir in October and launching an exploratory committee in December, which gave him the legal ability to begin raising campaign money.\n\nIn a video announcing the exploratory committee last month, he highlighted the importance of good health care, education and a clean environment. He also stressed the value of hard work, which he said he and his twin brother, Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro (D-Texas), learned from their immigrant grandmother and their single mother.\n\n\u201cShe taught my brother and me that if you want to make a change in your life, in your community, you don\u2019t wait, you work,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro said of his mother in the video. \u201cSo I\u2019m taking a lesson from my mother \u2014 if we want to see a change in this country, we don\u2019t wait. We work. We make our future happen.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Castro will likely face off against Massachusetts Sen.

Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) is the favored union choice to chair the House's key subcommittee on trade policy.\n\nThe fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement lies in the hands of the Democratic-controlled House, whose approval President Donald Trump will need to enact a revised version of the 25-year-old accord.\n\nNow organized labor, an influential foe of free trade agreements, wants to make sure a trusted friend shepherds that process in the House so that its voice is fully heard.\n\nSeveral major labor unions are pressing Democratic House leaders to make Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey \u2015 who had been the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s subcommittee on trade when Republicans ruled the House in the last Congress \u2015 the new chairman of that subcommittee.\n\nPascrell, a union ally, is keen to ensure Trump ratifies a fundamentally pro-worker North American trade agreement. Labor leaders consider the current revisions an improvement on the status quo, but believe it can still be toughened to help workers.\n\nBut Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Ron Kind (D-Wis.), both of whom are seen as friendlier to recent international trade agreements, are also vying for the top post.\n\nBlumenauer and Kind declined the ranking member position in the last Congress, but they have slightly more seniority than Pascrell.\n\n\u201cPascrell\u2019s done a great job as ranking member. He\u2019s attuned with our concerns in our approach to trade,\u201d said Shane Larson, legislative director for the Communications Workers of America.\n\nCWA, which represents over 100,000 call center and manufacturing workers whose jobs are vulnerable to offshoring, is coordinating its push for Pascrell with other manufacturing unions. These include the United Steel Workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Auto Workers and the International Association of Machinists, according to a union official familiar with the effort. (Aside from CWA, none of the individual unions agreed to comment about their efforts.)\n\n\u201cThere is a consensus in general that Pascrell would be a better chair of the subcommittee,\u201d said the union official, who requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\n\u201cPutting a free trader as chair of the subcommittee sends a very bad message to the main constituency on [trade] reform: the labor movement,\u201d the official said.\n\nA particular concern for organized labor and like-minded experts at Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, a consumer group skeptical of past trade policies, is Blumenauer and Kind\u2019s support for the fast-track authority ensuring an up-or-down vote in Congress on any trade deal negotiated by the president.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House approved the fast-track power, known as Trade Promotion Authority, in 2015 over the objections of the overwhelming majority of the House Democratic Caucus and its leadership.\n\nCritics of TPA argue that it deprives Congress of the essential right to debate and amend trade agreements before an up-or-down floor vote.\n\nMany Democrats also viewed the vote on TPA as a de-facto referendum on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, since Obama planned to eventually use TPA to pass the TPP.\n\nObama and other proponents of the TPP insisted it would be a net benefit for the U.S. economy by opening markets for U.S. exports. They also argued that the deal would provide a key check on Chinese power in the Pacific Rim.\n\nPutting a free trader as chair of the subcommittee sends a very bad message to the main constituency on [trade] reform: the labor movement. Union official\n\nBut labor unions, as well as many public health, consumer and environmental groups, opposed the mammoth trade deal on the grounds it would provide lopsided benefits to corporations at the expense of workers, consumers and the environment.\n\nWith organized labor\u2019s blessing, House Democrats had the votes to block the 2015 consideration of TPA in the chamber. But against the wishes of Democratic leaders, a group of eight Democrats \u2015 including Blumenauer and Kind \u2015 backed a congressional \u201crule\u201d clearing the way for a vote on fast-track authority. The rule passed by five votes, making the support from those eight Democrats essential.\n\nTrump, of course, immediately shelved the Trans-Pacific Partnership upon taking office and named as U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, known for his tough stance of trade issues. That has given skeptics of international trade deals in both parties a chance to beat back a decades-long bipartisan consensus in favor of agreements that they consider unduly deferential to corporate interests.\n\nTrump\u2019s renegotiation of NAFTA virtually dissolves the controversial international arbitration system enabling corporations to challenge domestic laws in signatory countries. The deal would also require 40 percent of cars and 45 percent of trucks to be made by workers earning $16 an hour in order for those vehicles to be imported into the U.S. without tariffs.\n\nBut unions and their Democratic allies fear that another provision protecting the right of Mexican workers to unionize, which they see as essential to boosting Mexican wages, is not likely to be enforced.\n\n\u201cFor us, underlying all of this is the outsourcing of jobs,\u201d Pascrell told HuffPost in a recent interview.\n\nIf a new deal strengthens labor protections in Mexico, he added, \u201cthen we\u2019ll keep jobs here.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, naming Blumenauer or Kind to head the subcommittee would turn the clock back to the time when multinational corporations had more influence over trade policy in both parties, according to Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch.\n\n\u201cThe corporate trade agenda is under threat in a way that the corporate lobbies hope a Blumenauer or a Kind could try and ... change,\u201d Wallach said.\n\nKind is unlikely to be tapped for the top trade position \u2015 it likely didn\u2019t help that last week he voted against California Democrat Nancy Pelosi becoming House speaker.\n\nBut organized labor and other critics of free trade deals worry that Blumenauer has a fighting chance at getting the nod.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Steve Dykes Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) appears to be Pascrell's main competition for the chairmanship of the trade subcommittee -- a pick that the House's newly installed Democratic leaders will make.\n\nIn a Tuesday interview with HuffPost, Blumenauer vehemently defended his record on trade. He noted his votes against the Colombia and Central America free trade agreements, and his successful efforts to ramp up enforcement of trade deals, including a crackdown against illegal logging.\n\n\u201cI have no intention of picking a fight with Bill Pascrell. But if you look at our records ... [mine is] much more in line with what much more of the Ways and Means Democrats and... the caucus as a whole [supports],\u201d Blumenauer said. He later acknowledged that his support for TPA broke with most of the caucus.\n\nAlthough Blumenauer teamed up with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in 2015 to promote a TPP-style agreement to expand export markets for U.S. goods and services, he insisted that he never came out in support of the text of the TPP as it finally stood.\n\nOrganized labor is attempting to flex its muscle on trade policy at a time when the Congressional Progressive Caucus and outside progressive activist groups are engaged in a more public bid to shape the assignments for powerful House committees.\n\nThe co-chairs of the CPC leveraged their endorsement of Pelosi\u2019s speakership for a promise that they would receive proportional representation \u2015 40 percent of seats \u2015 on five top committees: Ways and Means; Energy and Commerce; Appropriations; Financial Services; and Intelligence.\n\nBut unlike the CPC and its allies, who have openly marshaled grassroots support for their efforts, the unions have limited their lobbying for Pascrell to closed-door discussions with leadership.\n\nIn 2016, Trump narrowly won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2015 three states that cost Hillary Clinton the election \u2015 at least partly thanks to his opposition to trade deals. Democrats now have an opportunity to seize the populist high ground as they debate the NAFTA revisions and seek to improve them, according to CWA\u2019s Larson.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-lawyer-trump_us_5bfdf5f8e4b0f43bf2661440": "One of Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyers regularly briefed President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team about his client\u2019s conversations with federal investigators as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Times, citing Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and two other sources familiar with the conversations, said attorney Kevin Downing regularly briefed the president\u2019s legal team about what Manafort had discussed during interviews and what angles of inquiry Mueller was investigating.\n\nThe alleged conversations happened after Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, reached a plea deal with Mueller\u2019s team and began cooperating with his investigation. The Times notes that the backchannel, which it called \u201chighly unusual,\u201d may have been part of an effort to score a presidential pardon.

The Guardian on Tuesday said the pair met several times, in 2013, 2015 and around March 2016, although it\u2019s unclear what they spoke about. Trump hired Manafort at the end of March 2016.\n\nThrough a representative, Manafort denied the meetings took place.\n\nSeparately, The Washington Post on Tuesday reported that conservative author Jerome Corsi told Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, that WikiLeaks was planning to release damaging information on 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Corsi\u2019s email to Stone was sent in August of that year. The special counsel\u2019s office has been working on a plea negotiation with Corsi, although such talks have reportedly collapsed.\n\nThe Post notes that the account demonstrates WikiLeaks may play a central role in any case Mueller is building as part of his probe.\n\nTrump himself has gone on the attack this week, regularly lambasting the Mueller inquiry on Twitter and in interviews.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace,\u201d he said in a message on Tuesday, calling the probe a \u201cPhony Witch Hunt\u201d in another.\n\n\u201cMueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other,\u201d the president said. \u201cWait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie.

He has a segment, called \u201cThe Cuck Zone,\u201d in which he often criticizes the Trumpier segments of the GOP.\n\nAccepting Miller as a friendly face in liberal circles required a certain transient amnesia about what the Republican Party is and how Miller has served it. The effort of not knowing became a lot harder on Wednesday, when The New York Times published a blockbuster report that, among other unseemly details, revealed that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm to push back against anti-Facebook groups. The campaign exploited the anti-Semitism on the right, encouraging reporters \u201cto explore the financial connections between [George] Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe Republican operative behind the campaign was none other than Miller.\n\nThis created an awkward situation for the boys of Crooked Media. When the story first dropped, Favreau disgustedly tweeted out the paragraph about the smears, seemingly without realizing it was his buddy who had propagated them. Several hours of silence later, the official Crooked Media account announced that Miller would not be contributing to Crooked while Favreau, Lovett and Vietor got \u201cto the bottom of Tim\u2019s involvement in this work.\u201d\n\nBut what about his involvement in their work? Miller\u2019s presence on the Crooked team was a modern media spin on a familiar phenomenon: prominent liberals inviting the right-wing weasels into the living room, allegedly in the interest of getting a different perspective, the totally predictable result of which is an orgy of special pleading and whitewashing. These days, there are few better publicists for the forces of illiberalism than the establishment liberals who wish to appear broad-minded.\n\nTo be fair, the bros of Crooked Media aren\u2019t wholly part of this same establishment liberal rot. They are far more humane and grounded than your average left-of-center D.C. politico. (I should mention here that I have appeared on Lovett\u2019s podcast). They don\u2019t really whine about civility. They don\u2019t make meaningless calls for bipartisanship (in government, at least). And for the most part, they rarely punch left. But they do have a weakness common to liberal creatures of the D.C. professional political class: their token Never Trumper.\n\nMuch like David Frum and Bill Kristol, Tim Miller has capitalized on his status as one of the country\u2019s dozen Never Trump Republicans for which establishment media remains insatiably horny. Miller puts a charming millennial twist on the type, perfect for the more youthful \u201cPod Save America\u201d crowd. He\u2019s become a regular contributor on Crooked Media\u2019s podcasts and has even written for its website.\n\nHere\u2019s what Miller had to say for himself, regarding his little Facebook anti-Semitism oopsie:\n\nFor ppl asking - Definers shared a narrow document about an anti-Facebook group's funding. It was entirely factual, as Open Markets organizers have acknoweldged they get funding from Soros. I have defended Soros from smears & conspiracies that weren't based in fact. 1/ \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 15, 2018\n\nAll he did was share a document about an anti-Facebook group\u2019s funding \u2014 and a factual document, no less. It\u2019s not his fault the Jews really were behind it!\n\nThe thing is, every group needs funding. It\u2019s unclear why George Soros funding this group, in particular, would have been noteworthy. Unless, of course, you want to make use of the long history of anti-Semitic smears and conspiracies swirling around Soros for political gain. Nothing in Miller\u2019s explanation indicates that he did anything less.\n\nAnd he knew exactly what it was he was doing.\n\nI'm no fan of Soros' politics but the fact that the conservative media is spinning him donating half a billion dollars to support refugees fleeing terror and oppression is a good sign of the moral rot on the right. https://t.co/4HIzgTHLx8 \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 5, 2018\n\nWhere the alt-righters handed out their Protocols of the Elders of Zion pamphlets in public, Miller tried to achieve similar ends with a raised eyebrow behind closed doors. Maybe Miller doesn\u2019t like Trump and his kind because they\u2019re giving the game away.\n\nBut why would a bunch of Obama administration alums even bother with a professional Republican operative in the first place? According to their statement, its because Miller \u201chas interesting things to say about the Republican Party in the Trump era.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see what those interesting things are:\n\n\u201cThe politician x got $ in exchange for dead kids\u201d isn\u2019t just rhetorically out of bounds it is also wrong and counterproductive. Even if you grant that a pol is opposing gun control bc of politics it\u2019s pressure from base *voters* not a few thousand bucks that\u2019s doing it. 1/ \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) March 25, 2018\n\nVery interesting! Unfortunately, it\u2019s also incorrect, or at least it\u2019s defining \u201cbase voters\u201d so narrowly as to render them politically meaningless. The vast majority of Americans \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 want stricter gun control. But it\u2019s understandable why someone who benefits from politicians raking in piles of toxic cash might want people to believe otherwise.\n\nLet\u2019s see what else he\u2019s got.\n\nThis is a beautiful Heidi ad on her sister's adoption. Think it has hurt national Democrats that most have traded in the \"rare\" and \"life\" parts of the debate in favor of only waving pro-abortion pom poms. https://t.co/sDB3xCFQKs \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 19, 2018\n\n\u201cPro-abortion pom poms.\u201d\n\nThe only conceivable reason to ally yourself with someone like Miller is to show the world how tolerant and reasonable you are. In return, the Never Trumpers get even more cash and a crucial credibility boost among liberals and centrists.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if Favreau, Lovett and Vietor didn\u2019t know who it was they were boosting. From 2007 to 2009, Miller was a communications strategist at the D.C. public affairs firm Berman and Company, where he also worked as a spokesperson for the Employment Policies Institute, which put out this highly misleading ACORN attack ad. ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, advocated for the poor, helped families navigate federal aid programs and registered people to vote \u2014 until it was brought down by Republican strategists like Miller, working alongside less respectable ratfuckers like James O\u2019Keefe of Project Veritas. According to ProPublica, the Employment Policies Institute also \u201cproduced numerous reports arguing that boosting the minimum wage hurts teen workers and frustrates job creation.\u201d The folks who write the white papers are just ratfuckers who carry briefcases.\n\nIn 2013, Miller helped co-found the GOP opposition group America Rising, a group that put out ads like this:\n\nMiller actively worked to paint Hillary Clinton as a lying thief and to terrify Americans into believing that the only thing standing between them and ISIS was a Republican president. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone that a professional smear man would, as the Times reported yesterday, casually talk about a willingness to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d regarding Facebook\u2019s egregious privacy issues. Plus, he still very much sees George W. Bush as a man of honor.\n\nTo a certain Beltway mindset, it is the height of seriousness not to take political ideas so seriously that you attach life-or-death significance to them. For the \u201cPod Save America\u201d hosts and for most of the other liberals eagerly embracing Never Trumpers, showing off your Republican pal \u2014 the good, polite kind of Republican! \u2014 feels harmless because most of them will never actually have to deal with the consequences of actual Republican policies.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-refuses-trump-racist-ad-don-jr_us_5bddbfe0e4b04367a87d05aa": "CNN on Saturday defended its decision not to air President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration ad, saying the spot was racist and not fit to broadcast.\n\nA tweet on the CNN Communications Twitter account responded to Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son who was upset CNN wouldn\u2019t show the ad, by saying the network \u201chas made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined,\u201d the tweet said.\n\nCNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist.

The Data Trust is an independent for-profit entity that houses all of the Republican Party\u2019s national and state-level voter information for use by presidential and congressional candidates and outside Republican groups.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Perez and his allies claim the DNC has a narrow window of time to replicate a Republican project that took years of investment. They want their own version of the Data Trust to be up and running before the Democratic presidential primaries start in earnest.\n\nOpposing them are an array state party chairs, officers and executive directors led by Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin, head of the Association of State Democratic Committees. They are concerned about forfeiting ownership of data they have collected to a group of technology professionals whose political judgment and integrity they are not confident in.\n\n\u201cWe all have the same outcome in mind, which is winning elections and making sure we get Trump out of there,\u201d Martin told a private audience of state party leaders on a Monday afternoon call joined by HuffPost. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to figure this out, but it\u2019s not going to be done on the backs of state parties, and it\u2019s not going to be done by putting us out of business.\u201d\n\nCurrently, state-level Democratic parties own the voter data through a voter file co-operative managed by TargetSmart, a private data management firm. The parties share the data with the DNC, which operates the software through which users access the data. Campaigns use the information for such things as how to decide where candidates should campaign and what messages they should emphasize, to predict how different constituencies will react to certain issues and to complement traditional polls of the race.\n\nBut a key gap in the Democratic system is the inability of outside groups to access and input data in real time instead of after its collection.\n\n\u201cIt is also time to take critical steps to modernize our data infrastructure,\u201d Perez wrote in an email to state party chairs Saturday. \u201cThe other side has already done this, so time is of the essence. If we want to continue to win elections, this modernization is an imperative.\u201d\n\nThe resistant state party chairs insist, however, that the current co-op system can be upgraded to accommodate this change without adopting a whole new system.\n\n\u201cWe can change the current system to see the data in real time,\u201d said Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb. \u201cMy problem is turning over decades of work to a group of consultants who are not on the ground and who are not accountable to a whole state infrastructure that has lived before us and will live on well after us.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody is screaming that there is a problem because we can\u2019t trade information, or process information in real time from special interest groups,\u201d said Trav Robertson, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. \u201cThat\u2019s true! If that\u2019s something that we need to do, then, by God, we need to figure out a way to do it.\u201d\n\nMy problem is turning over decades of work to a group of consultants who are not on the ground and who are not accountable to a whole state infrastructure that has lived before us and will live on well after us. Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb\n\nWhat started as a technical dispute took a personal turn Saturday. Perez lambasted Martin and his allies in a blistering email to state party leaders that prompted the most vicious round yet of sniping in the press. DNC aides said Martin\u2019s counterproposal, sent out Friday, came as shock to Perez and other party officials, who thought negotiations were proceeding well.\n\nBut rather than cow him, Perez\u2019s email gave Martin a moral high ground to stand on as he tried to rally the troops behind him on Monday\u2019s call.\n\nMartin laid out a fallback plan if talks with the DNC continued to stall: Leave the DNC behind and raise funds to manage the voter data completely independently.\n\nThe mere threat of such action reflected an inherent leverage the state party chairs believe they have over Perez thanks to their possession of the data.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be going down that road, but if the DNC decides to end this historic partnership, then we as state parties have all the cards here,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMany state party leaders believe the fight is a matter of survival. The data they collect are the chief source of value they bring to the table when raising money for their operations and haggling over policy matters with the DNC. In the words of some operatives, the data are essentially their only asset.\n\n\u201cThe state parties don\u2019t have a lot that makes people need to pay attention to them,\u201d said one former state party operative, who requested anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cThey\u2019ve been systematically weakened over the past years. The reason presidential candidates show up to their Jefferson-Jackson dinner is because of the voter file.\u201d\n\nThe state party chairs\u2019 sensitivity to perceived encroachments on their crown jewel reflects a turbulent relationship with the national party dating to the Obama administration.\n\nPresident Barack Obama famously used his election data to create the separate organization Obama for America \u2015 later rebranded Organizing for Action \u2015 that critics across the ideological spectrum blame for diverting resources and energy from the DNC and the state parties with which it works.\n\nBy the time Hillary Clinton ran for president, she found the DNC bereft of cash and unprepared to take on the supportive role it would normally assume in a presidential year. The Clinton campaign effectively took over the DNC, using the state parties mainly as vehicles to funnel campaign cash upward to their central operation.\n\nThe race for the DNC chairmanship was an opportunity for many state party leaders to elect a DNC chairman more responsive to their needs. Many of them, including fellow Minnesotan Ken Martin, backed Rep. Keith Ellison\u2019s bid for the top post.\n\nBut thanks in part to the support of Obama \u2015 the very man accused of neglecting the DNC \u2015 Perez narrowly defeated Ellison.\n\nSince then, Perez pleased state party chairmen by upping their monthly stipend from the DNC from $7,500 to $10,000. But state party leaders are nervous about the status of DNC innovation grants for the coming year, and the DNC\u2019s fundraising has at times been lackluster.\n\nMike Shields, a former RNC chief of staff who helped develop its now-vaunted Data Trust, said it took masterful diplomacy for then-RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to align all stakeholders behind the project.\n\nShields did not have the same confidence in Perez\u2019s abilities. Referring to the DNC chairman\u2019s Saturday missive, Shields observed: \u201cYou only send an email like that if you are in a position of weakness.\u201d\n\nA new variable entered the already chaotic mix last week when LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman announced plans to invest $35 million into his own data storage entity \u2015 whether state party leaders can reach an agreement with Perez or not.\n\nThe Hoffman plan represents a threat to both the DNC and the state parties \u2015 a successful private effort could render both group\u2019s data work largely irrelevant. But it also makes for a useful talking point in the DNC\u2019s negotiations with the states.\n\n\u201cIf the party does not participate in something like this, it will happen without the party,\u201d one DNC staffer working on the data efforts told HuffPost.\n\nBut if Hoffman follows through on his plans, many Democrats worry about a repeat of the resource drain caused by OFA under Obama. Republicans have their own cautionary tale of an outside data operation depriving them of adequate partisan control.\n\nSeveral years before the Data Trust was up and running, the conservative billionaire Koch brothers launched their own data collection operation, i360.\n\nThe libertarian-leaning Kochs do not march in lockstep with the RNC, however. For example, in the November midterm election, they declined to endorse the Republican candidate for Senate in North Dakota and even distributed positive campaign literature on behalf of Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who narrowly lost.\n\nYears before the Koch brothers\u2019 controversial role in North Dakota, Republicans foresaw the pitfalls of relying on an outside actor to administer party data, according to Shields. \u201cAny company or any billionaire who seems to agree with us but isn\u2019t accountable to the party structure ... and has their own agenda\u201d cannot substitute the role of the party itself, he said.\n\nThere is a dispute among Democratic operatives over just how far Republicans are ahead in the data wars \u2015 some insist the existence of such a gap is overstated, while others argue each party is ahead in certain areas. But most agree getting the data right is even more important for Democrats than it is for the GOP, which is a more monolithic party. Democrats often need to target multiple, diverse voting groups. And the party\u2019s data, digital and field operatives can\u2019t even agree on how to define its data problems.\n\nThe only certainty? No one expects the party to solve its data woes at Tuesday\u2019s meeting.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rep-steve-cohen-introduces-bills-to-get-rid-of-electoral-college-stop-presidents-self-pardoning_us_5c2f8d6ae4b0d468baa46075": "Democratic Rep.

Before being named acting attorney general, he was Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. The most logical replacement would have been the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe legitimacy of President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker has already been called into question, as he has so publicly criticized the very investigation he now oversees at the Department of Justice. CNN paid him $15,000 last year to opine on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into foreign interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign was involved.\n\nTaken together, these Whitaker opinions present what appears to be clear conflict of interest.

(AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan who later became Russia\u2019s leading defender on Capitol Hill and an outspoken advocate for legalized marijuana, was defeated Saturday, a victim of California\u2019s Democratic tilt and voters\u2019 distaste for President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher, 71, was defeated by real estate executive Harley Rouda, 56, a Republican-turned-Democrat who pilloried the congressman for his skepticism over climate change and depicted him as an out-of-touch abettor in Washington gridlock.\n\nWith votes continuing to be counted, Rouda\u2019s edge grew steadily. The vote count updated Saturday showed Rouda with 52 percent of the vote and about 8,500 more votes than Rohrabacher.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s ouster from his seat in Orange County has historical and symbolic significance. The county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon and long considered a foundational block in the modern conservative movement. Reagan himself likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nBut Democrats have picked off two GOP seats either all or partly in the county since Tuesday\u2019s election, and are threatening in two others. Democrat Mike Levin this week captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county.\n\nOrange County was once a Republican lock on Election Day, said Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science at Chapman University.\n\n\u201cTheir lock is over,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven GOP-held House districts in California this year that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, including Rohrabacher\u2019s 48th. They\u2019ve now won three of those seats, with the potential to pick up three more and pad their new majority in the House.\n\nDemocrat Katie Porter is inching closer to Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters in Orange County\u2019s 45th District. In the nearby 39th District held by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce his protege, Republican Young Kim, sees her lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros tightening.\n\nIn central California\u2019s farm belt, Democrat Josh Harder grabbed a nearly 2-point lead after a vote count update Friday after trailing Rep. Jeff Denham in the 10th District.\n\nFor state Republicans, Rohrabacher\u2019s defeat represents another stinging blow for a party that has seen its fortunes wither for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million advantage in voter registrations. With Rouda\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 42-11 edge in California U.S. House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have tumbled to third-party status in the state: they are even outnumbered by registered independents.\n\nBehind the shift: A surge in immigrants in recent decades transformed the state and its voting patterns. In Orange County, largely white, conservative homeowners once delivered winning margins for GOP candidates year after year. But most of the state\u2019s new voters, Hispanics and Asians, are Democrats or independents.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to discount the influence of Trump, who lost California by over 4 million votes in 2016. California is home to the so-called Trump \u201cresistance,\u201d which has stood in opposition to his policies on the environment and immigration.\n\nRohrabacher reflects the dramatic shift of fortunes in Orange County: He was re-elected by nearly 17 points just two years but met his end when Democrats backed a wealthy, pro-business moderate in Rouda.\n\nRohrabacher has long been an unusual figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe one-time Cold Warrior transformed into an outspoken supporter of improved ties with Russia, and his name has come up in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was heard on tape in 2016 saying Rohrabacher was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCarthy\u2019s office said the comments at a private meeting, disclosed by the Washington Post, were misconstrued and McCarthy was joking with colleagues.\n\nIn the campaign, Rohrabacher was faced with the prospect of making his Reagan-era conservative views appealing to newer voters, while holding college-educated Republican women who polls suggest are turned off by Trump.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-h-w-bush-last-president-to-get-tough-with-israel_us_5c06ac48e4b07aec5753418a": "Mark Reinstein/MediaPunch/IPx President George H.W. Bush insisted on a delay in loan guarantees to Israel until after a multilateral peace summit in Madrid, Spain, in October 1991.\n\nOne of George H.W. Bush\u2019s greatest accomplishments, a flurry of even-handed diplomacy that set the stage for the first direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, has received relatively little attention in the analysis of his legacy that followed his death on Saturday.\n\nAs part of his efforts, Bush threatened aid to Israel to nudge it in the direction of peace \u2014 making him the last American president to take such strong measures against the American ally. And, for a time at least, he got his way.\n\n\u201cBush\u2019s foreign policy legacy, especially on the issue of Israeli-Palestinian peace, cannot be overstated,\u201d said Daniel Kurtzer, a longtime U.S. diplomat who helped shape Bush\u2019s Middle East policy. \u201cHis willingness to be tough on all parties ... ushered in a period of intense diplomacy involving Israel and all of the Arab world.\u201d\n\nHad the United States government continued Bush\u2019s tough-love approach, rather than abandoning it, Kurtzer and other foreign policy veterans argue, the U.S. may have succeeded in brokering the kind of lasting peace deal that still eludes Israel and the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable that no Republican or Democratic president since has been willing to put meaningful pressure on Israel,\u201d said Khaled Elgindy, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Palestinian negotiators from 2004 to 2009. \u201cEven as they have learned what the peace process has required, they\u2019ve been less willing to do what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\n\u2018One Lonely Little Guy\u2019\n\nIn the wake of the first Gulf War, which ended in February 1991, then-President Bush was at the peak of his power on the global stage. He had successfully expelled the Iraqi military from Kuwait, a U.S. ally and major oil producer \u2015 all while managing to insulate Israel, almost entirely, from retaliation at the hands of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.\n\nBush decided that Arab-Israeli peace was next on his list of international accomplishments. To that end, his famously assertive Secretary of State Jim Baker laid the groundwork of what would become a multilateral peace conference in Madrid, Spain, in October 1991. Israel and a host of Arab governments sat down, under American supervision, to discuss their thorniest differences, chief among them, the status of the Palestinian people.\n\nIn a nod to Israel, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, a militant political organization that represented the Palestinian national cause, was not present. Instead, Palestinian representatives participated as part of the Jordanian delegation.\n\nNo other president has either acted affirmatively or reactively in dealing with things we don\u2019t agree with when Israel does them. Daniel Kurtzer, former U.S. ambassador to Israel\n\nBut a few weeks before the conference, the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir asked the United States to guarantee $10 billion in loans Israel needed to help absorb hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the Soviet Union. Under the arrangement, the U.S. would have served as Israel\u2019s guarantor with creditors, assuring it a much lower interest rate than it would have otherwise received in the credit markets.\n\nThe United States had already guaranteed a $400 million loan to Israel to absorb a smaller wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants in October 1990.\n\nAt the time, Baker had negotiated strong assurances from Israel that it would not use the funds to relocate the Jewish immigrants to settlements in the territories Israel occupied since 1967, which the U.S. viewed \u2015 and, at least officially, continued to view for decades \u2015 as a major impediment to peace.\n\nWhen the U.S. sought to impose the same terms to the new tranche of loans, however, Shamir objected.\n\nBush stood his ground, insisting on delaying the entire loan guarantee for 120 days. He claimed he did not want a protracted debate with Congress over settlements to interfere with the peace talks; he likely also wanted to pressure a wayward Shamir into cooperating with the conference and burnish American credibility as a fair mediator with Arab nations.\n\nShamir thought that with the help of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, he could force Bush\u2019s hand by mobilizing Congress to approve the aid immediately in defiance of the president.\n\nUnmoved, Bush vowed to veto legislation that authorized the aid before the 120-day delay had expired. He took his case to the media, speaking at length about his stance in a press conference on Sep. 12, 1991. He famously portrayed himself as an underdog against the might of AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups, which had recently organized a massive lobbying day on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI heard today there was something like 1,000 lobbyists on the Hill working on the other side of the question. We\u2019ve got one lonely little guy down here doing it,\u201d he said, eliciting laughs from the White House press corps.\n\nShortly thereafter, Bush prevailed in his game of chicken with Shamir and AIPAC.\n\nCongress backed down. And when the U.S. finally guaranteed the loans in the spring of 1992, it did so using a new formula designed to offset Israel\u2019s spending on settlements. It guaranteed $200 million less for each billion Israel asked for to account for Israel\u2019s projected settlement spending.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, left, confers with his Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Madrid peace conference in October 1991.\n\nThe Madrid conference, and the multilateral talks that followed, did not result in any breakthroughs between Israel and its neighboring Arab nations, to say nothing of the occupied Palestinians.\n\nBut the shortcomings of the conference solidified a realization within Israel\u2019s peace camp that Israel would need to conduct direct talks with PLO leaders, who had not been present in Madrid.\n\nAnd perhaps more significantly, the drama over the loan guarantees hastened Shamir\u2019s political demise. He lost his bid for re-election in June 1992 due, at least in part, to public weariness of the tensions his conduct had created with the United States, Israel\u2019s major military, financial and diplomatic benefactor.\n\nShamir\u2019s successor, Yitzhak Rabin of the center-left Labor party, went on to give his blessing to the first direct Israeli talks with PLO leaders that were initially undertaken in secret in Oslo, Norway. The discussions led to the Oslo Accords, which created a degree of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza that was meant to serve as the basis for future Palestinian sovereignty.\n\nViewed from that angle, Bush\u2019s showdown with Shamir served as a model for the success an American president is capable of achieving in the region if she or he is determined enough to withstand short-term political blowback.\n\nIt also revealed dissension within Jewish American ranks that AIPAC\u2019s strength had long masked.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time the pro-Israel lobby started to splinter,\u201d said Dov Waxman, a political science professor at Northeastern University and author of Trouble in the Tribe: The American Jewish Conflict Over Israel.\n\nAmericans for Peace Now, a pro-peace group, backed Bush\u2019s stance. Its divergence with AIPAC presaged the creation of more sophisticated liberal Jewish advocacy organizations like J Street, which rose to prominence more than a decade later. Those groups provided politically valuable Jewish support for the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran in 2015.\n\nBFMTV Former President Barack Obama, right, had a famously frosty relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he never leveraged U.S. aid to force Israeli concessions.\n\nThe Last Of His Kind?\n\nBut if Bush\u2019s tough-love approach set a high-water mark for the potential power of the United States to play the honest broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, his re-election loss in 1992 deprived him of the opportunity to follow through on it. And his successors\u2019 unwillingness \u2015 or inability \u2015 to show the same resolve contributed to the American failure to bring peace in the region.\n\n\u201cNo other president has either acted affirmatively or reactively in dealing with things we don\u2019t agree with when Israel does them,\u201d said Kurtzer, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Egypt under Bill Clinton and U.S. Ambassador to Israel under George W. Bush.\n\nNeither Clinton, nor George W. Bush, nor Barack Obama emulated Bush\u2019s approach of tying American aid to stopping settlement growth.\n\nThe result was an explosion of settlement construction that continues to place a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict further from reach. Even during the optimistic aftermath of the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, Jewish settlements in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories skyrocketed.\n\nThere are now about 600,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, raising the political price of the kind of withdrawal that would be necessary to allow the creation of a geographically contiguous Palestinian state on those lands.\n\n\u201cIf you are settling, colonizing territory at the very same moment you are supposedly part of a peace process aimed at giving it away in exchange for peace, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u201d Elgindy said.\n\nIsrael has its own grievances with Palestinians. Israeli governments have consistently argued that Palestinian incitement and violence against Jews are the reason for its heavy-handed policing and settlement of the West Bank, rather than a result of it. Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians was especially deadly during the Second Intifada from 2000 to 2005, when Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks killed more than 700 Israeli civilians.\n\nThe difference, however, is that American leaders are willing to exercise pressure on Palestinian leaders that they have proven incapable of exercising on the Israeli side.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-michael-flynn-robert-mueller_us_5c084e4ee4b0844cda4fa488": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Former national security adviser Michael Flynn met with federal prosecutors on 19 occasions to help their various probes into possible connections between Russian officials and Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated praise for his first national security adviser as a good man who was treated badly by prosecutors appears to have ended, now that special counsel Robert Mueller is praising him.\n\nMueller revealed Tuesday night that he is recommending that retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn serve no jail time because of his \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d in various investigations regarding Trump and his dealings with Russia.\n\nJust a day earlier, Trump lauded a former business and campaign adviser for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors: \u201cNice to know that some people still have \u2018guts!\u2019\u201d he wrote on Twitter about Roger Stone.\n\nYet by late Wednesday, Trump still had not weighed in on revelations that Flynn met with federal prosecutors on 19 occasions to help their various probes \u2014 including two that are not known publicly and whose details were blacked out in Mueller\u2019s court filings.\n\nTrump\u2019s outside lawyer handling his criminal investigations, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, told HuffPost on Wednesday that there is no reason for Trump to attack Flynn because it does not appear that Flynn has given Mueller anything incriminating on Trump. \u201cThe president is confident that the general is telling the truth,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication of any connection to the president. They\u2019ve produced nothing on that.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said that if Flynn was actually an important witness against Trump, Mueller would not be letting sentencing go forward for fear of losing his leverage. Giuliani said he did not know what investigations were covered by all the redacted material in Tuesday\u2019s filings but said he doubted they had anything to do with Trump. \u201cHe may have other things he\u2019s cooperating about,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nTrump\u2019s silence thus far comes in stark contrast to his reaction last week to a guilty plea by his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a weak person and not a very smart person,\u201d Trump said the following morning. \u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to do is end \u2015 and it\u2019s very simple. He\u2019s got himself a big prison sentence, and he\u2019s trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story.\u201d\n\nTrump appointed Flynn to run his National Security Council despite warnings from outgoing President Barack Obama about Flynn, whom Obama fired from a top Pentagon post. Trump wound up firing Flynn after less than a month on the job. The dismissal came 18 days after then\u2013acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the White House that Flynn had lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the transition.\n\nTrump claimed he had to fire Flynn because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence and because of negative press coverage. \u201cI think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media \u2014 as I call it, the fake media \u2014 in many cases. And I think it\u2019s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly,\u201d Trump said during a Feb. 15, 2017, news conference.\n\nThat praise continued for a year and a half.\n\n\u201cThis man has served for many years. He\u2019s a general. In my opinion, he\u2019s a very good person,\u201d Trump said in a May 11, 2017 interview with NBC News.\n\nEven the day after Flynn pleaded guilty a year ago to lying to investigators, Trump continued to blame prosecutors. \u201cIt is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d the president wrote in a Dec. 2, 2017, tweet.\n\nAnd early this summer, Trump told reporters that perhaps Flynn was coerced into pleading guilty and had not lied to investigators at all. \u201cI feel badly for General Flynn. He\u2019s lost his house, he\u2019s lost his life. And some people say he lied and some people say he didn\u2019t lie. I mean, really, it turned out maybe he didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFlynn is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 18. Prosecutors are set to file recommendations this week for sentences for Cohen from an earlier guilty plea and for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort from his September guilty pleas on fraud and obstruction of justice charges.\n\nThe FBI has been investigating Trump and his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia since before his election. He openly praised the country\u2019s authoritarian ruler throughout his campaign, and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spy agencies worked to elect Trump by stealing emails from Democrats and releasing them through an ally, WikiLeaks. Trump repeatedly praised WikiLeaks and pointed to the stolen emails as proof that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was corrupt.\n\nTrump fired FBI Director James Comey not long after taking office and told first Russian diplomats visiting the Oval Office and then NBC News that he had done so because of the Russia investigation. Mueller, who served as FBI director under Presidents George W.

Investigators are probing reports that a political operative working for Republicans ran an illegal ballot operation in the 9th District.\n\nA spokesman for Higdon\u2019s office said Monday they \u201ccannot confirm or deny any investigation\u201d into the alleged wrongdoings in the race between Harris and McCready.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office Robert Higdon Jr. is seen in an undated photo.\n\nState investigators in North Carolina, however, indicated they are working with the FBI and Higdon\u2019s office on the investigation into the alleged election improprieties. The Washington Post reported that Harris\u2019 28-year-old son John is an assistant U.S. attorney working under Higdon.\n\nNew evidence came to light Monday connecting suspicious absentee ballot activity in the Harris-McCready race to a political operative named Leslie McCrae Dowless. Dowless has a criminal history and has emerged at the center of the possible election fraud case. The conduct in question allegedly took place in Bladen County, which falls within the federal judicial Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\nHigdon, who co-led the prosecution of former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) in a case involving campaign finance fraud, has more recently overseen the prosecution of a number of cases of voting by noncitizens. One conviction in that batch of cases, involving an Italian immigrant who\u2019d registered as a Republican, resulted in a $200 fine. Former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias, who was fired during the George W. Bush administration after Republicans complained that he failed to bring enough voter fraud cases, told HuffPost that the episode was an example of \u201cthe type of de minimis case\u201d \u2015 that is, a case too minor to merit consideration \u2015 \u201cthat U.S. Attorneys almost never prosecute.\u201d\n\nHigdon\u2019s office also issued a broad subpoena request earlier this year for millions of voter registration applications and absentee ballots, which the North Carolina Board of Elections voted to quash. Under scrutiny, Higdon\u2019s office delayed the subpoenas until after November\u2019s election.\n\nElection officials are now investigating apparent irregularities with absentee ballots in the midterm race. In Bladen County, there appear to be an unusually high number of voters who requested ballots but never returned them. Bladen County is the only place in the district where Harris defeated McCready in absentee ballots.\n\nThe state Democratic Party submitted an affidavit from a man named Dwight Sheppard, who said he overheard a group of people saying Dowless would receive a $40,000 bonus if Harris won the race. In another affidavit, a man said he spoke to Dowless outside an early voting location earlier this year, and says Dowless told him he was doing absentee work for Harris.\n\nDowless was convicted of felony perjury and felony fraud in 1990 and 1992 respectively, according to The Charlotte Observer. He\u2019s worked on get-out-the-vote operations for a number of candidates over the last decade. As described in a 2016 episode of \u201cThis American Life,\u201d Dowless was at one point accused of running an illegal scheme that involved collecting absentee ballot forms and casting them on other people\u2019s behalf. The \u201cvolunteers\u201d working with Dowless were allegedly paid per ballot, and the case was referred to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Higdon was confirmed as U.S. Attorney several months later, in September 2017.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Mark Harris speaks to the media on Nov. 7, 2018.\n\nWSOC, a local television station, made another connection between Dowless and the apparent irregularities in the 9th District. A woman told the station that she collected absentee ballots from voters and then gave them to Dowless. In North Carolina, only the voter or a \u201cclose relative\u201d can return a ballot. The woman, Ginger Eason, told the station she didn\u2019t know what Dowless did with the ballots.\n\nWSOC and the website Popular Information published the names of eight witnesses who signed a high number of absentee ballots (North Carolina requires two witnesses for an absentee ballot). Eason is among that group and signed as a witness for 10 people.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement voted 7-2 Friday to hold a public evidentiary hearing on or before Dec. 21. Andy Penry, a Democrat and the board\u2019s chairman, resigned over the weekend after Republicans drew attention to tweets he\u2019d written that were critical of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump speaks often of the need to crack down on supposed election irregularities, and has made the baseless claim that millions of votes from illegal immigrants gave former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton her popular vote victory over him in the 2016 election.

He insisted on air that nothing would come of it, that Mueller\u2019s budget should be capped, that Donald Trump Jr. was not in the wrong for meeting with a Russian lawyer to talk about Hillary Clinton and that investigating the Trump Organization\u2019s financial ties to Russia crossed a \u201cred line.\u201d\n\nIn a CNN editorial published earlier this month, Whitaker argued that Mueller\u2019s probe could become \u201ca mere witch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d Whitaker wrote.\n\nHe\u2019s friends with one of Mueller\u2019s grand jury witnesses.\n\nIn another conflict of interest, Whitaker has a close friendship with Sam Clovis, Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign co-chair who has testified before the grand jury in the Mueller investigation.\n\nClovis has said he and Whitaker became close when they ran against each other in a 2014 Senate primary campaign in Iowa.

He pulls 10-hour shifts, four days a week, at an IHS medical facility in Arizona. And starting Friday, because of the partial government shutdown, he will stop getting a paycheck.\n\nAnpetu Luta Hoksila, 35, doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to pay his bills. He plans to lean on his credit card, but that won\u2019t last long. He called his Toyota dealership to say he couldn\u2019t make his car payment, and it agreed to let him tack the payment onto the end of his loan term. Worst case scenario, if the shutdown drags on beyond next week, he said he\u2019s prepared to quit his job and work as a barista at a local coffee shop.\n\n\u201cOn some level, it\u2019s kind of pitiful. But I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Anpetu Luta Hoksila, who requested he be referred to by his given Indian name so he wouldn\u2019t get in trouble at work. \u201cGenerally people know, if you\u2019re up to date on current events, that this is fucked up, right?\u201d\n\nIHS health care providers all over the country are bracing for their first missed paychecks on Friday \u2015 and the reality that they have to keep working anyway. That\u2019s because employees like Anpetu Luta Hoksila are considered \u201cexcepted,\u201d meaning they won\u2019t get paid during the shutdown, but they are also considered \u201cessential\u201d because the care they provide is vital to IHS services. The agency provides health care to nearly 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through 45 hospitals and nearly 300 clinics in 35 states.\n\nHuffPost tried to get an exact number for how many IHS health care providers will stop getting paid this week but are still expected to work. An IHS spokesman, who was working despite being furloughed, said he is trying to track down that information.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know how severely the IHS funding freeze will hurt health care services to tribes. But it\u2019s already taking a toll. One urban IHS health care provider said morale has plummeted at her clinic in Michigan, where employees live paycheck to paycheck and are scared. A tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula is mulling its own furloughs and pared-back health services. A nonprofit based in Boston and Baltimore that contracts with IHS expects to run out of money this week, and is looking at layoffs and suspended medical and mental health services.\n\nThat IHS has even stopped sending money to tribes raises serious questions about the U.S. government not meeting its treaty obligations. The federal government is obligated to provide health care services to tribes because of treaties negotiated generations ago in exchange for huge swaths of land. IHS is funded by the Interior appropriations bill, though it is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. As long as IHS funding is cut off, the government appears to be in violation of tribes\u2019 treaty rights.\n\n\u201cIn a roundabout way, they can say they are providing care. But the people that provide the health care are not getting paid to do so,\u201d said one nurse practitioner who works at an IHS medical facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely.\n\n\u201cWe have psychologists, psychiatrists, a plethora of people who provide care,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey can only maintain working without pay for a certain period. People will start dropping out. They\u2019re going to have to find another job because they can\u2019t pay rent. I have enough for two months. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Dr. LeeAnna Muzquiz of Ronan Tribal Health examines Mary Parker during a checkup in Ronan, Montana.\n\nSeveral of the health care providers who talked to HuffPost said the shutdown marks another chapter in the government\u2019s abysmal treatment of tribes. Native Americans suffer from many illnesses and diseases at rates several times higher than the overall U.S. population. IHS also has a long history of being underfunded. And the same federal policies that led to the creation of IHS \u2015 disenfranchising marginalized and indigenous people \u2015 are driving President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence on building a wall along the border.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re depressing our ability to provide health care to indigenous people while also trying to keep indigenous people out,\u201d said Anpetu Luta Hoksila, who is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, I\u2019m a brown person trying to serve brown people while we\u2019re also trying to cause harm to other brown people. On a number of levels, it\u2019s really fucked up. That\u2019s the only way I can put it.\u201d\n\nDr. James McAuley, the clinical director of Whiteriver Indian Hospital in Arizona, said he expects his staff of about 40 nurses and physicians to work without pay for as long as they can because people in health care \u201care generally altruistic.\u201d But he is bracing for low morale and stories of financial hardship. His hospital is on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and serves about 17,000 Native Americans.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the public probably perceives physicians won\u2019t suffer. But we have young people just out of residency, with big student loans \u2015 they\u2019ll have to make deferrals on those,\u201d said McAuley. \u201cMore worrisome is what happens with support staff, who are making far less and supporting family members.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think our local churches are anticipating a need to step in,\u201d he added.\n\nSmall tribes in rural areas will be hit the hardest by the IHS funding freeze. Some rely entirely on federal funding for all of their services, and others don\u2019t have a single clinic on their reservation. That requires people to commute, sometimes an hour or more, to a remote IHS facility that will now be struggling to operate because of the government shutdown.\n\nI\u2019m a brown person trying to serve brown people while we\u2019re also trying to cause harm to other brown people. On a number of levels, it\u2019s really fucked up. Dr. Anpetu Luta Hoksila\n\nMonica Brady, the finance director for the Yomba Shoshone Tribe in northern Nevada, said that\u2019s the situation with this tribe. It doesn\u2019t have a clinic or generate its own income. Members of the community rely heavily on public transportation to get to their medical appointments.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest concern: We need these programs back up and running to transport our elders to and from their appointments,\u201d said Brady, who expressed frustration that there hasn\u2019t been more news coverage of the shutdown\u2019s effects on rural tribes. \u201cDo people realize that not every reservation in the nation has a casino?\u201d\n\nBrady, whose husband is a member of the tribe, was the only person in the tribe\u2019s administrative office when HuffPost called. It usually has 22 people in it. But she and all of her colleagues have been furloughed, and many are applying for unemployment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just muddling along until we know what we can do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure I\u2019m here a few days a week, just to make sure someone is answering any calls.\u201d\n\nPaulette Jordan, a former Democratic candidate for governor and two-term state legislator, is a member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe in rural Idaho. She said her tribe\u2019s health care services are fine for now because it relies less on federal money than some other tribes. But she\u2019s worried about what a prolonged shutdown could mean.\n\n\u201cWe live in health care deserts,\u201d she said. \u201cIf our health clinics close up shop on reservations in rural communities, it poses a major threat to Native people who have been subject to governmental genocide for generations and are now left with increased demands for urgent and chronic care.\u201d\n\nChuck Hoskin's Facebook page Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin said his tribe can weather the effects of the U.S. government shutdown for now. But not for too long.\n\nBigger tribes that generate significant money from casinos, like the Cherokee Nation, can pull from their general fund and get by for a longer period. The Cherokee Nation manages its own major hospital and eight health centers, and blends its own money with IHS money.\n\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019re able to protect the Cherokee people,\u201d said Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin. \u201cNot all tribes in the country are so blessed. We need to remember that. But even as strong as Cherokee Nation is, we\u2019re not invulnerable to the effects of a long-term shutdown.\u201d\n\nHoskin lamented that Congress has failed to carry out the most basic responsibilities of government, like balancing a budget and funding the government. It\u2019s bad for the country, No. 1, he said, and it\u2019s bad for tribes.\n\nDespite Hoskin\u2019s reassurances, some of his tribe\u2019s members are scared about what the shutdown could mean for ailing family members. Amanda Clinton, his spokeswoman, tweeted that she\u2019s afraid the freeze in IHS funding could affect care for her father, who began undergoing chemo to treat cancer.\n\nMy dad recently began chemo for lymphoma. We just found out he may also have congestive heart failure. Because @IHSgov is stupidly under @Interior & they\u2019re #shutdown, can we stop talking about trash at parks & start talking about how ppl like my dad could die if this continues? \u2014 Amanda \u2668\ufe0f (@Amanda_Clinton) January 5, 2019\n\nFor the moment, there are no signs of a deal for fully reopening the federal government. Trump and Democratic leaders continue to clash on the president\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion to build his wall along the Mexican border.\n\nIn the meantime, for tribal health care providers trying to hang on without pay, it makes an already infuriating situation even worse when the president claims that affected workers support keeping the government closed until he gets his wall money.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear Trump say something like, \u2018100 percent of federal workers not receiving a paycheck agree with my stance that we should have a resolution for wall funding,\u2019 it really bothers me,\u201d said Anpetu Luta Hoksila. \u201cBecause here we are, unfunded without a resolution for our budget appropriations for this year, and it kills me to hear that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your fucking wall and I want to get paid for my work,\u201d he added.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-trump-cohen-92-y_us_5c0dc4e6e4b035a7bf5c73c0": "James Comey, the former director of the FBI, speculated Sunday that if President Donald Trump weren\u2019t the leader of the country he\u2019d be \u201cin serious jeopardy of being charged\u201d as part of the government\u2019s sweeping indictments of the lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nDuring a conversation with MSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace at the 92nd Street Y on Sunday evening, Comey spoke about his time in the White House, his newfound status as a perpetual target of Trump\u2019s Twitter tirades and his thoughts on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cBob Mueller and his team have done this like pros,\u201d Comey said, noting that someone once said the special counsel was \u201can olympic swimmer and we\u2019re dog paddlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that that\u2019s true,\u201d the former director continued.\n\nThe talk began with Comey discussing his thoughts on Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and longtime fixer.

But if the same people buying ads for the Trump campaign are also placing the NRA\u2019s pro-Trump ads, then the NRA\u2019s spending is not at all independent,\u201d Brendan Fischer of CLC said in a statement.\n\nThe NRA spent $36 million to influence the presidential election by attacking Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and supporting Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nWith so much gun manufacturer money behind him, the president rarely addresses the role guns play in the increasing number of mass shootings in the nation. In fact, he consistently urges that more people be armed, including teachers at schools. He suggested armed guards patrol synagogues after the mass shooting in October at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh."}
