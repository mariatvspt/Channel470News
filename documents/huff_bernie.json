{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-bureaucratic-coup-trump_n_5c6a69c7e4b033a79943feaa": "Sen.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-mccabe-trump-russia-putin_n_5c6a0de4e4b033a79943bd2b": "Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe \ufeffmade a series of startling allegations during a sweeping interview with \u201960 Minutes\u2019 that aired Sunday, including claims that President Donald Trump\ufeff took advice from Russian President Vladimir Putin over the counsel of his own intelligence chiefs.\n\nSpeaking with host Scott Pelley, McCabe, who was fired last March just two days before his retirement, alleged that Trump regularly launched into unprompted diatribes about his fondness for Russia.\n\nIn one instance, McCabe claimed, Trump said he didn\u2019t believe North Korea had the capability to launch a missile at the United States because Putin had told him so.

But for most people, Warren and Sanders hail from the same left flank of the Democratic Party \u2015 both are supporters of enacting Medicare for all, breaking up the banks and dramatically increasing taxes on the very wealthy.\n\nAnd yet in liberal and left-wing political discourse, the idea that Sanders and Warren are philosophical companions has become unfashionable. Jacobin, The New Republic, Splinter, BuzzFeed, The Week and The Guardian have all emphasized the supposedly critical ideological distinction between the two candidates: Sanders is an avowed socialist, while Warren wants to reform capitalism.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the next president takes office, they will likely face intense pressure from powerful interests, especially big business,\u201d writes Zaid Jilani. \u201cThe choice between Warren and Sanders may very well determine if that president confronts those interests with careful reasoning and principled advocacy or the force of a mass movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two senators disagree over the best method to give the working classes a leg up,\u201d according to David Dayen. \u201cYou can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option.\u201d For Jacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara, Warren aims at \u201cseeking to construct better policy but not an alternative politics,\u201d rejecting \u201cthe class-struggle, worker-centric approach of Sanders.\u201d\n\nFor once, the big-brain intellectuals have it wrong, and the delusional, selfish plutocrats are right.

And Sanders never slogged through troves of household bankruptcy data looking for the most common sources of middle-class financial strain. There are real differences between the two candidates (technically Bernie hasn\u2019t announced yet). But these are differences of temperament, style and strategy. Sanders and Warren, in fact, see the world in very similar ways.\n\nThe trouble for leftish intellectuals is a confusion over the terms \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201ccapitalism.\u201d Both words are extremely flexible, and their meanings shift with political currents. In an American context, it has never been easy to distinguish between socialism and reformed capitalism \u2015 and committed capitalists have denounced both with vigor. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was condemned as a socialist by congressional Republicans. In the 1940s, American conservatives viewed the social safety net in Britain and the Stalinist Soviet Union with almost equal alarm. By the 1950s, Herbert Hoover had concluded that the words \u201cliberalism\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d really just meant the same thing.\n\nSo, yes, Bernie Sanders has long been a champion of labor movements, protest marches and democratic socialism, while Elizabeth Warren is an academic wonk who talks about restoring competition to markets and making capitalism more accountable. But when it comes to their most detailed policies to date, both support an array of trust-busting, tougher regulation, wealth redistribution, public options and, where appropriate, nationalization.\n\nIt depends on the problem they\u2019re trying to solve. In practice, they end up supporting an awful lot of the same solutions. In addition to Medicare for all, breaking up the banks and taxing the rich, both Warren and Sanders are advocates of a federal job guarantee, postal banking and a bill making it easier for workers to unionize.\n\nAll of these proposals transfer money and power from the super-rich to the not-rich. Take postal banking. About 32.6 million households rely on a check-cashing service, payday lender or other expensive, small-dollar financial bottom-feeder at least once a year, according to the FDIC. On average, these households earn about $25,500 a year and spend nearly 10 percent of their income \u2015 $2,412 \u2015 on these sketchy financial products. That\u2019s over $82 billion going from hard-up homes to predators every year. You can deal with payday lenders a lot of different ways: ban them, regulate them or, the preferred tack of Warren and Sanders, have the government make them obsolete. If every household can get a low-fee bank account with the Post Office, they won\u2019t have to turn to legalized loan sharking to get by. That\u2019s bad news for payday loan executives, like ACE Cash Express CEO Jay Shipowitz, who made almost $4.5 million in 2004 alone. Is postal banking socialism or reformed capitalism? Yes.\n\nIn America today, the super-rich not only control an outrageous share of the national wealth, they also exercise a degree of political power incompatible with basic democratic principles. The choice for Democrats in 2020 is not really about policy minutia \u2015 it\u2019s about power \u2015 who has it, and who doesn\u2019t. And both Sanders and Warren have proved they are willing to confront the powerful and attack their sources of power. We can call this socialism, New Deal liberalism or Jeffersonian democracy \u2015 whatever the label, it\u2019s a critical ideological test for anyone who wants to be the next president of the United States.\n\nRunning for re-election in 1936, FDR noted that the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d of \u201cbusiness and financial monopoly, speculation\u201d and \u201creckless banking\u201d all counted themselves among his political \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me \u2015 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deluaro-schakowsky-medicare-for-america-all_n_5c672cc6e4b05c889d1f4bc9": "Rosa DeLauro has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives since 1991, which means she was there when Democrats tried to pass comprehensive health care legislation \u2015 first unsuccessfully, when Bill Clinton was president, and then successfully, when it was Barack Obama\u2019s turn. She took many lessons from those episodes, but one of the biggest was that threatening the insurance of people with good employer benefits is a terrible idea, no matter how appealing the new alternative sounds.\n\n\u201cThere are 160 million people who get their insurance through their employer,\u201d DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, told HuffPost recently. \u201cYou cannot tell them overnight that it is gone.\u201d\n\nLots of Democrats are making similar argument these days as proposals to create a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system get serious attention and scrutiny. The proposal getting the most attention right now comes from Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who made \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. House Democrats are working on a version of their own. Progressive supporters say the approach offers the most efficient way to make sure everybody can get affordable medical care \u2015 plus, they note, it would mean ending private insurance hassles once and for all.\n\nBut enrolling everybody into a government-run insurance plan would also mean wiping away employer-sponsored coverage, and the available polling, consistent with DeLauro\u2019s viewpoint, suggests the public would be wary. That is one reason even some Democrats who endorsed \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in the past are balking at committing to it now, while others are pushing explicitly to start much more slowly \u2015 perhaps by taking one of the two big existing programs, Medicare or Medicaid, and opening them up to carefully targeted groups of people. An example is a new bill from several Democratic senators that would let people older than 50 buy into Medicare.\n\nDeLauro, whose district includes some of the most liberal-leaning parts of New Haven, has bigger plans in mind. Along with another House Democrat, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, DeLauro has put together a proposal that envisions more dramatic reforms than those limited Medicare or Medicaid expansion proposals would launch, even though it would stop short of the kind of immediate, wholesale transformation that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would unleash.\n\nAlex Brandon/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) wants to create a government-run program open to everybody while allowing employers to keep offering benefits if they choose.\n\nThe legislation, which DeLauro and Schakowsky are calling \u201cMedicare for America,\u201d would create a comprehensive, government-run insurance program that would replace the big existing federal programs as well as the private insurance policies that people today buy on their own. But large employers would get to keep offering private coverage, leaving employees with the choice of sticking with their company plans or moving to the new public option, where they could potentially get much lower premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLike any health care initiative, the DeLauro-Schakowsky bill would entail real and complicated trade-offs. A skeptical take on the proposal is that it\u2019s just ambitious enough to carry the same political liabilities as something like the Sanders bill but not ambitious enough to carry its strengths. \u201cMedicare for America\u201d envisions less sweeping changes than \u201cMedicare for all\u201d does, but that could mean leaving in place more of the current system's waste and complexities.\n\nA more optimistic read on the \u201cMedicare for America\u201d bill is that it could create a stable, well-functioning universal coverage scheme \u2015 one that, with maybe a few adjustments, would offer Americans the kind of financial protection and convenience that many European systems do. The possibility might be enough to make the proposal an attractive landing spot for those Democrats who crave bold action but have qualms about \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\nSome Major Disruption, But Mostly For Half The Population\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d resembles some more skeletal proposals that have been in circulation for the past year or so \u2015 from analyst and Shadowproof contributor Jon Walker, Yale University political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Center for American Progress (CAP). Those last two are not coincidental: DeLauro and Schakowsky worked with Hacker and CAP experts as they crafted the bill, which the lawmakers introduced in December.\n\nThe CAP role might rankle those progressives who consider the think-tank too timid or protective of the Democratic Party establishment. But Walker is well-known on social media for his sharp progressive posts, while Hacker is famous for his role developing, and then fighting for, a strong public option in the Affordable Care Act. All of them have long records of supporting government-run insurance, as do DeLauro and Schakowsky.\n\nThat political pedigree may explain why, for all the talk about minimizing disruption, \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would actually disrupt quite a lot. For starters, it would automatically enroll everybody who does not have employer-sponsored insurance into the newly constructed government program. That\u2019s basically half the U.S. population, including people on Medicaid or Medicare as well as those who currently buy coverage on their own, whether directly from insurers or through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges.\n\nBryan Bedder via Getty Images Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker, who fought for a public option in the Affordable Care Act, advised the lawmakers writing the new \"Medicare for America\" bill.\n\nTransferring all of those people into a new government program is no small matter and something that proponents of major health care reforms (on the political right as well as the left) frequently overlook. Medicaid, in particular, has evolved considerably in its 50 years, as lawmakers have tacked on provisions in order to address the very specific needs of the program\u2019s vulnerable populations, including the disabled and the elderly. A proposal that simply dumped these groups into a regular insurance program could easily leave them struggling to pay for care and support.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d doesn\u2019t appear to have that problem. DeLauro and Schakowsky worked closely with representatives of the disability community, who now praise the bill for its attention to their needs and its potential to improve access to care rather than diminish it. They cite, among other things, the high standard of support for people who use home- and community-based services (everything from help with bathing to job counseling) in order to live independently and stay out of institutions.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first bill that considers long-term supports and services when it thinks about universal health care,\u201d Nicole Jorwic, director of rights policy at The Arc, an organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, told HuffPost.\n\nA Big Role For Private Insurance\n\nAs for the basic medical coverage, \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would provide an insurance package that looks a lot like what the Affordable Care Act is supposed to provide, except that benefits would come directly from the government and would be considerably more generous. The difference is particularly stark for people making up to twice the poverty line, or about $50,000 in annual income for a family of four, because they would pay virtually nothing.\n\nAbove that income threshold, premiums and out-of-pocket expenses would gradually become more substantial. And although they would still compare favorably with the standard policies available through the Affordable Care Act, this is where the really big differences between the DeLauro-Schakowsky and Sanders approaches start to emerge.\n\nIn the kind of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system that Sanders envisions, nobody would pay premiums and nobody would pay out-of-pocket costs, except for some token extra charges for people who buy brand-name drugs when cheaper, equivalent generics were available. This is a point of principle for progressives who think the financial burden of health care spending should be a collective responsibility exclusively (taxes finance the system) and who fear, with good reason, that high out-of-pocket spending penalizes the poor and sick.\n\nKaren Ducey via Getty Images Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) is putting together a new version of \"Medicare for all,\" a single-payer bill, and hopes to introduce it in the next few weeks.\n\nAnother conspicuous difference between \u201cMedicare for America\u201d and \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is the role of private insurance. \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would not only allow employers to keep offering private plans. It would also allow private insurers to keep offering so-called Medicare Advantage plans that roughly one-third of seniors now use instead of traditional Medicare \u2015 and it would allow insurers to offer those plans to non-seniors as well.\n\nProponents of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d think that allowing private insurers to maintain this foothold preserves some of the worst parts of today\u2019s health care system, in part because it means doctors and hospitals must still deal with multiple payers of services. One of the clearest benefits of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is that it would vastly simplify billing, allowing hospitals to cut administrative staff and ultimately save the system money.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d wouldn\u2019t do that, at least to the same degree. Nor would it sever completely the attachment between employment and coverage: As long as some businesses kept offering plans, employers would have some role in employee benefits. Plus, there are a lot of data to suggest that government overpays insurers that provide Medicare Advantage plans, allowing them to make extra profits at taxpayer expense.\n\nKeeping the private insurance industry in the driver\u2019s seat is simply too hazardous for our health care. Adam Gaffney, Physicians for a National Health Plan\n\n\u201cThe shenanigans and gaming of wasteful privatized Medicare plans have drained the public purse for decades,\u201d Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Plan, told HuffPost. \u201cThe excess administrative costs, and profits, imposed by our fragmented system produce hundreds of billions of dollars in waste. And patients are ill-served by narrow networks of providers, and by copays and deductibles, all of which would be retained under this plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeping the private insurance industry in the driver\u2019s seat is simply too hazardous for our health care,\u201d Gaffney said.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d supporters, by contrast, figure that most private plans from employers and through Medicare Advantage provide decent coverage \u2015 good enough, at least, that the political cost of forcing people to give up those plans isn\u2019t worth the potential upside. The key, they say, is using automatic enrollment at the workplace to make sure everybody really gets insurance, holding private plans to high standards, scrutinizing those Medicare Advantage plans more carefully and then making sure everybody has the opportunity to move into the public alternative \u2015 where premiums and out-of-pockets could end up being a lot lower because of the sliding income scale.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who collaborated with DeLauro on the \"Medicare for America\" bill, is a longtime advocate of government-run insurance.\n\nThis does not amount to a guarantee that people will get their current plans, as Obama infamously promised about the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s more like a vow to make sure everybody has access to coverage at least as good as most employer plans today \u2015 with an openly stated hope that a well-performing public plan would either force private insurers to keep up or force them to abandon the business.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who is frustrated with their private insurance, this plan would provide an immediate off-ramp,\u201d said Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at CAP. \u201cThe 150 million workers with employer coverage can move over at their own pace, whether they\u2019re fed up with their private insurance right now or prefer to wait until the Medicare plan is proven to work well. ... In other words, private insurance would no longer be a necessity.\u201d\n\nAs Charles Gaba, the Michigan-based analyst who runs ACAsignups.net, put it recently, the goal of \u201cMedicare for America\u201d is to make the new government program \u201cmandatory for roughly half the country (those least likely to object) but completely optional for the other half (those most likely to object).\u201d\n\nGovernment Control Of Prices, In A Roundabout Way\n\nA key ingredient in other nations\u2019 successful health care systems, which reformers in this country frequently cite as models, is government control of budgets and prices. That\u2019s why all of those countries are able to cover everybody with so much less money than the U.S. devotes to heath care.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d proposes to fix this by, in effect, setting a loose upper limit on doctor and hospital charges while allowing the government to negotiate drug and medical device prices. It\u2019s similar to the approach that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would take, but it would be less direct and less aggressive.\n\nWhere the Sanders proposal envisions paying hospitals at current Medicare rates, for example, the DeLauro-Schakowsky bill would establish a payment baseline that\u2019s 10 percent higher than Medicare\u2019s. That would still be less than commercial coverage, and the result would put some pressure on hospitals to lower prices, but not as much pressure as a proposal like the Sanders bill would apply.\n\nWithout that pressure, guaranteeing comprehensive benefits for so many people who don\u2019t have them would cost even more money. Exactly how much money is hard to say right now, and that is one reason it\u2019s difficult to predict with any confidence how many \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d the plan would produce.\n\nIf the DeLauro-Schakowsky proposal gets serious attention, influential groups, such as unions, will watch closely to see what it would mean for their members, many of whom have employer benefits more generous than what \u201cMedicare for America\u201d as presently written would guarantee. Groups representing the elderly citizens will be equally vigilant, checking to see how the new coverage and costs would compare to what seniors see once they are on Medicare.\n\nBut those questions don\u2019t need answers right away. With the new congressional session just starting, the presidential campaign still in its embryonic phase and opportunities to pass laws almost certainly two years away at least, bills and campaign proposals seem important primarily as markers politicians can use to signal their priorities and stake out early negotiating positions.\n\nFor anyone who is frustrated with their private insurance, this plan would provide an immediate off-ramp. Topher Spiro, Center for American Progress\n\nDeLauro and Schakowsky are now updating their bill and plan introduce the revision within the next few weeks, only this time with co-sponsors \u2015 and that should provide an interesting test of the concept\u2019s strength, because the latest version of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d will be making its debut in the House at around the same time.\n\nThe old House version of the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill got 124 co-sponsors. Aides to Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Washington state Democrat crafting its revision, have said their goal for now is merely to get more than 100 \u2015 a sign, perhaps, that finding co-sponsors is getting a little harder now that an endorsement is more than symbolic.\n\nAs it happens, one House Democrat who plans to sign on is Schakowsky, even though she also remains committed to promoting the bill she wrote with DeLauro. \u201cI will work towards passage of \u2018Medicare for America\u2019 in this Congress, as well as any other health reform proposals that improve health equity, access, and quality,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cWith a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, I am glad we can finally work on building upon the Affordable Care Act instead of fighting endless Republican attempts to tear it down.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-pharmaceutical_us_5c595a24e4b087104757204c": "Sen.

His Thursday announcement of what he\u2019s calling the For The 99.8% Act came just days after Republican senators announced they wanted to repeal the estate tax wholesale.\n\nSanders said the bill would raise $2.2 trillion from the more than 500 people who are billionaires in the U.S. at a time when Democratic contenders for president seem to be in a race to one-up each other with new ways of getting the rich to pay their fair share. Sanders is expected to announce his candidacy for 2020 soon.\n\n\u201cOur bill does what the American people want by substantially increasing the estate tax on the wealthiest families in this country and dramatically reducing wealth inequality,\u201d Sanders said in a press release. \u201cFrom a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders is introducing a bill to increase the estate tax on the nation's billionaires to a rate of 77 percent.\n\nRepublicans have railed against the estate tax for years, calling it the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d It was drastically lowered during the George W. Bush administration\u2015 even disappearing for a time in 2010 \u2015 and cut again with the most recent GOP tax overhaul. On Monday, GOP Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and John Thune (S.D.) introduced legislation that would go even further: permanently eliminating the federal estate tax altogether.\n\nCurrently, assets worth more than $11.4 million are taxed at a maximum rate of 40 percent. As recently as 1976, the tax rate was 77 percent on assets of $10 million in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nSanders would like to get back there: Under his plan, estates between $3.5 million and $10 million would be taxed at 45 percent. After that, the tax rate would increase to 50 percent for assets of $10 million to $50 million and to 55 percent for assets between $50 million and $1 billion.\n\nAny assets above that would be taxed at a rate of 77 percent. Sanders said the bill would affect the richest 0.2 percent of earners.\n\nHis proposal is just the latest tax-the-rich idea coming from Democrats this year. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has announced a 2020 presidential run, has proposed an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on people with more than $50 million in assets \u2015 that\u2019s a levy the wealthy would pay while they\u2019re still living. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has said she wants to raise the top marginal tax rate on incomes over $10 million.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, the US led the world toward the development of progressive taxation and the reduction of inequality at the global level during the first half of the 20th century,\u201d Thomas Piketty, an economist known for his work on wealth inequality, told HuffPost in an email about Warren\u2019s proposal. \u201cUnfortunately, one century later, in 2019, the rise of inequality creates new threats to liberal democracies. It is time to take a new step and to develop new policy instruments, in line with the challenges raised by global wealth trends. \u201c\n\nOcasio-Cortez has also taken a moral stand against the existence of billionaires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that Bill Gates or Warren Buffett are immoral, but a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don\u2019t have access to public health is wrong,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nAs wealth concentration is surging in the United States, it is high time to revive the estate tax, plug the loopholes, and make it more progressive. Emmanuel Saez, a supporter of Sanders' estate tax proposal\n\nHoward Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO who is now mulling a run for president as an independent candidate, has taken on the duty of publicly defending his fellow billionaires from political attacks. At a Monday event in Manhattan, he called Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s recent criticism of billionaires \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cmisinformed.\u201d Then on Tuesday, he described Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018ridiculous,\u2019\u201d Warren responded, \u201cis billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 proposal also would get rid of some of the tax shelters and dodges that the wealthy use to get out of paying the estate tax. That move echoes policy proposals from Warren and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Each has included reforms to estate tax loopholes as funding mechanisms for other legislative proposals.\n\nFiguring out how to raise taxes on the rich is shaping up to be one of the core pieces of the Democratic primary, said Greg Leiserson, director of tax policy and senior economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. He\u2019s agnostic so far on the method, though. Any of the proposals could work, he said, adding: \u201cI think we should be taxing wealth more and I\u2019m excited to see these different approaches.\u201d\n\nSanders said his act already has the approval of economists including Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Robert Reich.\n\n\u201cAs wealth concentration is surging in the United States, it is high time to revive the estate tax, plug the loopholes, and make it more progressive.

Scott Applewhite Sen. Bernie Sanders has yet to decide whether he will run for president in 2020.\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. \u2015 Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held over 400 house parties in all 50 states and Puerto Rico on Saturday afternoon calling on Sanders to run for president again in 2020.\n\nSanders maintains that he is still considering whether he is the best person to defeat President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s show of force, arranged by Organizing for Bernie \u2015 an upstart group founded by Sanders campaign alumni and grassroots activists \u2015 demonstrated one of the senator\u2019s biggest advantages if he decides to return to the ring: a network of supporters already familiar with his message and skilled in do-it-yourself internet organizing.\n\nSpeaking to the house parties by livestream, Kat Brezler, a Bronx public school teacher and co-founder of the group People for Bernie, called on the participants to use social media to show Sanders the scale of his support with the hashtag RunBernieRun.\n\n\u201cWe need to convince Bernie Sanders to run. He isn\u2019t in this race yet,\u201d Brezler said.\n\nEmphasizing the policy stakes of Sanders\u2019 bid, Brezler added, \u201cWe need \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 we need tuition-free college and we need to abolish [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], end mass incarceration, [enact national marijuana] legalization and all of the other reasons why we come to this movement.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sanders and his campaign team were not directly involved in Saturday\u2019s events, the house parties were co-sponsored by People for Bernie and Our Revolution, the latter group created to carry on the mission of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign.\n\nThe livestream, which was broadcast by progressive media upstart Act.tv, had attracted over 100,000 views as of Saturday evening.\n\nThe broadcast aimed to push back against a narrative developing in the media that Sanders would have difficulty retaining his 2016 staff, as well as to pre-emptively refute questions about the diversity of his staff and surrogates in a hypothetical 2020 run. In addition to Brezler, the speakers included Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, and RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director of National Nurses United. The discussion also featured contributions from Roy Tatem, the former deputy director of Sanders\u2019 2016 African-American outreach; Cori Bush, an African-American nurse and former progressive congressional candidate; and Bel\u00e9n Sisa, an undocumented immigrant activist and former member of Sanders\u2019 Latino outreach team.\n\nTatem, president of the East Valley NAACP in metropolitan Phoenix, argued that a second Sanders campaign would have greater success in reaching the middle-aged and older voters of color who proved so elusive for Sanders in 2016. The senator would no longer struggle to merely establish name recognition with these voters and inform them about his progressive platform, according to Tatem.\n\n\u201cNow everybody knows who Bernie Sanders is and about his program for free college, health care for all and actually dealing with police violence,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage people to take a look at our racial justice platform in 2016. I\u2019m hoping that we have a campaign so we can really talk about [that].\u201d\n\nAs Sanders, 77, deliberates whether to toss his hat in the presidential ring, other Democratic candidates are rapidly jumping into the race.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who would very likely be the field\u2019s second-most progressive contender after Sanders, announced her bid on New Year\u2019s Eve. Rep.

And former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro launched his campaign on Saturday.\n\nEven though Bernie has not announced yet, the opposition certainly has. RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director for National Nurses United\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders is undergoing scrutiny for complaints that senior figures in his 2016 campaign did not appropriately deal with sexual harassment among campaign staff. Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that some former staffers wanted an opportunity to confront Sanders about the lack of attentiveness to harassment issues, as well as alleged gender pay disparities among the staff. On Thursday, Politico also revealed that Robert Becker, a former top Sanders field staffer, was accused of forcibly kissing a subordinate.\n\nAmid pressure to demonstrate that a 2020 campaign would not repeat the same mistakes, Sanders\u2019 former campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, announced Wednesday that he would not be returning in that role for a second run. Sanders has also apologized for the mistreatment of some women and promised that his campaign team has already taken steps to improve.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s livestream, Sanders allies applied a dual approach to addressing the controversy. On the one hand, DeMoro implied that some of the negative stories were the product of ideologically driven efforts to undermine Sanders.\n\n\u201cEven though Bernie has not announced yet, the opposition certainly has,\u201d said DeMoro, one of the only national labor union leaders to back Sanders in 2016. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to take Bernie out; they\u2019re trying to take the movement out.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Sheila Healy, who worked on Sanders\u2019 successful 2018 Senate re-election, told supporters that his campaign had implemented much tougher measures to prevent future workplace issues.\n\nHealy noted that the Senate campaign had created a human resources hotline which employees could use to report harassment without fear of retaliation or discomfort, provided mandatory sexual harassment training to all staff and volunteers, and made sure that the signs explaining the campaign\u2019s anti-harassment policy were posted visibly in all areas.\n\n\u201cI can say with certainty, if the senator does decide to run, these new policies are going to remain in place in 2020,\u201d she said.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if they can beat Trump.

Amber Watson, speaking of other potential Democratic candidates\n\nIn Lindsey Ullman and Charles Frantz\u2019s stylish two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn\u2019s Bushwick neighborhood, about 20 hardcore Sanders fans gathered to watch the livestream over pizza, beer and LaCroix. Following the recommendations of the livestream organizers, they subsequently discussed strategies for improving on Sanders\u2019 impressive but ultimately failed 2016 performance.\n\nUllman, a graphic designer, and Frantz, a software engineer, knew only two of the attendees beforehand. The people who had signed up for their gathering through the Organizing for Bernie website now displayed their names and preferred pronouns on name tags.\n\nThe crowd skewed younger and whiter with a roughly even gender balance. About half of those present were active in the Democratic Socialists of America, a dues-paying organization that saw its ranks explode in the wake of Sanders\u2019 2016 run.\n\nSome of the partygoers were convinced that Sanders needed to run because he was the most electable candidate in a head-to-head matchup against Trump.\n\nReferring to other candidates, Amber Watson, a sound engineer, said, \u201cThey haven\u2019t run in any presidential elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they can beat Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe pretty much know Bernie can beat Trump.\u201d\n\nReferring to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Russell Whitehouse, a progressive activist and internet entrepreneur, said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work last time. We ran a centrist last time.\u201d\n\nBut other attendees simply believed that Sanders is the politician most authentically committed to enacting Medicare for all, free college and the dramatic measures needed to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is the policies,\u201d said Andy Simpson, a Manhattanite who crossed the East River to attend the party.\n\nAsked about other rumored contenders\u2019 adoption of some of Sanders\u2019 core policy positions, like Medicare for all, Dave Crumbley, a standup comic visiting from Ohio, replied, \u201cIt\u2019s lip service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Bernie is the only candidate who could inspire this kind of gathering says it all,\u201d Ullman said.\n\nFrantz offered one caveat: If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a former Sanders organizer, were 35 years old \u2015 and thus eligible to serve as president \u2015 she might be capable of generating the same level of enthusiasm.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-beto-orourke-presidential-primary-feud-former-staff_us_5c27d084e4b08aaf7a91035a": "ASSOCIATED PRESS/Eric Gay, File Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas), the 2018 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Texas, makes his concession speech at his election night party in El Paso, Texas.\n\nThe progressive commentariat has been buzzing in recent weeks about the barrage of unflattering reporting and criticism directed at retiring Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) by left-leaning journalists and activists.\n\nAlthough Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 team insists he has had nothing to do with the criticism and there is no evidence to suggest he has, many of his supporters have indeed been peeved by the boomlet of hype around O\u2019Rourke following his 3-percentage-point loss in the race for a Senate seat in Texas.\n\nBut there is a specific factor driving the frustration of some diehard \u201cBerniecrats\u201d that has thus far received little attention: The defection of key alumni from Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential run to the O\u2019Rourke camp and the resulting worry that they will provide a progressive coat of paint for the Texan\u2019s more moderate record.\n\nBecky Bond and Zack Malitz are two of those figures. The pair had a major role in shaping Sanders\u2019 innovative \u201cdistributed\u201d organizing model that the candidate used to empower decentralized, self-organizing groups of volunteers in lieu of a much larger, more expensive cohort of field staff. They masterminded a similar setup for O\u2019Rourke in his 2018 Senate run.\n\nBond and Malitz have already pledged themselves to O\u2019Rourke if he jumps into the presidential race.\n\n\u201cThey are using their Bernie credibility to whitewash Beto\u2019s policies,\u201d said a progressive strategist sympathetic to Sanders who declined to be named for professional reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s Bernie-washing.\u201d\n\nAs for those policies, progressive critics point to a number of examples. O\u2019Rourke, a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, has voted for bills lifting the ban on exporting crude oil and granting presidents a fast-track approval process for international trade agreements. Over three terms in Congress he also failed to sign on to a single-payer health care bill that had the support of the majority of House Democrats, though as a Senate candidate he said that if elected, he would support Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill.\n\nBond and Malitz aren\u2019t the only Sanders alumni likely to bolt for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team if he runs.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also tapped Middle Seat, a digital strategy and fundraising firm founded by Sanders alumni Kenneth Pennington, Hector Sigala and Elizabeth Bennett, to run the digital operation for his Senate campaign. And Linh Nguyen, another former Sanders digital staffer, migrated to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign as well.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Middle Seat is \u201choping\u201d to join a potential O\u2019Rourke 2020 bid as well; Pennington declined to comment in response to a HuffPost inquiry.\n\nSanders\u2019 most ardent supporters say they are not worried that O\u2019Rourke will deprive Sanders of top organizing firepower or signal an exodus of former Sanders talent to the O\u2019Rourke team in the event that both men run for president.\n\nTim Tagaris and Robin Curran, who led Sanders\u2019 digital fundraising team, have already pledged to return to the Sanders fold, according to the Sanders campaign. And Pennington had a public falling out with Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 longtime adviser and 2016 campaign manager, in August 2016, long before O\u2019Rourke became a nationally recognized figure.\n\nSanders\u2019 midterm campaign swing showed there \u201cis a tremendous outpouring of support [for him] that still exists at the grassroots level,\u201d Weaver told HuffPost. \u201cI have an email inbox and voicemail full of messages from former staffers who want to rejoin a campaign if it happens.\u201d\n\nWeaver would not comment on O\u2019Rourke or any other potential candidates.\n\nBut some Sanders loyalists nonetheless fear that the presence of some high-profile Sanders alumni closely associated with Sanders\u2019 most successful tactics will obscure O\u2019Rourke\u2019s centrist policy record.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying O\u2019Rourke is a bridge to the Bernie wing because of Zack and Becky,\u201d the progressive strategist said.\n\nEven if Bond, Malitz and other Sanders alumni have not magnified O\u2019Rourke\u2019s notoriety by association, they certainly have done so by leveraging the Sanders playbook to help O\u2019Rourke succeed, according to Charles Lenchner, a co-founder of The People for Bernie Sanders, a pro-Sanders group with a big social media following that is not tied to the campaign.\n\nThe use of campaign tactics and the enthusiasm they generate among the grassroots is effectively used as a substitute for policy. Charles Lenchner, the People for Bernie Sanders\n\nNow Lenchner and others worry that establishment Democrats like Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden and former Obama adviser David Axelrod are excited about O\u2019Rourke precisely because he provides an opportunity to tap into the youth vote that Sanders excited without Sanders\u2019 left-wing policies. These Sanders acolytes see a precedent for it in the way that former President Barack Obama\u2019s dynamic organizing style obscured a more centrist governing record.\n\n\u201cThe use of campaign tactics and the enthusiasm they generate among the grassroots is effectively used as a substitute for policy,\u201d said Lenchner, who is now digital director of the left-wing news outlet The Real News.\n\nMurshed Zaheed, who worked with Bond and Malitz at the progressive cellphone company Credo Action and emphasized his deep admiration for Bond, nonetheless shared Lenchner\u2019s concern.\n\nO\u2019Rourke \u201cwants to take the tactical underpinnings of the Bernie campaign and put his polish on it, but not necessarily in a way that is progressive on policy,\u201d said Zaheed, who is now a principal at the left-leaning consulting shop Strategy and Hustle, and has not yet settled on a candidate in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cGrassroots organizing does not make a candidate progressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that Becky [Bond] and Zack [Malitz] found Barack Obama\u2019s presidency to be disappointing. So it doesn\u2019t add up then,\u201d said Anthony Rogers-Wright, an African-American climate justice activist and former member of Sanders\u2019 policy team.\n\nReferring to Rules for Revolutionaries, Bond\u2019s 2016 book with fellow Sanders alum Zack Exley, Rodgers-Wright quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s not Beto. I could see that book being more applicable to [former Florida gubernatorial candidate] Andrew Gillum than Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in some ways, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s record is more conservative than Obama\u2019s. As journalist David Sirota, who briefly worked for Sanders in the early 2000s, noted in his exhaustive analysis of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s legislative history, the El Paso congressman voted for bills undermining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the creation of which Obama oversaw.\n\nStill, Bond, Malitz and the other Sanders alumni drifting toward O\u2019Rourke have their defenders within Bernie World. Shaun King, a black civil rights activist who was a top surrogate for Sanders in 2016, joined Bond in co-founding the Real Justice PAC, a group dedicated to electing more progressive prosecutors, in February. He said his friendship with Bond and Malitz contributes to his confidence in O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cThey grew to believe in Beto like I think they grew to believe in Bernie. It\u2019s real,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cThey would have no interest in putting progressive clothes on Beto,\u201d he added. \u201cThey believe he is a deeply progressive person and will be a deeply progressive leader.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/J. Scott Applewhite Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), joined at left by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), holds a news conference after the Senate passed a resolution pulling aid from the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nAsked to respond to some of the criticism herself, Bond sent HuffPost the unabridged text of a statement she previously provided to The New York Times explaining her support for a would-be O\u2019Rourke presidential run. In it, Bond emphasized O\u2019Rourke\u2019s freewheeling campaign style and commitment to reaching voters in person.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other 2020 contender who has had the sheer number of conversations with voters as Beto has over the past two years,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also stressed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s strengths as an advocate for immigration reform and racial justice. (The most viral moments of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign featured him eloquently denouncing police killings of unarmed black men and the right of football players like Colin Kaepernick to protest those killings.)\n\n\u201cWhat other potential candidate has addressed the refugee and immigration crisis as boldly or compellingly as Beto has?\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd this country needs a leader with the moral clarity on racial justice that Beto demonstrated again and again on the campaign trail in Texas.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s precisely because turning out voters of color, and championing issues that affect them directly, is such a high priority for any Democratic candidate that some Democrats outside of Sanders\u2019 camp question whether O\u2019Rourke, a white man, is really the right choice in a field that is likely to include several nonwhite contenders.\n\nSteve Phillips, a prominent Democratic donor who started a super PAC in support of a likely presidential run by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, believes Booker is best poised to \u201crebuild the Obama coalition\u201d of voters of color and white progressives.\n\nPhillips has encouraged O\u2019Rourke, Gillum and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams \u2015 all of whom lost by narrow margins \u2015 to run again for statewide office rather than jumping in the presidential pool.\n\nStill, he wonders why O\u2019Rourke\u2019s impressive but ultimately failed Senate bid has generated more presidential buzz than the gubernatorial runs of Gillum and Abrams, both of whom are black and lost by fewer percentage points than O\u2019Rourke did.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-walmart-minimum-wage_us_5bedc525e4b0443db862a5a8": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Sen. Bernie Sanders shamed Amazon so badly over its employee pay that the online retailer announced a new $15 minimum wage last month. Now the Vermont independent has set his sights on another low-wage bogeyman and Amazon competitor: Walmart.\n\nIn a bill introduced Thursday, titled the Stop WALMART Act, Sanders is following essentially the same strategy that drove Amazon to say it would raise the starting pay in its fulfillment centers.\n\n\u201cYou have the wealthiest family in the United States, worth $180 billion,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost, referring to the Waltons, who own a majority stake in Walmart. \u201cThey\u2019re paying workers starvation wages.\u201d\n\nThe Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies Act, introduced by Sanders in September, would punish large companies for paying workers poorly enough that they qualify for welfare programs. The shorter version of its name, Stop BEZOS Act, pointed the finger directly at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe Walmart bill \u2015 more formally, the Stop Welfare for Any Large Monopoly Amassing Revenue from Taxpayers Act \u2015 also ties one high-profile company to an unsavory practice. In this case, it\u2019s stock buybacks, which have surged this year in the wake of the big corporate tax cut that Republicans passed last December.\n\nAnd again the goal is to increase the lowest paid workers\u2019 wages. Under the proposal, large companies would not be allowed to buy back their own stock unless all their workers earned at least $15 per hour and their CEOS earned no more than 150 times what their median employee earned.\n\nA Walmart spokesman said the starting pay for its store employees is at least $11 per hour, and more in certain markets. \u201cWe have increased our starting wages by more than 50 percent in the last three years,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that its average hourly compensation is $17.50 when benefits like health care are taken into account.\n\nA lot of employers have begun to pay higher wages as the economy has improved over the last few years, forcing companies to compete more for workers. In the cases of both Amazon and Walmart, it\u2019s hard to tell how much their pay hikes are due to company strategy or public pressure or simply market forces. The higher minimum wages being mandated by cities and states are also a factor.\n\nThough the new Sanders bill highlights Walmart in its title, the legislation would apply to any company that meets the criteria it lays out. The bill is unlikely to become law, mainly because Republicans still control the Senate and the White House.\n\nBut not even Democrats necessarily go along with Sanders\u2019 message bills \u2015 not a single senator co-sponsored his Amazon legislation. Some liberals have even argued that the Stop BEZOS Act would make for bad public policy if it passed. (\u201cMy think tank friends,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday.)\n\nStock buybacks have earned much liberal ire this year, as corporate cash has been funneled to shareholders instead of workers. Reducing the supply of a corporation\u2019s stock on the market inflates its value and typically benefits the company\u2019s executives, who are paid at least partially in stock and receive bonuses based on stock performance.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who introduced companion legislation in the House, pointed out that stock buybacks were not even totally legal before a 1982 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t allowed to engage in manipulation of stock to enrich shareholders and to enrich executives,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Sanders wants both Walmart and Amazon to pay at least $15 per hour, the huge chain\u2019s front-line retail jobs are fundamentally different from the online giant\u2019s fulfillment center jobs. The latter tend to be more physically demanding and come with higher pay. The median materials moving worker earned $14.78 per hour in 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the median retail sales employee made just $11.24.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-preview-south-carolina-iowa_us_5bd21cf1e4b0a8f17ef5bf9c": "Digital First Media/Longmont Times-Call/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) greets supporters in Boulder, Colorado, on Wednesday. As he campaigns on behalf of the Democratic cause in this year's midterms, he's also gearing up for another White House run.\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2015 South Carolina was the site of one of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 most humiliating defeats in his 2016 presidential run. He received just 26 percent of the vote in the Palmetto State\u2019s early primary, presaging a shutout in the South that virtually assured Hillary Clinton the Democratic nomination.\n\nWorse still, his South Carolina defeat epitomized the difficulty he had attracting support from black voters, a core constituency for the Democratic Party.\n\nAhead of a political rally last Saturday, there were signs that the state remained unwelcoming terrain for Sanders. Two of the state\u2019s veteran Democratic officials carped in the press that he should \u201cget lost,\u201d arguing that the visit was unhelpful in a conservative state where the party\u2019s candidates usually compete by tacking to the center.\n\nBut when Sanders walked onto the University of South Carolina stage to the adulation of some 1,000 supporters waving \u201cMedicare for Y\u2019all\u201d placards, it was clear that he had his share of supporters here. Feeding on the crowd\u2019s energy, he dispensed with his detractors with a bit of gentle sarcasm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great turnout. And it\u2019s kind of funny, I was told that there were no progressives in South Carolina,\u201d he deadpanned to an approving crowd.\n\n.@berniesanders remarks on crowd size, jokes \u201cI thought there were no progressives in South Carolina.\u201d pic.twitter.com/2qyoZjc2Rv \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) October 20, 2018\n\nWelcome to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. In a warm-up for an anticipated second run by Sanders, he\u2019s been promoting the party\u2019s prospects in the Nov. 6 elections during a nine-state campaign swing that began in Bloomington, Indiana, on Oct. 19 and wraps up in Oakland, California, this Saturday. He\u2019ll be joined on that last stop by Rep. Barbara Lee of California, a fellow progressive stalwart running for chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nThe South Carolina event, organized by the state chapter of Our Revolution, the group built to carry on the mission of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, was billed as a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d rally. It was Sanders\u2019 first trip back to South Carolina since the primary battle in \u201916.\n\nThe boisterous health care rally showed the unique position Sanders occupies within the already-crowded field of rumored 2020 presidential contenders: He\u2019s done it before and he has the organizational muscle to show for it, even in a state like South Carolina where he fared poorly in \u201916.\n\nDuring his 40-minute remarks in South Carolina and in three speeches in Iowa later on Saturday and on Sunday in Iowa, Sanders did little to conceal that he is strongly considering another presidential run. He spent a good chunk of his time recounting how the policies he championed as a presidential candidate are now squarely in the Democratic mainstream.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, when I was in South Carolina and other states campaigning, my opponent and editorial writers all across the country ... they said, \u2018Bernie Sanders is nuts. He is far out. His ideas are extreme. Nobody supports those wild ideas,\u2019\u201d he said with a mock sense of alarm. \u201cWell, guess what happened folks? Three years have come and gone, and those ideas that were seen to be radical and extreme three years ago are today mainstream, supported by the vast majority of America.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats out of power in Washington, there\u2019s been no chance his most ambitious ideas could become law. But there\u2019s also clear evidence his proposals have picked up steam among Democrats.\n\nSanders\u2019 September 2017 single-payer health care legislation received the support of about one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus; even former President Barack Obama has praised the underlying policy. And as Sanders is fond of noting on the stump, 70 percent of Americans say they support \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d according to a Reuters poll in August.\n\nAn April 2017 bill to make $15 the federal minimum wage, which once had paltry support from his colleagues, now enjoys majority support within the Senate\u2019s Democratic ranks. And most recently, Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) successfully pressured Amazon into adopting a $15 minimum wage.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images Sanders and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) walked with Rev. William Barber of North Carolina, a civil rights leader, during a Capitol Hill protest in 2017 of the GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. Barber ended up being arrested.\n\n\u201cWe Are Not Going Backwards\u201d\n\nSanders, who sermonizes about U.S. politics in stark moral terms, remains most comfortable expounding on economic policy. It is a tendency that has elicited criticism from some liberals eager to hear him address systemic racial justice and entrenched sexism in more explicit terms.\n\nThe problems for the Brooklyn-born Vermonter didn\u2019t end with the 2016 election. His April 2017 decision to campaign for Democrat Heath Mello, an abortion-rights opponent who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, raised eyebrows on the left.\n\nBut Sanders has since taken pains to court black allies, champion policies outside of what are often strictly defined as \u201ceconomic justice\u201d issues and incorporate them into his stump speech. He can no longer be fairly depicted as a politician narrowly focused on economic or class issues.\n\nWhen asked in an April interview with HuffPost whether he had grown more sensitive to the need to speak to the particular challenges facing black Americans \u2015 who comprise just a sliver of Vermont\u2019s population \u2015 Sanders admitted that he had.\n\nI imagine going forward, he\u2019s gonna engage in South Carolina in a very different way. Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party\n\n\u201cI traveled to 48 states in this country. I have traveled to many, many African American communities and I have talked to a whole lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope my views change in response to what I have learned.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 transformation is evident in his policy agenda. The inclusion of abortion coverage in his single-payer health care bill won plaudits from women\u2019s groups. He commemorated the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee; held an anti-poverty rally with civil rights leader Rev. William Barber, in Durham, North Carolina; and convened a live panel discussion on economic inequality that prominently featured people who specialize in the unique barriers facing Americans of color.\n\nAnd in June, he introduced legislation eliminating the use of cash bail, which a press release from his office noted \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affects black, Latinx and Native American people.\n\nSanders speeches in South Carolina and Iowa reflected this diversified focus. He called the criminal justice system \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cracist,\u201d and mused about \u201chow hypocritical\u201d Republicans are who preach small government, except when it comes to women\u2019s abortion rights.\n\nHe concluded his remarks on an optimistic note, citing Americans\u2019 long history of overcoming prejudice and hatred.\n\n\u201cI say to President (Donald) Trump that this country has struggled for too many years, for too many centuries in combating racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia,\u201d Sanders declared. \u201cWe are not going backwards. We are going forwards \u2015 as one people.\u201d\n\nMaurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and a featured speaker at the South Carolina rally, told HuffPost that since the \u201916 primary, Sanders has \u201cbuilt relationships [in South Carolina] and he understands the terrain.\n\n\u201cI imagine going forward, he\u2019s gonna engage in South Carolina in a very different way,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nKC McGinnis / Reuters Sen. Kamala Harris of California is among other Democrats viewed as a presidential contender in 2020.\n\nAt times, Sanders\u2019 current tour revealed some of the limits of his reach. The crowd at the South Carolina rally was somewhat diverse, but it was visibly whiter than the population of Columbia, which is 41 percent black.\n\nAnd it was telling that neither the state\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. James Smith, nor any of the party\u2019s House contenders shared the stage with Sanders.\n\nThe rally was the product of a longstanding invitation from the state\u2019s Our Revolution chapter, according to his staff, which did not comment on the absence of the various candidates.\n\nTrav Robertson, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, criticized party colleagues who blasted Sanders for his visit and said he welcomed the visit.\n\nIf Sanders or other national Democratic leaders are \u201cgoing to bring national attention\u201d to Republican policies in the state that have led to hospital closures and higher utility bills, Robertson said, \u201cLet \u2019em come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting when national figures localize our issues,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHey hey ho ho Steve King has got to go.\u201d pic.twitter.com/AkqYbyCp7I \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) October 21, 2018\n\nOver the course of his day-and-a-half in Iowa, Sanders participated in no fewer than four campaign events for J.D. Scholten, who is waging a long-shot bid to unseat infamous white nationalist Rep. Steve King in Iowa\u2019s heavily rural 4th Congressional District.\n\nScholten, a former minor league baseball pitcher and devout Catholic, is a natural ideological fit for the Brooklyn-born Sanders. Casting himself as heir to the forgotten tradition of farmer populists in Iowa, Scholten is running in support of Medicare for all and taking on the monopoly seed and livestock conglomerates he believes are squeezing small farmers.\n\nIn an interview aboard his district-traversing RV \u201cSioux City Sue,\u201d Scholten dismissed the idea that Sanders\u2019 left-wing policies might be a political liability in his district.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things at play right now that are not left or right \u2015 they\u2019re Iowa issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our tariffs, it\u2019s these farmlands all around us.\u201d\n\nBut among Iowa\u2019s three GOP-held House seats, Democrats like their odds better in the 1st Congressional District, which includes Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, and the 3rd, which includes the Des Moines metropolitan area. Sanders\u2019 campaign did not reach out to the campaigns of Abby Finkenauer, the Democrat running in the 1st, or Cindy Axne, the nominee in the 3rd. While Finkenauer does not appear with out-of-state Democrats, Axne welcomed Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to a campaign rally on Monday.\n\nSanders campaigned for Scholten after Scholten reached out to him, according to Sanders\u2019 staff, which did not comment on Finkenauer or Axne.\n\nLooking Ahead To 2020\n\nAs attention turns to the 2020 Democratic presidential race, the 77-year-old Sanders benefits from his surprisingly strong showing in 2016 against Clinton, who began that race as the prohibitive favorite. But some party strategists believe a big reason for his success was voter antipathy toward her.\n\nHis appeal has yet to be tested in a field with several strong candidates \u2015 a field that may well include Harris along with Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOne thing that Sanders clearly does not see as an obstacle is his age. Though that issue would likely surface, its importance could be diminished if the 75-year-old Biden enters the race. And by Election Day in 2020, Trump will be 74.\n\nAfter a standing-room-only rally over the weekend at Iowa State, Sanders, Scholten and Iowa Secretary of State candidate Deidre DeJear headed to the school\u2019s sports complex to shoot some hoops for the cameras.\n\nAs Sanders was walking out of the facility in shirtsleeves, a student called out to him. \u201cBernie, are you tired yet?\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-climate-change_us_5bf20e9ce4b0f32bd58aae6e": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is hosting a livestreamed summit on climate change next month, intensifying pressure on the new Congress and TV networks to devote attention to the crisis.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will host a livestreamed town hall summit on climate change next month, a move that may intensify pressure on the next Congress to curb planet-warming emissions and challenge TV networks to cover a rapidly worsening crisis they\u2019ve long ignored.\n\nThe 90-minute event \u2015 scheduled from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 3 \u2015 will be held at the Capitol Visitor Center Auditorium in Washington and broadcast over Facebook, YouTube and Twitter by seven progressive media outlets.\n\n\u201cWe need millions of people all over this country to stand up and demand fundamental changes in our energy policy in order to protect our kids and our grandchildren and the planet,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost by phone. \u201cThe good news is the American people are beginning to stand up and fight back.\u201d\n\nSpeakers include 350.org founder Bill McKibben, activist and \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d star Shailene Woodley, climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel, activist and musician Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, and Mayor Dale Ross of deep-red Georgetown, Texas, whose avowedly pragmatic embrace of newly cheap renewable energy has made him a poster boy for how Republicans could quit climate change denialism.\n\nIt\u2019s the fifth live-broadcast town hall Sanders has hosted. Past programs examined the universal health care proposal Medicare for All, inequality, the Iran nuclear deal, and workers vs. chief executives.\n\nThe event bolsters Sanders, a likely contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, as the most serious candidate on climate change, offering a far more comprehensive response than rival progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who staked out a climate policy based on a bill to force public companies to disclose financial risk from warming or regulations to curb emissions.\n\nThe summit, which took months to plan, will take place less than a month after Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) propelled talk of a so-called Green New Deal into the Democratic mainstream, giving play for the first time to the sort of federal response to climate change scientists say is necessary to fully meet the scale of the crisis. In October, the United Nations concluded world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years or risk catastrophic warming with $54 trillion in damage.\n\nThe historic wildfire that left 63 dead and 631 missing in Northern California this month, in what was once the Golden State\u2019s rainy season, offers a glimpse of that future, Sanders warned.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Search and rescue workers search for human remains at a trailer park burned by the Camp Fire in Northern California.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is a growing consciousness,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe horrors that we\u2019ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced \u2015 this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long, hard struggle to transform our energy system.\u201d\n\nClimate remains a low priority for most voters. Just 38 percent of registered voters said candidates\u2019 positions on global warming would be \u201cvery important\u201d to their voting decisions, according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th of 28 issues voters ranked in the questionnaire.\n\nBut among liberal Democrats in that poll, the issue ranked fourth, behind health care, gun policies and general environmental protections. A YouGov survey of 2018 voters found 75 percent of Democrats strongly supported charging companies with big carbon dioxide footprints a polluter fee, and 56 percent favored giving unemployed Americans federally backed jobs in energy efficiency and weatherization.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections, the fossil fuel industry spent $100 million to crush pro-climate ballot measures across the West, and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so-called eco-socialists. And a new majority of Democratic state attorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages.\n\nActivists, freshly galvanized by the hellscape images of California\u2019s deadliest wildfire, seem primed for action, and the party\u2019s progressive wing has signaled a new willingness to force a more serious debate over an issue that\u2019s remained stagnant in the House for much of the past decade.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [climate change] is that high among the base of one of our two major political parties is remarkable, because that was not the case even five years ago,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, a senior research scientist and Yale\u2019s climate program director. \u201cIf you think of Bernie, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be talking about inequality or civil rights. There\u2019s a whole host of progressive issues, yet this is the one he\u2019s leading with. It may suggest there\u2019s been an alignment of the stars.\u201d\n\nLast week, youth activists with the grassroots climate group Sunrise Movement staged sit-ins in the offices of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the likely next chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who opposed the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal.\n\nAt least three sitting members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus agreed to back a resolution Ocasio-Cortez proposed to establish a 15-member Green New Deal panel. Activists are hoping Sanders\u2019 event will add the 2016 presidential contender\u2019s star power to their movement.\n\nThe horrors that we\u2019ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced \u2015 this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long hard struggle to transform our energy system. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\n\u201cHe helped popularize things like Medicare for All, a living wage and a lot of other fights he\u2019s taken up,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of Sunrise Movement. \u201cI hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire that\u2019s been lit under politicians and the public over the past week.\u201d\n\nSanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in April 2017, he co-sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100-percent clean energy by 2050. The bill included $7 billion in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil-fuel communities, and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs. In November 2017, Sanders introduced a bill to spend $146 billion rebuilding storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is extremely bold legislation,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf there are Democrats who cannot support it, well, we\u2019ve got to push pressure on them.\u201d\n\nThe relative absence of climate science from TV broadcasts that dominate American political discourse makes it hard to raise awareness of the near-term threats warming poses.\n\nSeventy-one percent of major, televised debates in the 2018 midterm elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of the 107 segments ABC, CBS and NBC aired from Nov. 8 to Nov. 13 on the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change. In 2017, the influential Sunday morning talk shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News aired a combined 260 minutes of climate coverage, 79 percent of which focused exclusively on President Donald Trump\u2019s personal beliefs on science and his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of huge consequence and you would think that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox would be talking about this every day, having the debate, \u2018What do we do? Where do we go?\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cClearly you aren\u2019t seeing that debate.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 inequality town hall in March drew 1.7 million viewers. Similar numbers might show cable news producers that climate change is not, as MSNBC host Chris Hayes revealingly described it in July, a \u201cratings killer.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-ro-khanna-prescription-drugs_us_5bf3192ce4b01909c808652f": "The problem with prescription drugs is simple: The U.S. government bestows long-term monopolies on pharmaceutical companies, immunizing them from the forces of market competition and public regulation. As a result, Americans shoulder the highest drug prices in the world while receiving significantly poorer public health outcomes than most of the developed world.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to address that problem, but a new proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) would attack prescription drug price-gouging at the source: the government-granted monopoly that gives Big Pharma unchecked pricing power.\n\n\u201cNo other country allows pharmaceutical companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cSomebody in America today can walk into a pharmacy and find out that the medicine they have been using for years can double, triple or quadruple literally overnight. That needs to change.\u201d\n\nEvery year, the United States spends over $1,200 per person on pharmaceuticals, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That\u2019s more than double the rate in the United Kingdom and nearly double the rate in France \u2015 and yet the typical French citizen can expect to live more than four years longer than the typical American, and those in the United Kingdom enjoy three extra years, on average, relative to their American counterparts, according to the World Health Organization. The disparities are even more dramatic between the U.S. and Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn 2015, Bloomberg News compared different countries\u2019 spending on a host of major prescription drugs. A months\u2019 supply of the arthritis treatment Humira cost about $2,500 in the U.S. \u2015 roughly 50 percent more than the same supply of the same drug in Germany, and more than double the price in Canada and the U.K. The asthma medication Advair runs about $150 a month in the U.S. \u2014 roughly double the price of the same drug in Canada and triple its cost in Japan. For cutting-edge cancer drugs, prices in the U.S. exceed those in other countries by several thousand dollars per month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders and Khanna will unveil a new bill that would direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize generic competition for any name-brand drug whose average domestic cost exceeds the median price in five reference countries: Canada, the U.K., Germany, France and Japan.\n\n\u201cThe government is giving an exclusive monopoly to pharmaceuticals,\u201d Khanna told HuffPost. \u201cIf a company abuses that grant by fleecing American consumers, then they lose that privilege, that property grant, that subsidy from the government.\u201d\n\nIf the bill \u2014 dubbed The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act \u2014 were to become law, experts anticipate that drug companies would dramatically reduce prices rather than risk ceding market share to a generic competitor. \u201cNo company would want to lose its legal monopoly as a consequence of charging U.S. residents prices higher than in the reference countries,\u201d said Jamie Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that specializes in intellectual property issues.\n\nThe bill from Sanders and Khanna isn\u2019t going to become law anytime soon. It faces fervent opposition from Republicans, who will still control the Senate when Congress reconvenes next year. Even getting a vote in the House will depend on whether the Democrats in charge of key committees decide to greenlight it \u2015 a choice that will likely depend at least in part on the whims of top leadership.\n\nBut the legislation nevertheless sends a statement about the priorities of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and its intent to deliver on the campaign promises Democrats issued around the 2018 midterms, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s election night pledge to \u201ctake real, very, very strong legislative action to negotiate down the price control of prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development. We pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen\n\nPharmaceutical firms typically argue that long-term monopolies are necessary to justify the money they spend on research and development. And major drug companies do spend billions of dollars a year on R&D \u2015 but not nearly as much as they spend on marketing, meaning that most of the costs recouped by monopoly profits aren\u2019t essential to groundbreaking science. Nearly all research funded by pharmaceutical companies, moreover, piggybacks on government-backed research conducted by the National Institutes of Health. One study published earlier this year concluded that every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 relied on at least some government-funded research, reflecting over $100 billion of public investment.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a public interest nonprofit. \u201cWe pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers, and then stands aside as Big Pharma exploits those monopolies to price gouge.\u201d\n\nThe United States is in a class by itself on prescription drug costs, but the five reference countries included in the Sanders bill are a relatively generous comparison pool. Three of them \u2015 Germany, Japan and Canada \u2015 are in the top five in per-capita pharmaceutical spending among OECD nations. International reference pricing is common among wealthy nations, with 29 of 31 European Union nations taking foreign drug prices into account when considering domestic price policy, according to the European Commission.\n\nPatents on prescription drugs are a longstanding feature of both American law and international trade agreements, in part due to the outsized influence of the pharmaceutical lobby within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. But international law provides various exceptions patent-holders\u2019 privileges when it comes to public health \u2015 which is why so many countries party to the World Trade Organization and other trade treaties can obtain lower drug prices than the U.S. does. Though Khanna and Sanders crafted their bill to crack down on the monopoly, the legislation would not technically violate a drug company\u2019s patent \u2015 just change the legal substance of what that patent secured.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-trump-wall-speech_us_5c356a28e4b0f5aba7d9455e": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen.

(He didn\u2019t mention, however, that the Trump administration has continued processing oil and gas drilling permits, according to Bloomberg.)\n\nMr. President, we don\u2019t need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nThen, Sanders recalled the Senate bill to fund the government that passed unanimously on Dec. 19 and said it was \u201cwidely expected\u201d that the next day, \u201cthe House would do the same\u201d and \u201cthe government would remain open.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, President Trump, who started receiving criticism from an assortment of right-wing ideologues, changed his mind about the agreement,\u201d Sanders said.

But as he gears up for a second White House bid, the senator is making climate change a central focus of his campaign.\n\nIn December, he hosted a televised town hall talk on global warming and repeatedly tried to push the policy debate beyond whether or not climate science is real and toward \u201ca political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires, accelerates our transition to clean energy, and finally puts people before the profits of polluters.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanders-wants-fbi-to-determine-if-kavanaugh-told-the-truth-under-oath_us_5baff444e4b0c7575965a236": "Sen.

Elizabeth Warren officially announced her presidential bid near the banks of the Merrimack River here on Saturday, picking a highly symbolic location that points to both long, worker-centric political tradition Warren seeks to inherit and the challenge she might face in winning over an increasingly diverse Democratic party.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way,\u201d Warren said at the Everett Mills, where a group of Polish women walked off the job in January 1912, setting off the famous Bread and Roses Strike, when tens of thousands of immigrant workers united to shut down the city\u2019s textile mills for the winter, winning substantial raises and safer work conditions.\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Elizabeth Warren is done exploring. She's running for president.\n\nWarren\u2019s official entry into the race to win the Democratic nod to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 has been expected since she announced the formation of an exploratory committee in late December. She joins a field that already includes three of her fellow Democratic senators \u2015 New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker, California\u2019s Kamala Harris and New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand \u2015 and could soon include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, along with a host of other candidates.\n\nShe launched her campaign with an introduction from Rep. Joe Kennedy III, winning the blessing of the highest-profile member of the first family of Democratic politics, and with the backing of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and fellow Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole,\u201d said Kennedy, a former student of Warren\u2019s at Harvard Law School. \u201cA leader that will bring us together to confront our great threat: A system that protects the powerful and the privileged.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a practical reason to announce in Lawrence \u2015 it\u2019s a quick, 10-minute drive to New Hampshire, which hosts the first-in-the-nation primary \u2015 but the symbolic reasons to choose the former mill town 40 minutes north of Boston instead of a more prominent locale are stronger. The Bread and Roses Strike, which was led in large part by women, immigrants and immigrant women, is a rich historical text for Warren to invoke during a speech announcing her bid. It allows Warren to connect to a landmark moment in labor history, and it also links her directly to one of just a handful of majority-minority cities in her home state, giving her a chance to show her appeal to the voters who may ultimately decide the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about immigrants, it\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about workers\u2019 rights, it\u2019s about pay equity,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s about everything Elizabeth Warren has spent her life fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe Bread and Roses strike began in response to a pay cut of 32 cents a week. The roughly 30,000 people who worked in the mills were crowded into tenement houses, having arrived in Lawrence from more than 50 different nations. Seven of eight people who worked in the mills were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. At the city\u2019s dominant employer \u2015 the American Woolen Company \u2015 half of the employees were women between the ages of 14 and 18. While doctors in Lawrence had a life expectancy of 65, more than one-third of mill workers died before age 25.\n\nThe strike quickly led to clashes with local police, and a state militia was called in. The Industrial Workers of the World organized the strikers, and soon news of the strike was dominating the nation\u2019s newspapers. Wealthy suffragettes, believing their struggle for the right to vote was linked to that of the strikers, began supporting them financially. To draw additional attention to the cause, the mothers of Lawrence sent their children by train to New York City, a so-called \u201cChildren\u2019s Exodus.\u201d The sight of the malnourished children drew more sympathy to the strikers\u2019 cause. In late February, as a second group of children prepared to leave for Philadelphia, police began clubbing them and their parents. The violence drew further condemnation, and soon both the U.S. House and Senate began investigating the conditions in Lawrence.\n\nIn March, owners agreed to a 15 percent raise for the mill workers, to give double pay for overtime and to improve safety conditions in the mills. The eventual agreement ending the strike was read aloud in Arabic, Polish, Armenian and a slew of other languages, reflecting the diversity of the strikers.\n\nJournalist Bruce Watson, in his book on the strike, \u201cBread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream,\u201d wrote that in 1912, \u201cthe great rudder of a stable society, the middle class, had not yet been invented.\u201d But within months of the end of the strike, Warren noted, Massachusetts became the first state in the country with a minimum wage, part of a newly empowered labor movement that would soon win a 40-hour work week and the elimination of child labor.\n\nIn Warren\u2019s telling of American history, the middle class that the strike helped create over the following decades has fallen by the wayside. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident. It wasn\u2019t inevitable,\u201d she said, pointing the finger at power-hungry lobbyists, misguided Republicans and the corrupting influence of corporate money on politics that she said had derailed progress on everything from gun control to climate change. \u201cOver the years, America\u2019s middle class had been deliberately hollowed out.\u201d\n\nTo fix it, Warren argues, involves more than throwing Trump out of office, and requires a more aggressive form of liberal politics. \u201cToday, millions and millions and millions of American families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well-connected,\u201d she said during her 40-minute speech. \u201cCorruption is a cancer on our democracy. And we will get rid of it only with strong medicine \u2015 with real, structural reform.\u201d\n\nBut Lawrence\u2019s story is as much about immigration as it is about labor. \u201cThe city of Lawrence symbolizes what our country stands for. The wave after wave of immigrants who come to this country seeking a better life,\u201d said Juana Matias, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who previously represented Lawrence in the Massachusetts State House. \u201cWarren coming to Lawrence demonstrates the commitment she has to the middle class.\u201d\n\nInstead of the polyglot immigrant community that existed in 1912, Lawrence today is dominated by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and emigres from Puerto Rico. The city, which is nearly three-quarters Latino in a state that is roughly three-quarters white, has struggled. A 2014 story in Boston Magazine labeled it \u201cThe City of the Damned,\u201d documenting a state takeover of the city\u2019s failing public schools, a high crime rate and the corruption investigations plaguing its then-mayor, William Lantigua.\n\nIt has also become a favorite target of Republican attacks. In a 2018 speech in New Hampshire, Trump blamed Lawrence and Boston by name for the deadly opioid epidemic ravaging New England. Chris Sununu, New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor, has used similar rhetoric. Most famously, former Maine Gov. Paul LePage blamed his state\u2019s problems with fentanyl on black and Latino people from Lawrence and nearby Lowell.\n\nMatias said things are improving in the city, with better schools and less crime under new mayor Daniel Rivera, who spoke before Warren. A small number of biotech and other firms have moved into the massive mill buildings along the river, but the city remains one of the poorest in the state.\n\nLawrence\u2019s large Latino population \u2015 Trump signaled it out because of its status as sanctuary city where local police don\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2015 also provides Warren with an opportunity to show her appeal to voters of color. Massachusetts\u2019 limited number of black and Latino voters means Warren still needs to show she can appeal to voters outside her core base of white progressives.\n\nAfter making her way onstage to Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201c9 to 5,\u201d Warren ticked off a host of policy priorities \u2015 from making it easier to join a union to outlawing gerrymandering to criminal justice reform, but repeatedly returned to her core message of rebuilding the middle class, which she emphasized could appeal to voters across the socioeconomic spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe come from different backgrounds, different religions, different languages, different experiences,\u201d she told the crowd of roughly 3,500 people who braved freezing temperatures to attend the rally. \u201cWe feel the urgency of this moment in different ways. But today, we come together, ready to raise our voices until this fight is won.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Warren is set to travel to New Hampshire and then Iowa this weekend, and she has trips to South Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and California planned for the coming weeks.\n\nRepublicans responded to Warren\u2019s campaign launch by focusing on the controversy over the senator\u2019s claims to Native American ancestry, which gained new steam this week after The Washington Post reported she identified as Native American on a form filed with the Texas State Bar.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has already been exposed as a fraud by the Native Americans she impersonated and disrespected to advance her professional career, and the people of Massachusetts she deceived to get elected,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nBut there is no evidence Warren\u2019s ancestry claims helped her advance her career, and little evidence it will significantly hamper her in the Democratic primary.

CEO Jeff Bezos said in a release the company had listened to its critics.\n\nPreviously:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 The nation\u2019s second-largest employer is raising wages in response to outside pressure and advocacy from its workforce, according to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nFor several weeks Sanders has been criticizing Amazon for low pay at its warehouses, even introducing legislation that would tax the company for what its workers receive in food stamp and Medicaid benefits.\n\nIn August, Sanders solicited testimonials from Amazon warehouse workers about low pay, which he showcased on his website and used to promote his legislation. Workers in several Amazon facilities told The Washington Post last week that they had received raises.\n\nSanders declined to take responsibility for the change, saying it was the workers who deserved credit for the raises.\n\n\u201cI think the workers have stood up and fought back,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cWhat we have done is call attention to the fact that it is a disgrace that the wealthiest person in this country and in this world are paying wages so low that workers are forced to go on food stamps and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAmazon CEO Jff Bezos is worth more than $160 billion, making him the wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes. Sanders titled his legislation \u2015 which is a messaging bill that has little support and no chance of becoming law \u2015 the Stop BEZOS Act. The purpose of the legislation is to shame the company for paying some of its workers so little they are poor enough to qualify for welfare benefits.\n\n\u201cI think the pressure is building not only on Bezos and Amazon but every other employer in America: Pay your workers a living wage, at least 15 bucks an hour,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWith more than half a million workers, only Walmart is a larger employer in the United States. The median Amazon employee makes $28,446 annually, according to the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Excluding part-timers and workers in other countries brings the median above $34,000, the firm has said.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cfulfillment center\u201d employees pack the boxes that arrive on consumers\u2019 doorsteps.

(Low unemployment, at least theoretically, should also be putting upward pressure on wages, as there should be fewer workers desperate for jobs.)\n\nOne Amazon worker at a fulfillment center in Orlando \u2015 whose contact information Sanders\u2019 office provided to HuffPost \u2015 said he thought his 50-cent raise he received had something to do with the pressure. The Orlando facility had just opened so he didn\u2019t understand why the company would already be adjusting wages for workers who\u2019d only been on the job a few weeks.\n\nThe worker said his pay increased from $11.25 per hour to $11.50. He likes his job, he said, but resented the company\u2019s claim in an all-hands meeting a few weeks ago that factoring in stock awards means his hourly pay is actually $15.\n\n\u201cI knew it was a low-wage job when I took it,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t piss on my leg and call it rain.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-running-2020-warren-harris-gillibrand-gabbard_us_5c50c3c7e4b0f43e410bea6d": "For those who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, it was obvious that sexism played a role in how her candidacy was received. Pundits complained about her facial expressions, her \u201cshrill\u201d tone and her alleged penchant for \u201cshouting\u201d\u2014 something that Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders also did plenty of, with much less scrutiny.\n\n\u201cSmile. You just had a big night,\u201d Joe Scarborough tweeted condescendingly to Clinton at the end of a major primary night in March. Much of the media cast her as unlikable, inauthentic and untrustworthy. Often, these assessments came down to people\u2019s gut feelings rather than tangible concerns about her experience or policies.\n\nWhat was especially frustrating to Clinton supporters, however, was that her position as the one and only woman in the race made this sexism harder to call out \u2014 because sexist criticism of Clinton could easily be ascribed to her flaws as an individual, without taking into account the gender biases that influence public perception.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge with having only one ... is that it is easy to discount sexism in coverage, sexism from voters, sexism in the ways we view the candidates, to chalk that up to, well, that\u2019s Hillary,\u201d Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for EMILY\u2019s List and former deputy communications director for the Clinton campaign, told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018there\u2019s something about her I just don\u2019t like.\u2019 It\u2019s the \u2018I would support a woman, just not this one.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAcross the country, people of every political persuasion \u2014 men, women, millennials, baby boomers \u2014 told me they were eager for a woman president, just not this woman,\u201d Rolling Stone reporter Janet Reitman wrote the September before the election. And actress Susan Sarandon, who had backed Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary, told the BBC that she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Clinton, because she \u201cwant[ed] the right woman.\u201d\n\nEven Trump tapped into the refrain that it wasn\u2019t about women in general, just this woman. In fact, he cherished women! No one respected women more than him! \u201cI want to see a woman become president, but it can\u2019t be her. She\u2019s a disaster. She\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Trump told a crowd about Clinton in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in July 2016.\n\nRick Wilking / Reuters Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 2016.\n\nIf anything, what the field needed was more women, Rebecca Traister suggested in The New Republic back in 2014, lamenting the fact that several highly qualified women were apparently clearing the lane for Clinton\u2019s bid. \u201cWarren, Gillibrand, and Klobuchar would dramatically improve the tenor and content of political discourse on the left\u201d by running against Clinton, she argued, \u201cbecause ... women challenging each other, in presidential and other races ... alleviates the pressure of only-ness.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to 2019, and two of the women Traister identified, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), have launched serious presidential campaigns, along with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is also reportedly mulling over a bid.\n\nThese women span the ideological spectrum of the Democratic Party \u2014 and just maybe in 2020, the sheer number of them out on the campaign trail and on the debate stage, expressing a variety of political views, even arguing with each other while displaying a variety of demeanors, will force voters to look at women politicians as individual candidates, rather than as avatars for 52 percent of the population.\n\n\u201cJust having one, that one person bears all the representational weight,\u201d Traister said when Stephen Colbert recently asked if it was a good thing to have several women in the running for the Democratic nomination. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re talking about massive populations that have been left out of these structures, that\u2019s too much pressure for one candidate to bear.\u201d\n\nMaybe in 2020, the sheer number of women out on the campaign trail and on the debate stage, expressing a variety of political views, even arguing with each other while displaying a variety of demeanors, will force voters to look at women politicians as individual candidates, rather than as avatars for 52 percent of the population.\n\nA vigorous battle between multiple Democratic women candidates might also allow the country to change its collective vision of what \u201cpresidential\u201d looks like. When then-Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) explored a presidential run 1987, she kept running into a particular line of criticism. People felt she was qualified and personable and highly knowledgeable, but she just didn\u2019t have that \u2026presidential vibe.\n\n\u201cI used to have people say to me, \u2018I like everything about you but you don\u2019t sound like the others, you don\u2019t look like the others,\u2019\u201d Schroeder recently told HuffPost. \u201c\u2018The problem is, you don\u2019t look presidential.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem that when women seek the highest political offices, they are portrayed as too ambitious, too ruthless, less likable. Clinton, for example, was always most popular when she was settled into a role (like when she was a New York senator or secretary of state) or while assisting a more powerful man in some capacity (like when she was first lady... or secretary of state). When she left Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet in 2013, she was the most popular politician in the country, with an approval rating of 69 percent. But when she dared to ask for more power, her approval ratings plummeted. In February 2016, in the midst of her run for president, her approval rating hovered just above 40 percent.\n\nWhen more than one woman steps up and asks for power, it becomes harder to dismiss sexist critiques of and reactions to that ambition. As the first woman to officially announce her candidacy, Warren\u2019s likability was quickly called into question. (Ironically, during the 2016 election, many had declared that Warren would be the natural antidote to Clinton\u2019s unlikability.) \u201cI\u2019ll Say It. Elizabeth Warren Isn\u2019t Likeable,\u201d declared Matt Lewis in The Daily Beast. \u201cHow does Warren avoid a Clinton redux \u2014 written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?\u201d asked Politico. \u201cIs Elizabeth Warren Actually \u2018Unlikeable\u2019\u201d? echoed Vanity Fair.\n\nBut now that there are at least four women in the race, the knee-jerk critiques seem to have \u2015 at least temporarily \u2015 slowed. The media promptly denounced a (favorable) comment about Gillibrand\u2019s likability at her first post-announcement press event. And Harris\u2019 announcement wasn\u2019t followed in the press by any caveats about her ambition or likability. (Progress!)\n\nIt remains to be seen how gender will play out in the Democratic primary. There is still a fear among women who work in the political sphere that the media may try to frame healthy debate between the female candidates as some sort of \u201ccat fight.\u201d And Reynolds told HuffPost that EMILY\u2019s List has already received questions about whether the women running will simply cannibalize each other\u2019s votes.\n\nIf a woman does end up facing off against Trump in the general election, there is certainly still a chance that sexism could actively hurt her chances at defeating him. After all, his brazen toxic masculinity is undoubtedly a part of his appeal to his base. But these difficult-to-navigate transitional moments in history are a necessary part of increasing representation in the long run. We will not create a wider vision of what a president could look like and who should be allowed to desire that role until more individuals who fall outside of that mold step up and run.\n\n\u201cWe [at EMILY\u2019s List] are firm believers [that] every woman [who] runs makes it easier for the next woman,\u201d said Reynolds, \u201cin part because it changes the way we look at candidates.\u201d\n\nAnd because it changes what \u201ccandidate\u201d looks like.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-democrats-battle-for-black-voters-in-south-carolina-new-york-and-dc_us_5c464024e4b027c3bbc480dd": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2015 The battle for black voters in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary has begun in earnest, a sign of how crucial candidates and strategists view the bloc to a successful campaign.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, two potential candidates, spoke at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally organized by the NAACP outside the statehouse here. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden all spoke at Washington, D.C., events sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. And Sen.

It\u2019s about winning the nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe voters that will determine the next primary winner are going to be African-American women,\u201d said former South Carolina state legislator Bakari Sellers, expressing a sentiment widely shared by Democratic operatives nationally.\n\nAfter both President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination with a coalition heavy on African-American voters, the new conventional wisdom says the candidate with the most success among black voters \u2015 especially black women, who made up 37 percent of the 2016 primary vote, according to exit polling \u2015 has the simplest path to victory.\n\nSean Rayford via Getty Images Sen.

Following her 2020 campaign announcement Monday morning, Harris is scheduled to visit the state Friday. (Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is set to make a trip here Wednesday.)\n\nThe challenge with black voters may be greatest for Sanders, who faltered here in 2016 after shocking Clinton with a victory in New Hampshire. Since then, Sanders and his allies have worked assiduously to woo black voters, and he\u2019s begun to mention racial discrimination more in his stump speech, bluntly calling Trump a \u201cracist\u201d during his speech here. The 77-year-old Vermonter, who famously dislikes discussing his biography, mentioned he traveled to Washington as a college student and heard King deliver his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\n\u201cLet us not forget that the title of that march was for Jobs and Freedom,\u201d Sanders said at the rally, invoking the organizers\u2019 call for an increased minimum wage, a federal job guarantee and more affordable housing. \u201cRacial equality must be central to combating economic inequality if we are to build an economy that works for all of us.\u201d\n\nSanders drew loud applause as he tied his push for progressive policies, such as free college tuition, to the black community, noting African-Americans in particular struggle with student loan debt. Sanders also called for automatic voter registration for every American and \u201cmaking the right to vote a constitutional right,\u201d as well as ending the war on drugs, minimum sentences and private prisons.\n\nBishop Roderick Sumpter, a 52-year-old from St. Stevens, said his impression of Sanders improved after seeing him at the rally and a subsequent town hall.\n\n\u201cIt makes a difference seeing the person talk than looking at them on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can really feel the impression and see the emotion \u2015 that it\u2019s not phony. It\u2019s for real.\n\nStill, operatives in the state remain skeptical of Sanders\u2019 chances.\n\n\u201cI would expect him [Bernie Sanders] to do far worse this year,\u201d said Brady Quirk-Garvan, the chairman of the Charleston Democratic Party. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a strong coalition of Sanders supporters in the state, and I think that number dwindles when you\u2019ve got other progressives in the race.\u201d\n\nBooker drew a more subdued response. Speaking less in specifics and more of embracing \u201ccourageous empathy\u201d and \u201cspiritual dissatisfaction,\u201d Booker raised his voice as he called on the crowd to be agents of change themselves.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment in America where we don\u2019t just celebrate King\u2019s holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recommit ourselves to be the agents of change.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) not only announced her bid for president on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, she held her first news conference at Howard University, the historically black university in Washington, D.C., that she attended.\n\nHarris signaled her intent to aggressively woo black voters not only by launching her campaign on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and invoking Chisholm, but also by holding her first news conference at Howard, the historically black university where she went to college.\n\nIn a post on Medium explaining why she was running, Harris said she wanted to live in an America \u201cwhere black women aren\u2019t three to four times more likely to die in childbirth than white women. A country where for-profit prison businesses \u2014 a billion-dollar industry \u2014 are a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nBut when Harris \u2015 who has a Jamaican-born father and an Indian-born mother \u2015 was asked at Howard how she identified herself, she gently dodged the question.\n\n\u201cI identify as a proud American,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nBiden, who is still debating whether to run, spent the day in Washington speaking at an event organized by Sharpton.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) latest policy idea seems laudable at first glance: Penalize big corporations when their workers tap public benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, to get by.\n\nUnveiled this week and unabashedly aimed at Amazon and its wildly wealthy CEO, Jeff Bezos, Sanders\u2019 Stop BEZOS Act would slap a 100 percent tax on companies with 500 or more workers until the government recovers the monetary value of all the social welfare used by their workers: Medicaid, food stamps, even school lunch subsidies. For instance, for every dollar an employee receives in food stamp benefits, the company would pay an extra dollar in taxes.\n\nThe idea is to shame some of the country\u2019s largest and most successful companies for paying workers so poorly that they have to rely on government aid.\n\nBut the bill doesn\u2019t just shame companies, it spreads that shame to the very idea of social welfare by demonizing benefits, economists say. That\u2019s a play usually reserved for Republicans and conservatives, who love to bang the drum against the nation\u2019s \u201ctakers.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which doesn\u2019t stand much chance of going anywhere, could give big companies a reason not to hire those who get benefits, a majority of whom are parents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ham-fisted,\u201d Betsey Stevenson, a labor economist at the University of Michigan who served on the Obama administration\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told HuffPost.\n\nIf the goal is to get companies to pay higher wages, this won\u2019t do it, added Stevenson, who specializes in examining how public policy affects the labor market.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Sanders dismissed the criticism.\n\n\u201cWe have thousands of workers working for an extremely profitable corporation owned by the wealthiest person in this country who are making wages so low they are forced to go on public assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we are asking of Mr. Bezos is pay your workers a living wage.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s already stigma in the United States surrounding food stamps and other social safety benefits. Some Americans won\u2019t apply for food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to avoid the shame involved, Stevenson said.\n\nYet the public safety net offers a real benefit to American workers. Single parents, in particular, rely on Medicaid and monthly food benefits in order to raise children in a country that offers little other supports to families (such as subsidized day care or parental leave). Nearly 70 percent of food stamp benefits go to households with children.\n\nJoshua Roberts / Reuters Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is targeted in the proposed legislation.\n\nThough Sanders\u2019 proposal includes a provision that blocks employers from asking applicants if they are on public benefits, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop a company from profiling workers or not hiring those who seem likely to use benefits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in its blog post.\n\n\u201cIn addition, some employers might pressure employees not to sign up for Medicaid or other benefits,\u201d CBPP\u2019s Robert Greenstein, Sharon Parrott and Chye-Ching Huang wrote. \u201cAnd elements of the business community would likely lobby policymakers to reduce their tax bills by restricting eligibility and benefits for core low-income programs, which would be equivalent to a corporate tax cut.\u201d\n\nWarren Gunnels, Sanders\u2019 policy director, suggested on Twitter that the CBPP did its analysis to please Walmart, which has donated to the nonprofit. In a statement Friday, CBPP spokeswoman Shannon Buckingham said Gunnels\u2019 charge is false and pointed out that many other analysts outside of the organization share its view.\n\n\u201cThe Center did not use any Walmart Foundation funding for this analysis,\u201d Buckingham said. \u201cMoreover, our analysis calls for policies that require Walmart and other corporations to raise wages, provide paid leave, and pay more in corporate taxes \u2015 policies many corporations would find unattractive.\u201d\n\nWelfare recipients in the U.S. are often subject to work requirements, so if you get food stamps or Medicaid, in some states you also must work a certain amount per week. This bill, by disincentivizing hiring such workers, would make it even harder for them to land a job, thus causing more of them to lose benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfair. Recipients would end up in a situation where there is a work requirement and employers are told that they\u2019ll be penalized for hiring them,\u201d Stevenson said.\n\nSanders rejected the idea that employers would discriminate against poor applicants, suggesting reasonable pay itself would solve the problem.\n\n\u201cIf you pay people a living wage, they will have an adequate income,\u201d he said.\n\nEven though the bill stands little chance of becoming law, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK that the policy idea is flawed, Baker told HuffPost last week. When you create an economic policy, you want to make sure it\u2019s a good, effective idea, he said.\n\n\u201cAmazon has a history of treating workers badly, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t likely going to change that.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-amazon_us_5b8eecade4b0511db3dcfd55": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced legislation Wednesday that would tax companies like Walmart and Amazon for every dollar their workers receive in government food or health care benefits.\n\nThe bill isn\u2019t really about collecting funds for food stamps or Medicaid \u2015 it\u2019s about making a spectacle of the low pay and bad working conditions at profitable businesses.\n\n\u201cA company like Amazon, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest person in the world, who is worth about $150 billion, whose wealth is increasing by $225 million every single day \u2015 the American people should not have to subsidize Mr. Bezos,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost in an interview. \u201cHe should pay his workers a living wage.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon of large firms leaving their workers poor enough to qualify for social safety net benefits has drawn attention from liberal policymakers since at least 2004, when congressional Democrats used payroll data to find out how many people who worked at Walmart stores also received Medicaid benefits, which are generally available to people with low incomes.\n\n\u201cWhen low wages leave Walmart workers unable to afford the necessities of life, taxpayers pick up the tab,\u201d Democrats said in a 2013 version of their report, which found that low pay at Walmart stores in Wisconsin alone potentially cost the government nearly $1 million in safety net benefits. At that point, Democrats were hoping the report would bolster the case to raise the minimum wage.\n\nSanders has approached the issue from a different angle. His legislation \u2015 titled Stop Bad Employers By Zeroing Out Subsidies, or BEZOS Act \u2015 would give employers a choice: Either pay better or pay the government back for what your workers receive in Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, housing subsidies and school meals from the National School Lunch Program.\n\nSanders has seized on an April report from The Intercept and the New Food Economy that found that large numbers of Amazon workers get SNAP benefits in several states, including one-third of its employees in Arizona. (His office has also cited a 2015 report by the University of California, Berkeley, Labor Center finding that low wages cost the government more than $150 billion annually in public benefits.)\n\nBefore the introduction of his bill, Sanders feuded with Amazon over its pay practices.\n\nUsing information from Amazon\u2019s own disclosure to investors, Sanders pointed out that the median annual pay for an Amazon employee is only $28,446 \u2015 9 percent below the industry average for a material moving worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last week the company responded in a blog post, arguing that its own number is misleading because it includes part-time workers; its median annual pay for a full-time U.S. employee is $34,123, which is slightly above the industry average.\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t provided a ton of detail about its workforce. In its most recent financial disclosure, the company said it had 566,000 employees at the end of 2017, but it didn\u2019t say how many of those workers are full time. The company also said its employment levels \u201cfluctuate due to seasonal factors\u201d and that it uses temporary staffing firms.\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Lindsay Campbell said most of the company\u2019s workers are regular full-time employees most of the time.\n\n\u201cThroughout the year on average, nearly 90 percent of associates across the company\u2019s U.S. fulfillment network are regular employees who receive full benefits and stock options,\u201d Campbell said in an email.\n\nThe Sanders bill would tax businesses for workers receiving benefits regardless of whether the workers are full or part time. He said he suspected that, like Walmart, Amazon used part-timers to avoid having to pay for health and retirement benefits. Labor advocacy groups have accused Walmart of increasing its use of part-time workers as a way of saving money and said that a majority of the company\u2019s part-time workers would rather work full time. (Walmart also has a habit of leaving part-time employees out of the salary data it releases to the public, almost certainly because including them would drive down the pay averages.)\n\n\u201cWhat we believe is that half of the employees who work for Amazon have salaries of less than $28,000 a year,\u201d Sanders said in response to a question about Amazon\u2019s defense that its part-timers pull down its annual salary data. \u201cWhat I also know is, in the case of Walmart, is many of those workers are working 29 hours per week precisely in order to not be able to get benefits that they would get if they worked more than 30 hours per week.\u201d\n\nAnd while Amazon touts the number of jobs it created last year, it\u2019s important to remember that such job growth doesn\u2019t occur in a vacuum. Much of that has come at the expense of older brick-and-mortar retailers that can\u2019t match Amazon on price and shipping speed. Some Amazon critics have urged cities to reject proposals for Amazon fulfillment centers, arguing they would ultimately undermine local retail.\n\nThe Sanders proposal is unlikely to become law. The House and Senate are currently debating a reauthorization of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps nearly 40 million Americans buy food each month, but the two chambers have already voted on their respective versions of the legislation and are currently negotiating a final version.\n\nSanders complains that food stamps \u201csubsidize\u201d big companies, but basic economic theory would say the opposite is true \u2015 that helping poor people survive without work income makes them less likely to take bad jobs. In response to the UC Berkeley study, for instance, one economist pointed out that SNAP benefits tend to decrease the labor supply, which, if anything, would put upward pressure on wages. \u201cAnd if [food stamps] don\u2019t lower wages, they can\u2019t be thought of as subsidies to low wage employers,\u201d University of Massachusetts Amherst professor Arindrajit Dube wrote in 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s usually Republicans, not Democrats, who are mad that too many Americans receive SNAP benefits. During the food stamp debate, Republicans have continuously complained that businesses in their districts can\u2019t find enough people willing to work. When it endorsed the House version of the food stamp bill, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the proposed stricter work requirements would be \u201clikely to increase the size of the labor force\u201d \u2015 in other words, make more people willing to take jobs at whatever wage the firms feel like paying.\n\nAnd a paper by the White House Council of Economic Advisers pointed to past research suggesting that when food stamps were first introduced in the 1960s and \u201970s, work hours among female heads of households in some areas fell by 50 percent.\n\nA better example of a policy that subsidizes employers would be the Earned Income Tax Credit, which pays benefits annually based on the amount a taxpayer has earned in a year. Research has suggested that the program reduces wages by making people more willing to accept lower pay, knowing they\u2019ll eventually get a bonus from the government.\n\nMatt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing think tank the People\u2019s Policy Project, argues that people should take Sanders and others seriously, but not literally, when they agitate against a company whose workers receive welfare benefits.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-presidential-run-defends-progressive-record_us_5c54c6a0e4b09293b20425d1": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2015 Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who announced his presidential candidacy on Friday morning, defended his record against criticism from the left later in the day during a news conference outside of his home.\n\nBooker calmly fielded questions about how he would respond to hypothetical attacks from President Donald Trump about Booker\u2019s ties to Wall Street, the perception that he is \u201ctoo corporate\u201d and his support for public charter schools at a moment of resurgent teachers union militancy.\n\nRather than adopt the populist rhetoric of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Booker defended his work combating predatory financial practices, including exploitative lending to low-income homeowners in Newark, and vowed that he would continue to stand up to \u201cbad actors\u201d in corporate America whose practices harm ordinary people.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows my history knows my history of standing up for people who have been hurt by bad actors,\u201d he said.\n\nBooker did not deny supporting public charter schools. It would have been difficult for him to do so: He spoke at a rally co-sponsored by a charter school system in New Orleans on Jan. 18, at a time when Los Angeles schoolteachers were on strike in part over the growth of charter schools there.\n\nWithout once saying the word \u201ccharter,\u201d Booker affirmed, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have one-size-fits-all education. Local leaders should be able to decide what works best for them.\u201d\n\nInstead, he cast himself as a champion of higher public school teacher pay and better school funding that would enable more hiring of teachers, counselors and mental health professionals. One way he suggested to address the issue is by reforming the tax code so young stockbrokers, who may benefit from the carried-interest loophole or the lower tax rate on capital gains, don\u2019t pay a lower tax rate than teachers.\n\n\u201cOur teachers are ridiculously underpaid in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at this in an economic analysis, they are the professionals who contribute the most to a thriving American economy. And we cannot continue to devalue one of the greatest professions in our country, which is public school teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to run the boldest pro-public school teacher campaign there is, which is how I ran the city of Newark,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, during a discussion of health care, Booker avoided a pitfall encountered by a fellow presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), earlier this week.\n\nHarris declared at a CNN town hall in Iowa on Monday that she supported a Medicare-for-all system that included \u201cget[ting] rid\u201d of private health insurance. But by Tuesday, under fire from Republicans, Harris\u2019 staff was clarifying that while Medicare for all was her preferred policy, she was open to multiple paths to universal coverage.\n\nBooker, like Harris, is a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 September 2017 legislation replacing all but supplemental private insurance with one public federal program.\n\nOn Friday, however, when a reporter asked Booker if he would eliminate \u201cprivate health care\u201d \u2015 seemingly referring to insurance, not the actual medical care \u2015 the New Jersey senator took a different tack.\n\nWithout elaborating further, he responded, \u201cEven countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the below-freezing temperatures, Booker\u2019s decision to address reporters outside his Newark home in a working-class neighborhood provided an opportunity to showcase his status as a hometown favorite. (Booker served as mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014.)\n\nWhen Narcissa Quito, a neighbor of Booker\u2019s from across the street, noticed the news conference, she opened up her window, waved and called out to him frantically.\n\nBooker, who was in the middle of his answer to the question on charter schools and public education, smiled, calling back, \u201cHermana!\u201d\n\n\u201cHola! Como estas?\u201d he continued in Spanish. \u201cA la victoria!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d she replied in English. (In a follow-up interview, Quito, who immigrated from Ecuador more than 30 years ago, confirmed that she is already an enthusiastic backer of his bid.)\n\nBooker had ample opportunity to showcase his facility with policy details, including on criminal justice and immigration reform, causes he has long championed.\n\nHe previewed a presidential run that is likely to focus on uplift, appealing to American \u201cdecency and goodness\u201d to overcome the divisiveness that has consumed the country under Trump.\n\nPressed on whether he was up for the task of taking on Trump, given his focus on \u201clove\u201d as a driving force in American politics, Booker expounded on the compassion of white lawyers who helped his parents overcome discrimination in the housing market and other civil rights advocates who helped move the country forward.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politicians-react-trump-national-emergency_n_5c66e52fe4b01757c36b1b34": "Trump on Thursday said he would approve Congress\u2019 spending bill, which includes $1.375 billion for border barriers, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded.

She is among more than a dozen Democratic senators who in, in late 2017, co-sponsored Medicare for All legislation from Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and longtime champion of the idea.\n\nHarris reiterated that support just a few weeks ago, in an op-ed for The New York Times.\n\nBut the Medicare for All Act of 2017, as the legislation is formally called, envisions some dramatic changes to the U.S. health care system \u2015 including a prohibition on private insurance, except for coverage of services outside the scope of the new government plan.\n\nThe new plan would pay for just about every medically necessary service, so that wouldn\u2019t leave much of a role, if any, for private coverage.\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t been clear whether all of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, several of whom are running for president or at least thinking about it, really want to see such a wholesale change happen \u2015 or whether their support of the Sanders proposal was simply a way of signaling support for universal health care, which can take many forms and which can include a prominent role for private insurers.\n\nCalling for Medicare for All, Kamala Harris says of private insurance: \u201dLet\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d pic.twitter.com/xT2I5IZDfT \u2014 Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) January 29, 2019\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper asked Harris about this, following an audience question on health care. \u201cFor people out there who like their insurance,\u201d Tapper asked, \u201cthey don\u2019t get to keep it?\u201d\n\nHarris didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cThe idea is that everybody gets access to medical care,\u201d she said, \u201cand you don\u2019t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho of us has not had that situation, where you\u2019ve got to wait for approval and the doctor says well, I\u2019m not sure whether your insurance company is going to cover this,\u201d Harris went on to say. \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\nThe new interest in Medicare for All, which has become a top priority for progressive politicians and activists, is a byproduct of several factors \u2015 among them, frustration that the Affordable Care Act, which for all of its success at expanding access to care, has left so many Americans still struggling to pay their medical bills.\n\nMedicare for All holds out the promise of addressing this problem, and finally reaching the elusive goal of universal coverage, by automatically enrolling everybody in the government plan and then using regulation to set prices for doctors, hospitals, and the rest of the health care industry. Typically, such proposals envision people paying for coverage entirely through taxes or income-related premiums, with little or no co-payments, deductibles, and other forms of cost-sharing.\n\nSuch a system would likely be a lot easier for patients to use, as Harris suggested, and a lot more straightforward for the providers of health care, as well, because they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about billing so many different insurers. In countries like Sweden and Taiwan, such systems deliver quality care to all residents, at a fraction of what the U.S. spends.\n\nBut the transition to the new system could be difficult, depending on the final policy details of legislation. One key factor is how well the new plan would pay doctors and hospitals, and whether they would react by reducing their capacity to see patients.\n\nWhatever the actual merits of the switch away from private insurance, surveys suggest that many Americans who have decent coverage now are nervous about changes. Just last week, a poll from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that support for a support for a Medicare for All system dropped dramatically when people learned that it would mean giving up existing insurance, although that was just one of several questions the pollsters tested.\n\nThat political vulnerability is one reason some other Democrats have stopped short of endorsing measures like the Sanders bill and instead advocated for schemes that envision less dramatic transformations \u2015 or, at least, much slower ones.\n\nSome of their plans would simply open up existing public programs to new groups of people. An example is legislation co-sponsored by Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan that would allow people 55 and older to sign up for Medicare.\n\nOther proposals envision creating a whole new government-run plan, more similar to the one in the Sanders bill, while still allowing employers to continue offering coverage to employees \u2015 and then giving employees the option of sticking with the company plan or buying into the new public program. A pair of House Democrats, Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut and Jan Schakowsky from Illinois, have put forward such a bill.\n\nOf course, these proposals, like Medicare for All, have policy downsides to go with their upsides, and political weaknesses to go with their strengths.\n\nBack in December, right after the Times op-ed, a senior aide to Harris told HuffPost that she doesn\u2019t oppose more incremental proposals, noting that Harris has also co-sponsored a few of them. The same aide said Harris is open to different ways of achieving universal coverage.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All is her preferred plan but she is also open to looking at others that achieve the same principle where health care is a right for all,\u201d the Harris staffer said. \u201cWhat she believes is that we need is a system where health care is guaranteed to every American and she will continue to look at proposals that achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nBut, the aide said, Harris worked with Sanders on crafting the 2017 bill \u2015 and \u201cbelieves it is the best solution.\u201d\n\nI mean, seriously, only in Washington is decrying insurance companies' paperwork, approvals, and delays so that EVERYONE GETS INSURANCE COVERAGE considered controversial or risky. \u2014 Ian Sams (@IanSams) January 29, 2019\n\nAnd on Monday night, following the CNN forum, Ian Sams, who is national press secretary for the Harris campaign, wrote a pair of tweets about the candidate\u2019s comments.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-south-carolina_us_5c48fb5fe4b0e1872d40cc50": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2015 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wasted little time inside the jam-packed gymnasium in South Carolina\u2019s capital Wednesday night laying out the stakes here come presidential primary season next year.\n\n\u201cThese are hard times for our country. These are really difficult times,\u201d Warren said early on. \u201cAnd the direction we go in from here, in no small part, is going to be determined by people in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe fourth state to hold a Democratic nominating contest \u2015 and the first with a significant black population \u2015 South Carolina has developed into a growing area of focus among 2020 presidential hopefuls, who see it as a key to gaining momentum heading into other Southern primaries.\n\nWarren is the third presidential hopeful in as many days to touch down in South Carolina\u2019s capital \u2015 the first time she has done so since she announced she was forming a committee to explore running for president. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke Tuesday to a packed audience at a local historically black college before heading to an event in North Charleston. The day before, Sanders and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) marched together to the State House, where they each spoke as part of the city\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day events. Later this week, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is scheduled to attend a fundraiser for the local chapter of her college sorority at the state fairgrounds. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) both have plans to visit the state soon as well.\n\n\u201cThe degree of attention being given to this state for this presidential race? It\u2019s night and day from 2016,\u201d said Justin Bamberg, a state representative who backed Sanders in the last presidential primary.\n\nI\u2019m at Columbia College in South Carolina, where @SenWarren is answering questions. 980 people here, per aide. pic.twitter.com/iljPNXcxjD \u2014 maxwell (@maxwellstrachan) January 24, 2019\n\nDuring the Wednesday night event at Columbia College, Warren received loud applause when she proclaimed that she supports strong unions and overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling.\n\nShe also declared that health care is a \u201cbasic human right,\u201d took a shot at Goldman Sachs for what she described as a $250 million \u201cpre-bribe\u201d to former Trump adviser Gary Cohn, and declared that \u201cit should not be harder to vote in America than it is to buy a gun.\u201d\n\nWhen a man in the audience told Warren he had grown disenchanted with the Democratic Party because of what he saw as its corporatization and close ties with Wall Street, Warren replied, \u201cWall Street is not happy about me.\u201d\n\nBut she also spent more than two minutes connecting the country\u2019s history of racist redlining policies to the current wealth disparity between white and black families. \u201cHere in America, what the federal government decided to do is subsidize home buying,\u201d Warren, said, \u201cfor white people, but not for black people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat gap between white homeownership and black homeownership that was 27 points back when discrimination was legal? Today is 31 points,\u201d Warren continued, causing audible gasps in the audience. \u201cThat\u2019s not an America that\u2019s working for everybody.\u201d\n\nSecuring victory in South Carolina will require winning over the state\u2019s black population, which holds enormous power in Democratic politics here. According to exit polls, black women alone made up 37 percent of the state\u2019s Democratic primary voters in 2016, and black men comprised an additional 24 percent.\n\nSanders, who got shellacked by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 South Carolina primary, tweaked his typical stump speech this week to focus more deeply on struggles specific to black Americans. At the historically black Benedict College on Tuesday, he received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic student body.\n\nNationally, Warren has similarly attempted to better appeal to black voters and try to avoid some of Sanders\u2019 stumbles in 2016. In a New Year\u2019s Eve video announcing her exploratory committee, she stated that \u201cfamilies of color face a path that is [even] steeper and rockier\u201d than do white families. She has forged bonds with the likes of Bernice King, MLK\u2019s youngest daughter, and twice spoke at historically black colleges in 2018 \u2015 first at Dillard University in New Orleans, where she called the country\u2019s criminal justice system \u201cracist.\u201d Then last month at Morgan State University in Baltimore, where she said during a commencement address that the U.S. government had \u201csystematically discriminated against black people in this country.\u201d\n\nAbout 980 people attended the event Wednesday night, according to a Warren aide. And attendees brought handmade signs that included messages like \u201cPersist,\u201d \u201cWe will end corruption\u201d and \u201cFight.\u201d\n\nBut the audience was noticeably whiter than at the week\u2019s previous political events. Considering the unquestionable significance of the black vote in South Carolina, Warren\u2019s decision to pick a predominantly white college (as of 2017) for her first stop in South Carolina this year.\n\n\u201c[It is] certainly something that has been talked about,\u201d said Brady Quirk-Garvan, chairman of the Charleston County Democratic Party. Another former elected official who did not want to be named agreed there had been chatter.\n\nBut Trav Robertson, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said before Warren\u2019s event on Wednesday that he thought such talk was \u201coverly critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she runs for president, she\u2019s going to have a lot of opportunities to visit historically black colleges in South Carolina,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re all just going on first dates with some of these folks.\u201d\n\nErika Brooks, 46, didn\u2019t exactly know what to expect when she attended Warren\u2019s event. The African-American single mother required transplant surgery in 2017, which left her with medical debt on top of her student loan debt.\n\n\u201cI was in my hospital bed recovering from my surgery, had been in a coma for 21 days, and the Student Loan Corp. was like, pay us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now that I have a second chance in life, I have debt. It took $1.5 million to transplant me.\u201d\n\nEven if she somehow digs herself out of the financial hole, she worries what will come after. \u201cWhen I get to be 50, 60, what about retirement?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seriously disappointed in America,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was losing faith, and I wanted to hear that someone cared, someone understood, someone sees the problems that everyday people are facing.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Warren\u2019s staff and operation have been working aggressively to prove they are taking Brooks\u2019 state seriously, according to Quirk-Garvan. \u201cThe senator herself has called me and spent time chatting with me. She made it abundantly clear to me that she\u2019s not writing off this state and she intends to compete pretty vigorously in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nBrian Fallon, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said that dedication has been clear at the national level as well. \u201cTheir political operation has been among the best in terms of making up call sheets for her and orchestrating all the little touches that mean a lot to the people that are on the receiving end of those calls.\u201d\n\nBut Boyd Brown, a former member of the Democratic National Committee and South Carolina House of Representatives who is now working on the \u201cDraft Beto\u201d movement, said Warren has struggled to pull Democrats working within South Carolina\u2019s political structure to her side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to numerous people she\u2019s reached out to in South Carolina, and all of them have pretty much given her the same response: Thanks, but no thanks,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe work Warren has ahead of her in South Carolina was clear at Benedict College, where Sanders was speaking Tuesday.

The surprise change in policy led to the resignation of several top officials, including former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, as well as vocal opposition from some of the president\u2019s biggest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhile Trump ultimately decided to delay the pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria for several months to ensure a slow and orderly withdrawal, the move failed to quell concern from top Republicans in Congress.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) introduced an amendment last week that expressed the sense of the chamber that the U.S. \u201cfaces continuing threats from terrorist groups operating in Syria and Afghanistan\u201d and that the \u201cprecipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.\u201d\n\nIt passed on Monday by a 70-26 vote with the help of a big bipartisan majority. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), and Bernie Sanders (I-V.t) opposed the measure. Many of those senators have approached Trump\u2019s foreign policy with caution, expressing criticism dealing with stylistic rather than substantive matters.\n\nWhile the amendment is a nonbinding provision without the force of law, it sent a clear message to the White House that any plans to immediately pull troops out of war zones could jeopardize the fight against groups like the so-called Islamic State, leave Kurdish allies on the ground defenseless, and embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran.\n\nSenate Republicans seldom buck Trump on anything, but they have become increasingly agitated lately over his administration\u2019s foreign policy. Last week, many top GOP senators voiced concern after Trump called the heads of his own intelligence agencies \u201cnaive\u201d for contradicting him about the threats North Korea and the Islamic State pose to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you can say this but I prefer the president would stay off Twitter \u2014 particularly with regard to these important national security issues,\u201d Sen.

When President Obama pulled out of Iraq, in theory, we had Iraq. In other words, we had Iraq. We never had Syria because President Obama never wanted to violate the red line in the sand.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) touted it during his Democratic presidential campaign. But Medicare for All couldn\u2019t be anything more than a rallying cry as long as Republicans controlled the levers of power in Washington.\n\nPolitical circumstances are different now. Democrats hold the House majority and, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office confirmed to The Washington Post on Thursday, at least two committees will hold hearings on Medicare for All this year. Exactly what those hearings will entail isn\u2019t clear \u2015 Democratic leaders aren\u2019t saying \u2015 but one focus will be a bill that Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) plans to introduce in the next few weeks.\n\nJayapal is a leader of a Medicare for All House caucus that had 78 members as of late November and, with an infusion of newly elected Democrats, should soon have more. The new bill will be similar to one she co-sponsored in the last Congress, which in turn was similar to a bill Sanders introduced in the Senate.\n\nJayapal has said she hopes a version will get a floor vote, although that seems a long ways off. The committees taking up the proposal initially aren\u2019t actually the ones that would write a health care bill. Even so, the hearings could represent the most serious attention the concept has received on Capitol Hill since the late 1940s, when committees took up then-President Harry Truman\u2019s similarly designed, but ill-fated national health insurance proposal.\n\nAnd Democrats in Congress won\u2019t be the only ones talking about Medicare for All over the next two years.\n\nWhen Sanders introduced his bill last year, the list of 16 Democratic co-sponsors included several prospective presidential contenders \u2015 among them, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who last week launched her exploratory committee for a White House bid. That announcement came one day after Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another likely presidential candidate, reaffirmed her support for Medicare for All in a New York Times Op-Ed. And, of course, Sanders himself is widely expected to run again.\n\nOne reason Medicare for All will get a hard look is that the Democratic Party\u2019s increasingly powerful progressives are determined to improve upon the coverage gains made under Affordable Care Act, which has helped many millions get health care but also left many millions still struggling to pay medical bills. A single government insurance plan, progressives say, would be more efficient and effective than Obamacare\u2019s awkward mix of private and public plans.\n\nAs proof Medicare for All can work, they cite the performance of national health systems in countries such as Canada, Sweden and Taiwan. As proof Medicare for All is popular, they cite surveys showing support among U.S. adults reaching 59 percent. But those poll numbers can be misleading. The same surveys show that when people hear about potential costs and trade-offs that come with Medicare for All, support falls.\n\nEven the architects of Medicare for All plans haven\u2019t fully worked out how their systems would function. That\u2019s particularly true when it comes to money questions, like how to pay doctors and hospitals or how to finance all the new public spending it would require.\n\nThey don\u2019t need all the specifics now. Medicare for All isn\u2019t going to become law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Donald Trump is the president. Meanwhile, the lawmakers and staff working on plans have already done more thinking than their conservative counterparts did about mythical, ultimately ill-fated Obamacare replacements.\n\nBut a Medicare for All system, like any complex policy enterprise, would entail difficult trade-offs. At some point advocates need to figure out how they want to handle those, how they\u2019ll overcome the inevitable political resistance to what they decide and which parts of their vision matter to them most.\n\nAmong the issues to consider:\n\nShould Private Insurance Have Any Role At All?\n\nThe existing Medicare for All proposals would basically eliminate private insurance because the new public program would cover everything, every single American would belong to it and the law would prohibit private insurers from offering anything similar.\n\nThe political benefit of this simplicity is that it\u2019s easy to explain. The main policy benefit is that it would simplify billing, which means that hospitals, clinics and other providers wouldn\u2019t have to hire so many administrative staff. That would make health care less expensive.\n\nBut wiping out private insurance would also mean ending the insurance arrangements that the majority of Americans now have, either through their employers or through Medicare Advantage, which is the private insurance option for seniors on Medicare.\n\nHow Americans would feel about this is a big unknown. As employer insurance gets more expensive, employers are passing along some of those higher costs to their workers in the form of higher co-pays and deductibles, to the point where some of the employees struggle to pay bills. And employer coverage often requires dealing with limited networks of doctors and hospitals.\n\nBut employer coverage is still popular, at least according to industry polling. As the 2017 fight to repeal Obamacare and pretty much every other health care battle has shown, change of any sort is scary. Americans are unlikely to welcome it unless they are absolutely convinced it\u2019s a change for the better.\n\nHow Generous Should Coverage Be?\n\nNo more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles \u2015 yes, that\u2019s right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing Medicare for All proposals. The only exception would be a provision in the Sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.\n\nThe logic here is that co-pays and deductibles inevitably fall hardest on the sick, because they have higher medical bills, and the poor, because they have less money at their disposal. Research shows that these groups will frequently respond to high out-of-pocket costs by rationing their own treatments and, as a result, suffer.\n\nBut zero cost-sharing could also encourage people to get care they don\u2019t need, which could mean unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tests and treatments, all while driving up costs throughout the system. Purely from a budgetary standpoint, the federal government would have to spend a lot more money if it\u2019s assuming responsibility for every single dollar on every single medical bill for every single American.\n\nZero cost-sharing is relatively unusual internationally. Most systems require at least some out-of-pocket spending, although it\u2019s usually a lot smaller and waived entirely for the poor and for treatment of cancer, diabetes and other chronic conditions.\n\nHow Aggressively Should Government Control Prices?\n\nThe reason Medicare for All can provide coverage to everybody, while spending less money, is that the government would regulate prices throughout the health care sector \u2015 not just on prescription drugs, but for doctors and hospitals and everything else.\n\nStudies have shown that health care prices in the U.S. are outrageously high by international standards. Knee replacements cost $28,000 on average in the U.S., for example, while they cost $18,000 in the U.K. In a Medicare for All system, the government would force American prices down \u2015 not all the way down to European levels, but enough to get a better handle on costs here.\n\nThe big question is how doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and all the other industries related to health care would react. Some would figure out how to become more efficient or live with lower margins. Some would react simply by reducing capacity, right at a moment when millions of newly insured people were seeking it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s assuming the price cuts would even become law. Even modest proposals to reduce what government programs pay providers and suppliers of medical care generate huge opposition from their lobbying groups. The kind that would come with Medicare for All would likely provoke an all-out war, one for which industry groups are already preparing.\n\nA lot would obviously depend on the details \u2015 that is, precisely how low a Medicare for All proposal would push prices and, critically, how long it would take for those reductions to take place. There\u2019s a vast difference between cutting hospital rates by 10 percent over three to four years and cutting them by the same margin over seven or eight.\n\nHow Should Government Finance The Program?\n\nMedicare for All envisions the federal government spending a lot more money on health care than it does today. The government has to find that money \u2015 by raising revenue through taxes or government-imposed premiums, cutting other spending, accepting higher deficits or some combination of the three.\n\nThe taxes and premiums would be in lieu of what private individuals and employers pay for insurance today, so that, advocates say, a majority would come out ahead. But exactly how many would depend on the budget arithmetic in the rest of the program. If the cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals aren\u2019t deep enough, for example, the whole program would end up more expensive, requiring bigger taxes and swelling the ranks of people who would feel worse off financially.\n\nHow Much Can Be Done, And How Quickly?\n\nMany Democrats do not support Medicare for All. But at this point even Democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion \u2015 if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, Medicare or Medicaid, to more people.\n\nOthers are enthusiastic about Medicare for All, but think it would be more practical, as policy and politics, to have a more gradual transition \u2015 for example, by making the new public insurance plan voluntary for individuals and employers, while enrolling newborns so that it gets bigger over time. That\u2019s the approach of a new bill from Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).\n\nSuch a scheme could also preserve a role for private insurers, providing the same kind of alternative, tightly regulated coverage they do for seniors on Medicare today. Hybrid systems with both public and private insurance are actually pretty common around the world \u2015 and succeed in establishing health care as a right, just as single government programs do.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-endorses-zephyr-teachout_us_5b96a04be4b0cf7b00425a3a": "Teachout has also proposed opening investigations into major corporations chartered in New York as a way to fight the Trump administration on policies ranging from climate change to predatory lending.\n\nSanders previously endorsed Teachout in her 2016 bid for New York\u2019s 19th Congressional District.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) labeled antitrust policy as one of the key planks in the party\u2019s new platform in a 2017 New York Times op-ed. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the new head of the House antitrust subcommittee, has promised to tackle head-on issues of consolidation in the pharmaceutical, hospital and tech industries.\n\nIn the recent past, Democrats have been more attentive to consolidation concerns in the telecommunications industry than in other sectors in which they allowed countless mergers during the presidency of Barack Obama. That could be due to the extreme consolidation already existing in this space. There are currently only four major mobile service providers \u2015 Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.\n\nThe Obama administration sued to block AT&T from purchasing T-Mobile in 2011 to prevent further consolidation that could raise prices and cost jobs.

The Communications Workers of America argues that the merger will cost 30,000 jobs. Other telecommunications law experts argue that the merger will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers, who already pay among the highest prices for mobile service in the world. Rural mobile service advocates argued that the merger will dramatically increase costs for people living in areas with poor mobile service coverage and do little to improve that coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic 2020 candidates are rightfully expressing concerns and opposition to the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger, but the negative effects and potential damage of the merger should not be a partisan issue,\u201d said Shane Larson, director of legislation, politics and international affairs at the Communications Workers of America.\n\nThe Democratic candidates may be opposed to the merger, but an anti-monopoly spirit has not taken over the party entirely.\n\nRep.

Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) and Sharice Davids (D-Kansas) \u2015 the first two Native women elected to Congress \u2015 and Andrews-Maltais, who was given an award.\n\n\u201cThe agenda is enormous and the fights will be tough,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIn tough fights, it is important to have leaders like Cheryl out in front. Cheryl is warm, and understanding and sharp. She\u2019s forceful and let\u2019s say it \u2014 she persists.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s remarks come after she apologized to the Cherokee Nation for releasing a DNA test in October in an attempt to prove she had Native ancestry. The Washington Post also recently revealed that Warren listed her race as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d when she filled out a form for the Texas state bar in 1986.\n\nCrystal Echohawk Rep.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at the National Indian Women\u2019s \u201cSupporting Each Other\u201d lunch.\n\nWarren has faced criticism from some Native people, but certainly not all, over her claims to Native ancestry. She never claimed citizenship in a tribe.\n\nShe was warmly welcomed at Tuesday\u2019s event. She could barely make it through the crowd of about 150 people as she was trying to leave, with attendees swarming her for photos and hugs by the door. Before she left, NCAI President Jefferson Keel and National Indian Gaming Association Chairman Ernie Stevens Jr. greeted her and took several photos with her. Prior to the event, the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center also presented Warren with a Native American shawl to thank her for her work on the Violence Against Women Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we show our support for her. We\u2019re not in the room yet,\u201d said Brenda Toineeta Pipestem, a former NIWRC board member and currently a tribal Supreme Court justice. \u201cWe have to rely on our allies to fight for us behind closed doors and on the floor of the Senate to protect our Native American women and children.\u201d\n\nJennifer Bendery Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is presented with a shawl of thanks from Native American women.\n\nPresident Donald Trump routinely makes racist attacks on Warren for saying she has Native ancestry, and says she tried to use her ancestry claims to advance her career. The Republican Party has piled on with racist attacks, too, as Warren embarks on a 2020 presidential bid. There is no evidence Warren\u2019s ancestry claims have ever helped her advance her career.\n\nHaaland introduced Warren at the event, saying, \u201cIndian Country needs strong allies like Elizabeth Warren, whose unwavering commitment to Native communities and Native American women and children is needed in this political era.\u201d\n\nWarren also spoke in a surprise appearance at the 2018 conference for the National Congress of American Indians and received a standing ovation. In that speech, she promised to stand up for Native American issues and insisted, \u201cI never used my family tree to get a break or get ahead. I never used it to advance my career.\u201d\n\nNational and state polls place Warren in the middle of a crowded field of presidential candidates. Most show the best-known potential candidates, like Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, leading the field.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lover-fighter-booker-warren-embody-2020-divide_us_5c620f86e4b071a3b765e3b7": "Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey agree on most of the issues. But they take sharply different approaches to winning over the Democratic primary electorate.\n\nLAWRENCE, Mass. \u2015 As Sen. Elizabeth Warren formally announced her presidential bid on Saturday, the core of her political identity was emblazoned on the lectern in front of her, instructing viewers to text the word \u201cFIGHT\u201d to receive updates on her campaign.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing the Massachusetts Democrat wants voters to know about her, it\u2019s that she\u2019s a fighter. The word \u201cfight\u201d is in the title of both of the books she\u2019s written while in the Senate (A Fighting Chance and This Fight Is Our Fight). In the 40-minute speech she delivered Saturday, she used the word 28 times.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of our lives,\u201d Warren said to the crowd of 3,500 who gathered at a historic mill in freezing temperatures here, after telling a story about immigrant women striking for better pay and working conditions. \u201cThe fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s team and allies believe they\u2019re adopting the combat-ready stance Democratic voters are craving, one focused on fighting and defeating the forces Warren sees as causing rampant economic inequality: Republicans, big banks, corporations and the lobbyists they employ.\n\nAt the same time, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) was delivering a very different pitch in Iowa, trying to convince the early caucus state\u2019s voters to adopt a message aimed at uniting a country fractured along class, racial and gender lines, using a story of a white lawyer who was inspired by the March on Selma to help Booker\u2019s parents outsmart a racist real estate agent. Over the course of two town halls lasting a little over two hours on Saturday, Booker used the word \u201clove\u201d two dozen times.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be one about trash-talking and trolling or demeaning and degrading a fellow American,\u201d he said at one point, addressing a packed town hall in Des Moines. \u201cPatriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.\n\n\u201cLove means that I see you. I see your worth. I see your dignity,\u201d said the senator, whose recent book was titled Unity. \u201cWe may not always agree. There are some days we may not like each other that much, but love says, I see you.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates, both senators from the Northeast who are seen as part of the party\u2019s liberal wing, embody the two poles of a rhetorical debate that will consume the Democratic Party over the course of the next year: Should the party select a candidate who is more focused on repairing the long-existing fractures in American society and culture exacerbated by the presidency of Donald Trump, or one focused on defeating the party\u2019s b\u00eates noires?\n\n\u201cThere are two schisms within the voter base,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa. \u201cThere\u2019s progressives versus the establishment. And there\u2019s \u2018When they go low, we go high\u2019 versus \u2018We want to fight.\u2019\u201d\n\nBagniewski\u2019s use of a phrase famously used by former first lady Michelle Obama at the 2016 Democratic National Convention points to another, frequently unspoken element of the debate. While no candidate would explicitly criticize President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular politician in the Democratic Party, the debate is also a de facto discussion of the former president\u2019s political leadership style.\n\nObama ran, famously, as the \u201cHope and Change\u201d candidate, and entered the White House with a strategy based on seeking bipartisan cooperation on a host of issues. Relentless opposition from GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ruined those plans, and Obama shifted in his second term to a strategy based on more unilateral moves.\n\nTo a certain extent, the rhetorical contrast mirrors an ideological divide. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are likely to be the two highest-profile progressive populists in the field, and both are fond of naming and shaming their opponents \u2015 Sanders essentially convinced Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $15 by relentlessly slamming Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s CEO. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a potential candidate and favorite of labor unions, also is well-practiced in inveighing against the American establishment.\n\nOn the opposite side are Booker, who has bucked his party with his support for charter schools; former Vice President Joe Biden, a moderate who has refused to apologize for his close relationships with Republicans; and center-left figures like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who are both fond of calling for unity.\n\nThere\u2019s progressives versus the establishment. And there\u2019s \u2018when they go low, we go high\u2019 versus \u2019we want to fight. Sean Bagniewski, Polk County Democrats chair\n\n\u201cWe may come from different places,\u201d Klobuchar said amid a snowstorm as she announced her candidacy Sunday in Minneapolis. \u201cWe may pray in different ways. We may look different and love different. But we all live in the same country of shared dreams.\u201d\n\nThe remaining top candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, tend to use a mix of both rhetorical styles.\n\nThe divide can be seen everywhere. At an event honoring Martin Luther King Jr. in South Carolina last month, Booker invoked the civil rights leader\u2019s record of bringing people together \u2015 \u201cKing said we can never let someone pull us so low as to hate them,\u201d Booker noted \u2015 while Sanders portrayed him an insurgent who wanted to bring drastic change to the American political system.\n\n\u201cWe must be faithful to his revolutionary spirit, his call for a \u2018radical revolution of values\u2019 and for his incredible courage in taking on virtually the entire political and economic establishment of his time,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nAnd while Warren\u2019s speech on Saturday blamed growing income inequality directly on the wealthiest Americans \u201cwaging class warfare against hardworking people for decades,\u201d Biden\u2019s desire for inclusion extends even to the nation\u2019s economic elite.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think 500 billionaires are the reason we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said at a Brookings Institution event in 2018. \u201cThe folks at the top aren\u2019t bad guys.\u201d\n\nThere are limits to the split: Warren regularly mentions her red-state upbringing in Oklahoma and isn\u2019t looking to replicate Trump\u2019s divide-and-conquer political tactics, and Booker isn\u2019t promising to roll over for Republicans and special interests. Nonetheless, it\u2019s clear Warren\u2019s supporters think the party has moved past its desire to place political unity over policy victories.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in your face,\u201d Jana Adam, a retired nurse who attended a Warren event in Sioux City, Iowa, said approvingly. \u201cJust trying to get people with hopefulness, it doesn\u2019t work anymore. You need to get down and dirty.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s backers, meanwhile, insist his re-creation of Obama\u2019s rhetoric in 2008 will lead to a repeat of Obama\u2019s successes in both the primary and general elections, pitching him as an antidote to Trump\u2019s constant divisiveness.\n\n\u201cAmericans have reached the point where they\u2019re just so tired of division. Cory Booker, his career, has been built on a really unifying message,\u201d said Jim Demers, a prominent New Hampshire Democrat who was one of Obama\u2019s earliest backers and now supports Booker. \u201cHis message, his style, his tone has always been all about bringing the country together.\u201d\n\nEarly polls of the 2020 field, which place Biden and Sanders as the front-runners, give few hints about which style Democrats might ultimately prefer. But in a CNN poll released earlier this month, 68 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said it was extremely or very important for a candidate to be willing to work with Republicans, while 65 percent said the same of holding progressive positions on the issues, and only 47 percent said it was important for a candidate to bring an outsider perspective to Washington.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-primary-house-democrats_us_5bf0e5f6e4b07573881f184a": "In a significant escalation of her activism-driven approach to politics, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has urged other progressives to mount primary challenges against some of the more conservative Democratic members of Congress.\n\nOcasio-Cortez delivered the appeal in a phone call on Saturday with some 700 progressive activists organized by Justice Democrats, the group of alumni of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential bid.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I need you to run for office,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez began her remarks. \u201cWe all need to run at all levels of government, but I really hope that many of you join me here in Congress.\u201d\n\nJustice Democrats recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run and played a key role in her upset of Rep. Joe Crowley, a House power-broker, in New York\u2019s Democratic primary in June. Ocasio-Cortez then easily won the seat Crowley has held since 1999 in this month\u2019s general election.\n\nThe group is calling its new campaign #OurTime. The initiative asks Justice Democrats\u2019 army of activists to help identify Democratic House incumbents who are \u201cdemographically and ideologically out-of-touch with their districts,\u201d and identify people who might make good primary challengers to them.\n\nJoining Ocasio-Cortez in backing the #OurTime initiative is Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n\nJustice Democrats\u2019 inclusion of demographic criteria likely means that even some reliably progressive white Democrats who represent more diverse districts won\u2019t be safe from such challenges in 2020. The group already showcased that approach with its support for Ayanna Pressley, a black Boston city council member who unseated progressive Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) in a primary in September.\n\nIf I made people mad, they could have put me on the dog-walking committee or whatever. They still might. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\n\nOcasio-Cortez and leaders of Justice Democrats say they are driven by a conviction that most current Democratic members of Congress are not up to the task of enacting the radical solutions to address the country\u2019s \u2015 and the planet\u2019s \u2015 most pressing problems. The most urgent of those crises, they said, include climate change, widening economic inequality and persistent racial injustice.\n\n\u201cThere are some good people who want to push for stuff, but they don\u2019t have the backup right now to do anything big,\u201d said Saikat Chakrabarti, a founder of Justice Democrats who is headed to Washington to serve as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cSo we need new leaders, period. We\u2019ve got to primary folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have folks who are mission-focused, and laser-focused on solving these gigantic problems, we just aren\u2019t going to get them solved in time,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is highly unusual for a member of Congress to support a massive number of primary challenges targeting party colleagues.\n\nBut over the course of last week\u2019s orientation on Capitol Hill for newly elected lawmakers, Ocasio-Cortez demonstrated she has little interest in adhering to traditional congressional norms of comity and deference.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez attended the Sunrise Movement\u2019s sit-in at the office of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and endorsed the group\u2019s call for a select committee to address climate change that is comprised solely of members of Congress who have not received fossil fuel industry money. The committee envisioned by Ocasio-Cortez and the group would be charged with drafting a Marshall Plan-style \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to have the U.S. powered entirely by renewable energy by 2035.\n\nThe committee idea has gained support from a handful of sitting House Democrats and newly elected ones. But the proposal and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support for it also elicited some public opposition from veteran Democratic colleagues, many of whom have senior committee posts and claim that a new panel is unnecessary.\n\nThe investigative news site Sludge subsequently reported that each of the Democrats quoted as criticizing Ocasio-Cortez had received massive donations during the 2018 campaign cycle from fossil-fuel industry and electric utility political action committees and employees.\n\nTo Ocasio-Cortez, the negative response to the idea of simply creating a committee tasked with drafting legislation only strengthens the case for more primary challenges to veteran incumbents.\n\nThe resistance to the proposal \u201cpoints to the role that fossil-fuel industry contributions play even within the Democratic Party,\u201d she said.\n\nIn another sign of her independence, Ocasio-Cortez has not yet joined the leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2015 which she is joining \u2015 in endorsing Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speaker. That gives Ocasio-Cortez some leverage in the bid to persuade Pelosi to establish the climate-change committee.\n\nThe 29-year-old democratic socialist said she is aware she may already face political punishment for her participation in the sit-in at Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIf I made people mad, they could have put me on the dog-walking committee or whatever. They still might. But I knew that it was worth it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her remarks to the Justice Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez invited activists considering running for office to take a similar leap in the faith that history would be on their side.\n\n\u201cKnow that they will come after you and that that\u2019s OK because at the end of the day, when you are on the right side of that long arc of history that bends toward justice, we will be able to tell our grandchildren that we fought for what\u2019s right,\u201d she said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comic-books-taught-the-holocaust_us_5bd9b961e4b019a7ab5911b0": "\u201cYou can never forget, can you, Carl Reissman?\u201d\n\nThose are the first words of \u201cMaster Race,\u201d a 1955 comic by Bernie Krigstein, Al Feldstein and Jack Davis. Spoken by an omniscient narrator, the vague question drags readers into its opening panels. \u201cEven here... in America... Ten years and thousands of miles away from your Native Germany,\u201d it continues. \u201cYou can never forget those Bloody War Years.\u201d\n\nThe title appears boldly atop the first page, cut in half by a miniature black swastika. Below is Carl Reissman himself, a white man in a khaki trench coat and fedora, descending into a subway station with his hands in his pockets. He buys a ticket and enters through a turnstile just in time to catch his train roaring into the station, an \u201conrushing steel monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you frightened, Carl?\u201d the hovering voice asks, the second question more off-putting than the first. \u201cThat was a long time ago! This is America. You\u2019re safe now! You\u2019re free.\u201d\n\nThat assurance \u2015 that the Holocaust is a horror of another time and place \u2015 is familiar to many American Jews. In 2018, however, it\u2019s an increasingly impotent claim. Particularly after the October massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which triggered a sickening sense of deja vu for so many. The Holocaust might be in the past, but its demons are far from locked there with it.\n\n\u201cThese times are not a small bit chilling,\u201d author and cartoonist Craig Yoe said.\n\nAlong with Neal Adams and Rafael Medoff, Yoe is co-editor of We Spoke Out: Comics and the Holocaust, a compilation of comics made in the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, visualizing atrocities of history through graphic panels and text bubbles. Contained within are comics that emerged years before public schools began widely teaching the events of the Holocaust, before they were immortalized in films like \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and graphic novels like Art Spiegelman\u2019s \u201cMaus.\u201d\n\n\u201cComic book creators were really unsung pioneers in Holocaust education,\u201d Medoff, a historian and the director of the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies in Washington, said. \u201cThey really did speak out at a time when most other people didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFrom \"We Spoke Out\" \"Holocaust 1,\" from April 1981\n\nBefore television, before the sprawl of the internet, comics were a medium for binging, the stuff parents worried would rot their teens\u2019 brains and corrupt innocence. The reasons were twofold: Comics were easy to produce, printed at a breakneck pace by publishers. And the readership was there to greet them.\n\n\u201cKids weren\u2019t using their money to buy books,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey were buying comics.\u201d\n\nAs a result, writers and artists from the 1950 to 1980s were given \u201ctremendous freedom\u201d to concoct stories as they wished, Yoe said. Overworked, underpaid and eager to churn out the next hit, creators addressed grisly topics other fields didn\u2019t dare touch, unafraid to tell the spine-chilling tales that gripped readers.\n\n\u201cComic book people are not in the business of crusading,\u201d Neal Adams told HuffPost over the phone. \u201cThey\u2019re in the business of telling stories and getting paid at the end of the week. Running across subject matter like this, it\u2019s really very little more than business as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubject matter like this\u201d included Hitler, the Third Reich and the 6 million Jews murdered in concentration camps. These historical atrocities became plot points in Marvel and DC comics, from Batman to X-Men to Captain Marvel. In the 1980 Captain America issue \u201cNight of the Nazi,\u201d the Captain\u2019s landlady, Anna, recalls painful memories from her time in Diebenwald, where she played in the concentration camp orchestra. Some real-life camps had such compulsory ensembles, whose music would accompany prisoners\u2019 whippings and executions.\n\nOne day, in 1980 Brooklyn, Anna runs into Dr. Klaus Mendelhaus, also known as \u201cthe Butcher of Diebenwald,\u201d who forced her into sexual slavery. She faints from the shock. Mendelhaus kidnaps her and brings her to an abandoned church, where she learns of his intention to start a new Nazi regime. Just then, Captain America soars in with a \u201cKraash!\u201d and battles the hoard of Nazis one by one.\n\n\u201cI can hate too,\u201d Captain America says as he smashes a cluster of Nazis with a wooden frame. \u201cI hate everything you stand for!\u201d In the end, Anna and Captain America have the butcher surrounded. Anna points the gun toward her former captor as Captain America begs her not to shoot.\n\n\u201cMurder is the only solution left...\u201d she says. \u201cThis butcher taught me that.\u201d With a \u201cblam blam\u201d she shoots him dead.\n\nAccording to Adams, these comics weren\u2019t necessarily created with a moral imperative in mind. Yet Yoe suspects \u201cmany working-stiff artists and writers have an ingrained social conscious,\u201d and \u201cthese comics reflect their defiant little subterfuge against evil.\u201d\n\nAfter all, Jewish people factored prominently in the nascent comic book industry. \u201cHarry Donenfeld published Jerry Seigel and Joe Shuster\u2019s story of a welcomed immigrant, Superman,\u201d Yoe said. \u201cBob Kane co-created Batman. Stan Lee, with Jack Kirby created the X-Men.\u201d Of the 18 stories in We Spoke Out, 11 were written by Jews.\n\nvia \"We Spoke Out\" Batman #237 \"Night of The Reaper,\" from Decembe 1971\n\nMost of the comics featured in We Spoke Out adhere to the norms of the genre, juxtaposing superheroes in capes with SS soldiers wearing swastika armbands. Imaginary visions of Robin battling the Grim Reaper live just pages away from horrible images of mass graves and medical torture. Comic books\u2019 typically sensational flourishes take a backseat to the very real events described because, as Adams put it, \u201cthere is little about the Holocaust you can sensationalize.\u201d\n\nNot every comic written about the Holocaust appropriately balanced education and entertainment, a reality the co-editors kept in mind when selecting the works for their book. \u201cIn one 1950s horror comic, the Jewish victims came back from the dead as vampires to bite Nazis,\u201d Medoff said. \u201cYou can see why we didn\u2019t include that one in We Spoke Out.\u201d\n\nThe comics that made it in, however, combined history, fantasy and emotion to boil an unfathomable historical nightmare down to stories that American youth would devour. As Medoff added, \u201cthese comic book stories can be just as effective today as they were when they were first published, because the problems they\u2019re addressing never completely go away.\u201d\n\nYoe described \u201cMaster Race\u201d as the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d of comic books. It certainly catches the reader off guard when it\u2019s revealed that the protagonist Carl \u2015 who finally, in America, is safe and free \u2015 was not a Jewish prisoner but a Nazi commander at the Belsen concentration camp.\n\n\u201cDo you remember, Carl?\u201d the narrator continues. \u201cDo you remember the awful smell of the gas chambers that hourly annihilated hundreds and hundreds of your countrymen? Do you remember the stinking odor of human flesh burning in the ovens... Men\u2019s... Women\u2019s... Children\u2019s... People you once knew and talked to and drank beer with?...\u201d\n\nBeneath the text, men and women shuffle about town, separated from the camp by a yellow wall. They tuck their faces into their coats and breathe into handkerchiefs to mask the stench.\n\nThe narrator proceeds to haunt Reissman with reminders of the evils he committed. He grows more panicked upon recognizing another passenger on the train, a gaunt man in all-black. As the train grinds to a halt, the man in black catches Reissman\u2019s gaze and screams, \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d\n\nReissman rushes off the train and sprints through the station, with the man in black trailing close behind. \u201cRun... As you ran from Belsen, Carl!\u201d the narrator howls. A train approaches. Reissman, running wildly through the platform, loses his balance and falls onto the tracks. A panel focuses on the man in black\u2019s face as the train zooms by, crushing Reissman beneath it. A crowd gathers, but the man denies knowing Reissman at all. \u201cHe was a perfect stranger...\u201d he says, turning his back to the reader.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-bland-scott-walker-troy-evers-governor_us_5bd74093e4b0a8f17efab16c": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On back-to-back days last week, some of the most exciting Democratic politicians in the country came to get out the vote in this crucial swing state.\n\nTony Evers, the Democratic nominee for governor, was also there.\n\nCalifornia Sen.

Baldwin on the ballot, and long-standing antipathy to Walker \u2014 remains high.\n\nWhile Democrats in Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona have picked young politicians of color \u2014 Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and David Garcia, respectively \u2014 as their gubernatorial nominees in hopes of firing up Democratic voters who often don\u2019t show in midterm election years, Democrats across the Rust Belt have instead selected experienced technocrats, and are pitching themselves to swing voters as the solution to America\u2019s political chaos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just who I am,\u201d Evers said of his low-key, low-drama, low-excitement style in a phone interview a few hours after his rally with Sanders. \u201cI think people are sick of polarization, and sick of not getting things done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tack Democrats are pursuing throughout the Midwest, nominating a self-proclaimed nerd in Ohio\u2019s Richard Cordray, a deal-cutting legislative insider in Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, and a buttoned-down businessman in Iowa\u2019s Fred Hubbell. All are promising to end one type of chaos or another: Hubbell is promising to undo a flawed privatization of Medicaid; and Whitmer\u2019s modest major policy promises are to \u201cfix the damn roads\u201d and end the water crisis in Flint. Evers is focused on protecting pre-existing conditions and fixing the state\u2019s potholes, which he calls \u201cScottholes.\u201d\n\nAnd it could be replicated in 2020. With President Donald Trump\u2019s White House in constant flux, his rhetoric\u2019s divisiveness increasing without apparent end and more Americans describing themselves as \u201cexhausted\u201d by politics, Democratic strategists have begun musing that the best way to defeat Trump may be to go boring.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the matchup between Evers and Walker \u2014 whose eight-year tenure has included mass protests of his union-busting bill at the state capitol, followed by a recall attempt and a presidential run \u2014 that provides the clearest test of the strategy.\n\n\u201cDemocratic candidates in the Midwest are pushing back on Donald Trump\u2019s chaos with competence,\u201d Democratic Governors\u2019 Association spokesman Jared Leopold said. \u201cVoters want steady leaders who\u2019ll get things done and fight back against wrong-headed policies from D.C.\u201d\n\nEvers doesn\u2019t push back too hard against the \u201cboring\u201d label. In a video his campaign posted where he reads mean tweets, he responds to a missive calling him boring by noting he knows how to both dance the polka and play euchre.\n\nIn the primary, voters chose Evers over two younger, more progressive options: 41-year-old firefighters\u2019 union leader Mahlon Mitchell once described Evers as \u201clike my grandfather,\u201d and 39-year-old state legislator Kelda Roys rose concerns Evers wouldn\u2019t be able to turn out young people. Unlike Mitchell and Roys, Evers didn\u2019t support the legalization of marijuana, instead asking for a statewide referendum.\n\nAnd on another key progressive priority, health care, Evers is treading carefully. While he hammers Walker over his administration\u2019s support for repealing Obamacare\u2019s protections for pre-existing conditions, he says he supports slowly moving toward single-payer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be incremental steps for this,\u201d he said, noting he would first push for Wisconsin to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, then push for a public option in the state\u2019s Badgercare program. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a stepping stone. We can\u2019t get too far ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Walker \u2014 a preacher\u2019s son who is known to wear camouflage hunting gear and ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2014 isn\u2019t a thrill-ride of a candidate either. (The Capital Times, the major newspaper in Madison, recently dubbed the governor\u2019s race a battle of \u201cbland vs. bland.\u201d In the story, Evers said in the early \u201980s, he and his wife \u201cbelonged to the Lions Club together and did all that kind of crazy stuff.\u201d)\n\nThe Walker campaign, meanwhile, is trying to turn Evers into a figure exciting enough for Republicans to oppose. The incumbent governor has a significant spending advantage, according to operatives on both sides, and has aired 34 different ads this cycle, attacking Evers as a tax-and-spend liberal. They\u2019ve lately slammed him for plagiarizing parts of his budget documents \u2014 Evers has apologized, and said the works were improperly cited.\n\n\u201cNational Democrats are spending tens of millions of dollars targeting Wisconsin and are lining up their top surrogates to try and provide a jolt to Tony Evers\u2019 campaign and defeat Scott Walker,\u201d said Brian Reisinger, a spokesman for Walker. \u201cThe problem for Evers is all the national Democrats flooding our state only further highlight his liabilities with voters \u2014 from the tax-and-spend record of Jay Inslee to the rampant plagiarism of Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nBack at the field office in Milwaukee, a crowd of around 100 had crammed into a small room to see Harris, lining up to take selfies with her, and happily singing \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention Evers much \u2014 the two had just met \u2014 but she said Baldwin had been talking up the gubernatorial candidate.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-kansas_us_5b528032e4b0de86f48d218f": "Luke Harbur /The Kansas City Star via AP New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks in support of Kansas Democrat Brent Welder in Kansas City, Kansas, on Friday night.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 Sen.

It\u2019s the only district in a Great Plains state Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won and is chock-full of the college-educated suburbanites who have turned against Republicans in recent years.\n\n\u201cAnd they said it wouldn\u2019t work in the Midwest,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez declared at the start of her 10-minute speech, to the cheers of 1,500 people packed into a sweaty auditorium. The line was a reference to comments from Sen.

Few national Democrats give James Thompson, the candidate Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders stumped for in Wichita, a real chance of winning against GOP Rep. Ron Estes in November. (Estes narrowly beat Thompson last year in a low-turnout special election.) And Welder will have to beat two strong candidates in the Aug. 7 primary: history teacher Tom Niermann has the backing of a slew of local politicians, and EMILY\u2019s List has already pledged to spend heavily to back former Obama administration official Sharice Davids.\n\nJaime Green/The Wichita Eagle via AP Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson with Sen.

Board of Education ruling. Welder noted the original populist movement grew out of Kansas more than a century ago.\n\nThe crowd began lining up more than two hours before the event. At its peak, the line stretched around the block, with seemingly every branch of the Democratic Party in attendance: women wearing Moms Demand Action T-shirts, a man holding a sign showing Sanders cuddling a kitten, Black Lives Matter activists and Our Revolution members.\n\nWhile Sanders was the headliner, Welder ended his speech on a note designed to evoke a more successful Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama.

If it were to become law, the proposal would more than double the current federal rate of $7.25 per hour and supersede most state minimum wages.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders introduced the same measure in the Senate, with 31 Democratic co-sponsors. On Twitter, the Vermont independent called $7.25 a \u201cstarvation wage.\u201d\n\nThe measure is a long way from becoming law. Republicans still hold a majority in the Senate and have declined to work with Democrats on any increase, let alone one this significant. It would also need approval from the White House, where President Donald Trump has been pulling the reins off businesses, not putting new ones on.\n\nEven so, the bill\u2019s introduction highlights new opportunities for Democrats. The party has been unable to move a minimum wage bill out of committee for several years as Republicans held full control of Congress. House GOP leaders haven\u2019t held a hearing or markup on the minimum wage since taking the chamber in 2010. Democrats have decided to make the measure one of their first orders of business after picking up 40 House seats in the November midterm elections.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (center), hope to pass a minimum wage bill now that they have a majority. However, the legislation's prospects look bleak in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nIt is not clear yet whether Democrats would have all the votes they need among their own party. Some moderate members in states with low costs of living may be leery of doubling the federal minimum wage in just a few years. But Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the new chair of the House Committee on Education and Labor, told HuffPost previously that he\u2019s confident the party will rally around the plan.\n\n\u201cIf you do it gradually, all the economic research I\u2019ve seen shows that it can work,\u201d Scott said last month. \u201cIf you try to do it all at once, you do have job loss, and [the] economists we\u2019ve talked to get a little nervous if you try to do it too quickly. But a gradual increase over the years, to get us to $15, improves people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe House measure had 181 co-sponsors as of Wednesday. It would need 218 votes to pass.\n\nRep.

It hasn\u2019t budged since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed by President George W. Bush went into effect.\n\nThe push behind the bill shows just how much the debate surrounding the minimum wage has shifted within the Democratic Party.

Gene Green (D), who has held the seat ever since but did not run for re-election this year.\n\n\u201cI wanted Latino girls and boys to know this is a state of opportunity and it\u2019s a welcoming state,\u201d Garcia said in March. \u201cYou have to work hard and believe in yourself and you can do it.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates support abortion rights, were endorsed by the powerhouse Democratic women\u2019s PAC EMILY\u2019s List, and have cited Trump\u2019s policies as motivation for running. But they differ on immigration rights. Garcia favors abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while Escobar wants to hold the agency more accountable for its actions.\n\nFor both women, the potential to make history was not their motivation for running, but they recognize the importance of the milestone.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-minimum-wage-hike-compensation-cuts_us_5bb573d2e4b028e1fe3a6ba9": "Managers at an Amazon fulfillment center probably thought they would be leading a celebration when they explained the company\u2019s new pay scheme to employees on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, some workers turned angry, convinced their take-home pay would go down.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer announced Tuesday that starting in November, all its workers would receive at least $15 per hour \u2015 a key demand of labor advocates and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who had been trashing the company for its pay practices all year.\n\nBut Amazon is making other changes to employees\u2019 compensation to help pay for the new wage floor in its fulfillment centers. Those changes include getting rid of what\u2019s known as the \u201cvariable compensation program,\u201d or VCP, which is based on a worker\u2019s attendance and his facility\u2019s production level, and eliminating a stock allotment program for certain employees.\n\n\u201cYou guys are taking VCP away!\u201d shouted one worker during a Q&A session following a presentation about the raises. HuffPost obtained a secretly recorded video of the presentation from a source who said the video is from a facility in Arizona.\n\nSpeaking into a microphone, a manager tried to assure the roomful of workers that everyone would be better off.\n\n\u201cPlease, please understand, you will all see a benefit from this ... Please be patient,\u201d the manager urged as workers talked over him.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said in an email that despite the cuts to the bonus and stock programs, all hourly workers would still come out ahead.\n\n\u201cThe significant increase in hourly cash wages more than compensates for the phase out of incentive pay and [restricted stock units],\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cWe can confirm that all hourly Operations and Customer Service employees will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement.\u201d\n\nWorkers already earning more than $15 per hour will be receiving dollar raises so everyone sees some kind of hourly pay hike. But several of those workers told HuffPost they have a hard time seeing how their pay will go up, considering the other changes.\n\nI don\u2019t come out ahead. It seems like the same pile of money, they\u2019re just moving it around. Amazon employee\n\nOne Amazon fulfillment center worker said he pulled down around $2,000 in pay through the variable compensation program over the course of a year. Losing that money, he said, would basically negate the dollar-per-hour raise he\u2019s expecting through the new program. (A 40-hour workweek translates to 2080 hours per year.)\n\nTaking the loss of restricted stock units into account, he suspects he will have less annual take-home pay than before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come out ahead,\u201d said the employee, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely. \u201cIt seems like the same pile of money, they\u2019re just moving it around.\u201d\n\nAn employee in Florida said that as a new hire, he was glad to get a raise, but that some of his longer-tenured colleagues feared they would lose out.\n\n\u201cAssociates are torn,\u201d he said.\n\nThe worker said the company awarded one share of restricted stock to employees after they\u2019d worked at the company for a year, with the stock vesting a year later, meaning employees could then sell the stock for cash. One share of Amazon stock as of Wednesday afternoon is worth nearly $2,000.\n\nThe worker said the VCP program had amounted to 8 percent of his pay each month.\n\nThe tradeoff should be a good thing on the whole for many employees. As in many workplaces, a lot of Amazon workers don\u2019t stick around long enough for their stock to vest, making it a benefit only on paper. In a high-turnover environment, workers might prefer cash wages to stock, depending on the latter\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cThe net effect of this change and the new higher cash compensation is significantly more total compensation for employees, without any vesting requirements, and with more predictability,\u201d the company said in a press release Tuesday.\n\nAmazon\u2019s announcement of its new wage floor followed weeks of harsh criticism from Sanders, who said it was a disgrace that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2015 the world\u2019s richest man, according to Forbes \u2015 paid his workers so little that some qualified for government programs like Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nSanders pilloried Bezos in interviews and even in legislation, introducing a bill called The Stop BEZOS Act.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-trump-saudi-arabia-yemen_us_5bff0327e4b0388c1770ec4b": "WASHINGTON \u2015 A striking majority of senators voted Wednesday afternoon to move forward a bill ending U.S. support for a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, offering the biggest condemnation to date of a three-year policy linked to tens of thousands of deaths, hundreds of alleged war crimes and bitter stateside debate under two presidents.\n\nFourteen Republicans voted with every single Democrat in the chamber to consider a resolution authored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) that demands the policy be ended within 30 days. Thirty-seven senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), voted the other way, to preserve without debate the status quo of American intelligence, logistical and diplomatic assistance for the Saudi campaign.\n\nThe 63-37 vote represented a huge win for lawmakers and outside groups who had been trying to build support for the anti-war effort since the last time a measure was brought up in March. That resolution failed by a vote of 55-44.\n\nMoreover, intense efforts by the Trump administration to defend the policy \u2015 including a closed-door briefing with senators earlier in the day by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2015 backfired, as powerful GOP senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally, expressed frustration with top officials.\n\n\u201cI changed my mind because I\u2019m pissed,\u201d Graham, who had previously opposed the measure, told reporters after the vote. \u201cThe way the administration has handled Saudi has been unacceptable. The briefing didn\u2019t help me today at all.\u201d\n\nOther senators similarly complained about the failure of CIA director Gina Haspel to appear at the briefing to discuss U.S. intelligence about Saudi authorities\u2019 roles in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe Senate will now debate the measure on the floor within the next few weeks, and it is likely to face numerous amendments that could water it down. Even if it is ultimately passed, it will not compel an end to the U.S. support for the effort by the Saudis and their partner the United Arab Emirates.\n\nStill, Wednesday\u2019s vote was a landmark moment for the increasingly tense debates over who controls matters of war and peace for the U.S. and what to do about the decades-old U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nThe way the administration has handled Saudi has been unacceptable. The briefing didn\u2019t help me today at all. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at this for 3 years, and I am blown away by this,\u201d Murphy wrote on Twitter.\n\nLee said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the margin of victory on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think that shows people are watching this issue, that they\u2019re concerned,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI think it\u2019s significant that we\u2019re fighting someone else\u2019s war a half a world away, a war that\u2019s never been authorized by the Congress. It\u2019s not just the mere formality of going through the motions of declaring a war, it\u2019s about when you don\u2019t go through that process, the American people never get brought in to the discussion about whether or not to sacrifice in American blood.\u201d\n\nThe Utah conservative said he saw the vote as more a victory for the separation of powers, particularly the role of Congress in declaring war, than a hit against President Donald Trump, noting that it was President Barack Obama who initially approved the Yemen policy. His comment reflected how multiple factors drove this coalition of senators together: Some saw this primarily as a constitutional issue, others chiefly a humanitarian one, and for most, it appeared that the combination, added to frustration over the Khashoggi killing, made the vote inevitable.\n\nOutside groups who have been major players in the Capitol Hill fight over what\u2019s become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster applauded the senators\u2019 stand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Kate Kizer of the peace group Win Without War wrote on Twitter. She and other advocates for the bill are hopeful for its future prospects.\n\nCorker hinted that some Republicans could end up not supporting it in future votes, said Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation. But new Democratic unity on the issue \u2015 10 voted against the last iteration of the bill \u2015 and the near-guaranteed support of Lee and ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) suggests the legislation enters upcoming procedural battles with at least a simple majority of 51.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-tom-perez-neutrality-rules-2020-presidential-primaries_us_5c0ea4dce4b0edf5a3a75ff3": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Washington on election night this year. On Dec. 10 the DNC rolled out strict rules barring favoritism in the 2020 presidential primaries.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee issued rules Monday aimed at shoring up trust in its impartiality in the upcoming 2020 presidential nominating contest.\n\nThe DNC plans to bar employees and officers from publicly endorsing any presidential candidates throughout what is expected to be a crowded intraparty competition for the job of taking on President Donald Trump.\n\nThe rules would prohibit DNC staffers and officers from financial contributions to particular candidates, attendance of events that could suggest partiality, public statements or social media posts espousing presidential preferences, internal communications expressing views for or against Democratic candidates, and even gestures like displaying bumper stickers or lawn signs for individual campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe new DNC is committed to making sure that our 2020 nominating process is fair and transparent,\u201d said its Chairman Tom Perez. \u201cThese new policies will help ensure that there is no perception of partiality by the DNC during the campaign for the Democratic nomination.\u201d\n\nDNC CEO Seema Nanda sent a memorandum to DNC staff laying out the new guidelines on Monday afternoon.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) surprised many during his 2016 presidential run by winning the votes of millions as an explicitly \u201csocialist\u201d candidate. In 2018 we\u2019re seeing a rash of candidates running on socialist tickets. Most high-profile of these is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was propelled into the public eye \u2015 along with her progressive policies like job guarantees and universal, single-payer health care \u2015 following her unexpected victory against veteran incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in a New York Democratic primary.\n\nIn contrast, capitalism, once defended as a seemingly unassailable ideology, is showing deep fractures. While the U.S. economy booms, \u201cworkers have been getting ripped off,\u201d a New York Times editorial said in August.\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is projected to become the youngest woman elected to Congress this November when she will be 29 years old.\n\nBroadly felt problems with capitalism \u2015 rising inequality, stagnating wages and severe instability \u2015 have led to major global political and cultural shifts. Certainly, this is manifesting itself in the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave Europe, the election of Donald Trump, Italy\u2019s new anti-establishment government and the rise of right-wing populism throughout Europe.\n\nBut we can also see this in an increased appetite to seek alternatives to capitalism. A Gallup poll this month looking at U.S. attitudes toward socialism and capitalism said for the first time since the organization started tracking the issue in 2010 that Democrats have a more positive image of socialism than capitalism. Their positive feelings toward capitalism have plummeted.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem with this resurgence of interest in socialism, however. People cannot agree on what the term actually means.\n\nSocialism is an economic theory that\u2019s been around since the early 19th century. It gained an increased prominence later that century with the publication of Das Kapital, the critique of capitalism by socialism\u2019s most famous theorist, Karl Marx.\n\nAlex Potemkin via Getty Images A statue of Karl Marx in Kaliningrad, Russia.\n\nAs ideas about socialism took hold and spread, the economic theory has morphed, bending and adapting to different cultures, economies and political systems. People\u2019s interpretations of the true meaning of socialism also started to diverge, as did their theories on how best to make the transition from capitalism to socialism.\n\nTwo major \u2015 and clashing \u2015 interpretations have prevailed over others. Both interpretations use the same word, \u201csocialism,\u201d but they give it very different meanings.\n\nRethink the whole system\n\nIn one camp are those who believe socialism would involve a fundamental change in the structure of our economy, to completely undo our current system\u2019s division of people into categories of employee and employer.\n\nThose who support this interpretation point to Marx\u2019s explanation of capitalism. He wrote that under capitalism, workers \u2015 who make up the vast majority \u2015 produce surpluses. This refers to the value left over after producing goods or services once the costs of production and the amounts needed to sustain the producers are taken into account. In other words, the profit.\n\nUnder capitalism, this surplus is immediately taken by the employer, who uses it to reinforce a system where they dominate economically, politically and culturally.\n\nFor those who believe socialism means structural change, this relationship would be replaced by a democratic community of people who would produce goods or services. This same community would then collectively own the surplus it produced and democratically decide how to use it. In other words, this scenario involves dismantling the employer/employee relationship.\n\nCapture the state\n\nOthers think very differently. As socialism spread quickly during the latter half of the 19th century, across Europe and beyond, many of its advocates were impatient to make the transition from capitalism to socialism. They wanted a strategy, and some socialists, Marx included, provided one: Take control of the state.\n\nOnce state power was captured by a coalition of capitalism\u2019s critics and victims, the theory went, it would lead to socialism. The problem with this focus on the state was that it led to considerable confusion over how states and economic systems relate.\n\nWithin this state-focused socialism there were two schools of thought. Some believed that once the state was captured, all private business \u2015 previously owned and controlled by private individuals \u2015 should be put into state hands. State officials would hire workers, supervise their work and sell their products and services. The nationalization of industry in Soviet Russia is an example of this thinking.\n\nHowever, others came to believe that given historical conditions, the most a captured state could do would be to regulate and control private capitalism, which would largely remain in private hands. The goal would be at the very least to protect, and at best to advance, the interests of workers in their endless negotiations and struggles with capitalist employers.\n\nRealism, these thinkers often insisted, placed limits on what could be done. These socialists called their position \u201csocial democracy,\u201d or \u201cdemocratic socialism,\u201d to indicate a progressive, state-regulated private capitalism.\n\nThe most visible example of this is in the social democracies of the Scandinavian countries, which practice a gentler, kinder form of capitalism. Also known as the Nordic model, it\u2019s based on national health insurance, subsidized education and transportation, and other policies aimed at social equality.\n\nWe need to think bigger\n\nThis interpretation of socialism \u2015 the social democracy of the Nordics \u2015 has come to dominate the public debate about socialism. But this misses the bigger picture. It is a limited interpretation of socialism, better characterized as state capitalism, that fails to redraw the oppressive employer/employee relationship.\n\nAll the modifications made to capitalism by social democracies were difficult to achieve and remain inherently insecure. First in the U.K. and later to varying degrees across much of Western Europe, strongly social democracies established during the 1930s and 1940s have been weakened and rolled back. Such changes to capitalism fall far short of the more fundamental change required for genuine socialism.\n\nAs people argue between conventional capitalism and the gentler capitalism of social democracy, so countries have swung from one to the other. The modern world has repeatedly observed its private capitalist phases accumulate dissatisfied citizens, conflicts and tensions that eventually explode.\n\nWhen the internal strains and structural problems of private capitalism are felt, for example after the Great Depression of the 1930s, so an era of more state-based capitalism is ushered in, exemplified in the New Deal. And vice versa. Transitions between two forms of the same economic ideology have proved easier to imagine and pursue than a transition to a totally different system.\n\nBut these repetitions show that neither transition has solved capitalism\u2019s underlying problems.\n\nCritics of capitalism need to ask themselves a basic question. Is it not time to say Stop, enough, not another oscillation between different ideas of capitalism? We need to bring back from the margins of socialism the perspective that prioritizes transition beyond the employer/employee structure of production.\n\nMy vote goes for the democratization of businesses \u2015 for a transition from top-down, hierarchical organization to democratic, worker co-op organization.\n\nThis is already being achieved in the Emilia Romagna region of northeast Italy, for example, where worker cooperatives make up over 40 percent of the economy. The northern Spanish town of Mondragon is home to the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation, the world\u2019s biggest worker cooperative, which has succeeded and grown for half a century. And in California\u2019s Bay Area, the Arizmendi bakeries offer another long-term worker co-op success story.\n\nTransitioning to democratic worker co-op forms like these will be central to our era\u2019s way of going beyond capitalism to something better.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-fairfax-impeachment-hearing_us_5c5ffd28e4b0f9e1b17e10f5": "Fairfax has vehemently denied the allegations, stating, \u201cI have never forced myself on anyone ever,\u201d according to a statement given to The Washington Post.\n\nNumerous Democrats have demanded the lieutenant governor\u2019s resignation, including Sens.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to \u201cfight back\u201d against the \u201cclass warfare\u201d waged by the super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort.\n\n\n\nRather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy \u2015 an \u201cus\u201d against a proverbial \u201cthem\u201d \u2015 Booker focuses almost entirely on the \u201cus\u201d \u2015 on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement.\n\n\n\nBooker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States\u2019 forefathers \u201cimperfect geniuses\u201d for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not.\n\nI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it. Tom Swartz, former Iowa state representative, referring to Booker\n\nIn this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman\u2019s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism.\n\n\u201cIf we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,\u201d he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Booker\u2019s appeals to America\u2019s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders\u2019 work of forming a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama\u2019s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job.\n\nOn Booker\u2019s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it,\u201d said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown.\n\nAfter the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren\u2019s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.)\n\nBut Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump\u2019s invective.\n\n\u201cIt probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,\u201d Blaisdell said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Charlie Neibergall Booker minged with voters at the First Congregational United Church of Christ on Friday in Mason City, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I Had To Run Something\u2019\n\nBooker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders \u2015 which includes several of his Senate colleagues. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have announced their candidacies; Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs.\n\nBooker, whose mother\u2019s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party\u2019s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cMy story is your story,\u201d he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class.\n\nBooker tells story of his Iowa roots. His ancestors moved from Alabama to mining town of Buxton; grandmother grew up in Des Moines. pic.twitter.com/lnrwamvd3V \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nMany of the Iowans who came to hear Booker speak knew him already from his dramatic, televised confrontations with Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s confirmation hearings last year.\n\nHe burnished his credentials among many Democrats when he released a memo Kavanaugh had written on racial profiling after the Republican-controlled committee refused to publicize it and barred Booker from questioning the nominee about it. On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a \u201cSpartacus moment,\u201d a reference that left observers quizzical.\n\nRegardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI had to run something,\u201d Booker said in Marshalltown. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nThe experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate.\n\nBooker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing.\n\nGrassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country\u2019s system of law enforcement and incarceration.\n\nRather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\u201cSome people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. \u201cWell, I ran a fire department. That\u2019s not going to be a constructive strategy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Susan Walsh Booker cajoles Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to join him in an Instagram Live post in December. Looking on is Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nShrugging Off Criticism From The Left\n\nOf course, Booker\u2019s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term \u201cWall Street\u201d \u2015 a favorite target of attack among his party\u2019s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.)\n\nIn his efforts to improve Newark\u2019s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good.\n\nBooker\u2019s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies.\n\nIn addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago.\n\nBooker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations.\n\nIn Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools.\n\nTime and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities.\n\nRather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor.\n\n\u201cI was like Malcolm X \u2014 by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,\u201d he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening.\n\nAt the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren.\n\nHe admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high. But rather than lower it to 21 percent from 35 percent, as the GOP measure did, he would have left it at 25 or 26 percent.\n\nAnd in a conversation that night about climate policy in Iowa City, he described nuclear energy as part of the solution.\n\nMore on climate change: He supports nuclear energy and thinks any climate bill must be bipartisan (unless there\u2019s a 60-vote Senate due to \u201cblue tsunami\u201d). This is at supporter\u2019s home in Iowa City. pic.twitter.com/GkkUZVa4E2 \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nBooker was keen to emphasize that action on what he sees as the country\u2019s most urgent priorities \u2015 such as universal health coverage and addressing climate change \u2015 would require either compromise with Republicans or a \u201cblue tsunami\u201d big enough to grant Democrats a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.\n\nBooker is a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation, which would replace private health insurance with a federal single-payer program. But on two occasions in Iowa, he suggested that the bill is an aspiration unlikely to be realized in the near future, given the constraints of GOP numbers in the Senate.\n\nSingle-payer health care \u201cis a goal we should shoot at,\u201d he told a crowd of 500 people at Kum & Go Theater in Des Moines on Saturday.\n\nIn the interim, he proposed backing a Medicare buy-in or lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age to 55 or 50.\n\nWhat Booker did not volunteer in his discussion is that he not only opposes efforts to abolish the filibuster in the Senate, he has promised to personally defend the practice if it came under assault.\n\nStill, many of the Democrats who attended Booker\u2019s events seemed either unaware of Booker\u2019s deviations from progressive orthodoxy or relatively unbothered by it after hearing him speak.\n\nShawn Harmsen, a 46-year-old journalism professor, hosted a campaign gathering for Booker at his home in Iowa City, where he prominently displayed a blue \u201cI [heart] public educators\u201d sign on his front lawn. Harmsen wants to know more about Booker\u2019s support for charter schools, but held out the possibility that such educational alternatives might be acceptable in circumstances \u201cwhere you have minority communities who are tired of waiting for the public school system.\u201d\n\nRoberta Rosheim, a 69-year-old retired school teacher and union activist, and her husband, David, 74, a seller of rare books, went into Booker\u2019s Des Moines town hall skeptical. Roberta had read about his support for charter schools and his past receipt of pharmaceutical industry money.\n\nBut Roberta said they emerged \u201cimpressed.\u201d\n\nDavid added, \u201cI thought he came out very much for public education.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-trump-working-for-billionaires_us_5b8df3fae4b0511db3db55a2": "Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), right, campaigns for Abdul El-Sayed, a populist doctor running for governor of Michigan.\n\nDETROIT \u2015 When Abdul El-Sayed unpacks the lessons of the 2016 election for Michigan, he likes to talk about his Uncle Rick.\n\nRick, his stepmother\u2019s brother and a resident of rural Gratiot County, voted for Barack Obama twice, and then opted for Donald Trump in 2016. The uncle, a career truck driver, lost his trucking business during the 2008 financial crisis. He thought Trump expressed more urgency about the economic challenges facing people like him than Hillary Clinton did, according to El-Sayed.\n\nLearning that his uncle had voted for a man who has demonized and discriminated against Muslims led to \u201ca bit of an awkward conversation,\u201d El-Sayed recalled in an interview with HuffPost on a Sunday morning last month.\n\nBut Rick was not motivated by hatred, El-Sayed maintained.\n\n\u201cHe is somebody that the economy that has been dominated by these corporations has forgotten \u2015 and he voted for Donald Trump,\u201d El-Sayed continued.\n\nEl-Sayed, 33, the former Detroit health director, is running an uphill battle for Michigan\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Tuesday\u2019s primary. If he defies the odds and defeats both former state Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer and businessman Shri Thanedar, he would be the first Muslim gubernatorial nominee for a major party in American history.\n\nThe Democratic winner in Tuesday\u2019s contest will face one of four Republican contenders. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R), who is endorsed by Trump, leads the GOP race, according to polls.\n\nIf we\u2019re able to empower those people to find common cause, that\u2019s where we start to actually move stuff in our democracy. Abdul El-Sayed\n\nIf El-Sayed had stopped the story about his uncle there it might be easy for skeptics to dismiss him as yet another class reductionist, nostalgic for the days when white men made up a bigger part of the Democratic base and unwilling to acknowledge the gritty realities of structural racism in the American political fabric.\n\nBut El-Sayed took his pitch a step further, arguing, much as Jesse Jackson did in his presidential runs, that it is possible to unite an interracial coalition of low-income and working-class people based on shared recognition of one another\u2019s suffering. It is a theory that does not discount the overbearing power of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and the uniqueness of the black American experience, but one that seeks to build solidarity based on mutual empathy.\n\nSpeaking about the largely rural group of economically marginalized white voters in Michigan and the largely urban, politically neglected black voters from a range of financial backgrounds, El-Sayed lamented, \u201cNever the twain shall meet. They never talk to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re able to empower those people to find common cause, that\u2019s where we start to actually move stuff in our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nBloomberg/Getty Images Democrats are eager to return Michigan to its organized labor roots as Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's second term comes to a close.\n\nRacial Justice, Economic Populism, Last-Minute Momentum\n\nThe long-heralded dream of an interracial, working-class movement for social justice dates at least as far back as Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign, but it has proven far harder to forge in practice.\n\nWhat El-Sayed, a trained physician, brings to the cause that say, a Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might lack, is the ability to speak from the perspective of a person of color, raised in an upper-middle class home, who nonetheless experienced routine discrimination for his skin color and his faith.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, his teammates on a suburban Detroit high school football team bullied him relentlessly for a supposed association with the perpetrators. He winces recalling how a police officer, who found him and his friends playing basketball after hours in a predominantly white neighborhood, clubbed him with a pepper spray bottle and demanded to know what he was doing there.\n\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be forgotten in political conversations,\u201d El-Sayed said, referring to his experience as a Muslim and brown-skinned son of Egyptian immigrants.\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be forgotten in political conversations. Abdul El-Sayed\n\nOn paper then, El-Sayed seems like exactly the kind of economic populist and racial justice advocate that Michigan Democrats need to take back power.\n\nAfter all, voters in the Great Lakes State, once the heart of the labor movement and the New Deal coalition, delivered an upset win for Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary before surprisingly going for Trump in the general election.\n\nIf there is one person capable of winning back the white Obama-Trump voters like El-Sayed\u2019s uncle, and exciting the millennials and black voters in Detroit who stayed home in 2016, surely it\u2019s El-Sayed.\n\nEl-Sayed even has a knack for code-switching that many of his ideological fellow travelers lack \u2015 toggling comfortably between the techno-speak of a policy wonk and the soaring rhetoric of a populist firebrand. Under the direction of policy chief Rhiana Gunn-Wright, his campaign has drafted some of the nation\u2019s most detailed plans for single-payer health care, public broadband, a green energy economy, and tuition-free college for most state residents.\n\nBut for all of El-Sayed\u2019s strengths, including the acclaim for reviving Detroit\u2019s moribund health department, he has struggled to break through in public polls. An NBC News survey conducted in late July had El-Sayed in third place, with 22 percent of the vote to Whitmer\u2019s 31 percent and Thanedar\u2019s 27 percent.\n\nEl-Sayed has experienced a burst of last-minute momentum. He secured the endorsements of Flint-born filmmaker Michael Moore, Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez held packed rallies in the last two weekends of his campaign.\n\nAnd an internal poll released by El-Sayed\u2019s team last week, which assumes a more pro-Sanders electorate than that of the 2016 primary, had him within striking distance of Whitmer. That poll, El-Sayed staffers noted, was conducted prior to Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders\u2019 visits, which they suspect brought additional voters into his corner.\n\nBill Pugliano/Getty Images Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a United Auto Workers convention in Detroit on June 14, 2018.

El-Sayed has been hampered by the odd candidacy of Shri Thanedar, a corporate malefactor whose claimed progressive pedigree is a sham. Thanedar has spent millions on advertising saying he is the \u201cmost progressive\u201d Democrat in the race.\n\nMore importantly, Democrats\u2019 odds-on frontrunner, former Democratic Senate Leader Gretchen Whitmer, simply does not carry the same baggage or evoke the same skepticism among Michigan Democrats as Hillary Clinton did in 2016.\n\nMany Democrats who spoke to HuffPost during a July visit consider Whitmer\u2019s experience a boon, and worried that a left-wing candidate like El-Sayed, untested at the ballot box, could jeopardize an opportunity to undo eight years of unified Republican rule.\n\nThe state\u2019s two-term Republican governor, Rick Snyder, presided over the lead poisoning of Flint\u2019s water supply and managed to make Michigan, once the heart of the American labor movement, a right-to-work state.\n\nNorm Howe, an Ann Arbor-based Democratic activist backing Whitmer, said he feared Michigan\u2019s slide into Southern-style economic conservatism would transform it into \u201cMichissippi.\u201d\n\nEl-Sayed \u201cis a very good speaker and very competent, but he\u2019s got to prove that he can get votes at a lower level [office] first,\u201d Howe said.\n\nI am proud of my progressive record. Gretchen Whitmer\n\nWhitmer, 46, served in Michigan\u2019s legislature from 2001 to 2015, with the last four years as Senate minority leader. She also briefly served as the top prosecutor in Ingham County, where Lansing is located.\n\nWhitmer points to her success negotiating progressive priorities under unified Republican rule as evidence that she is the candidate best equipped to actually pass progressive legislation.\n\nDespite being in the legislative minority, she helped negotiate the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act in 2013, and a modest increase in the minimum wage, which is now $9.25 an hour.\n\nWhen Whitmer could not stop conservative legislation, she protested it. In December 2013, Whitmer spoke publicly for the first time about being raped in college during a floor speech protesting a law requiring additional insurance to get reimbursement for an abortion.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my progressive record,\u201d Whitmer told a crowd of activists at the mid-July Michigan Democratic Party picnic in Milford.\n\nWhitmer, who has the backing of nearly every labor union and Democratic elected official in the state, is running on a platform of economic reforms, including the creation of an infrastructure bank to fix the states\u2019 decrepit roads, raising the minimum wage to $15 and a plan for two years of debt-free college or trade school. Although the progressive base has raised its demands since the 2016 election, just a few years ago, those proposals would have put Whitmer at the party\u2019s progressive vanguard.\n\n\u201cShe would be a breath of fresh air for the state of Michigan,\u201d said Jimmy Womack, a Detroit-based pastor and former colleague of Whitmer\u2019s in the legislature. \u201cShe works hard, she\u2019s experienced.\u201d\n\nWDIV From left to right: Shri Thanedar, Abdul El-Sayed and Gretchen Whitmer participate in a live television debate on July 19, 2018.\n\nHunger For Change\n\nWhitmer\u2019s biggest policy differences from El-Sayed and Thanedar involve health care and charter schools. She\u2019s not for single-payer health care, while her opponents are, and she promises to crack down on for-profit charter schools through regulation. El-Sayed and Thanedar have vowed to end them.\n\nEl-Sayed has also hammered Whitmer for accepting corporate PAC money, and benefitting from a fundraiser held by Michigan Blue Cross Blue Shield executives.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s campaign has responded by pointing to the volume of contributions El-Sayed has received from individual corporate executives and his disproportionate reliance on out-of-state donors.\n\nIf El-Sayed wins, it will be thanks to a field and digital operation modeled on Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential run. With the help of Claire Sandberg, a Sanders campaign alumna serving as deputy campaign manager, El-Sayed is trying to expand the primary electorate by turning out young progressives and other infrequent voters who often don\u2019t show up in traditional polling data.\n\nHe also may benefit from some older, longtime voters\u2019 hunger for change.\n\nDorothy Wright, a retired AT&T operator in Detroit, was planning to vote for Whitmer because of a friend\u2019s recommendation.

Texas last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate when Lloyd Bentsen won re-election in 1988.\n\nIn a write-up of its televised political events, CNN announced: \u201cCNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash will moderate a live, one-hour town hall with Democratic Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) unveiled a landmark resolution cementing the pillars of an unprecedented program to zero out planet-warming emissions and restore the middle-class prosperity of postwar America that the original New Deal helped spur.\n\nJust three months after calls for a Green New Deal electrified a long-stagnant debate on climate policy, the Democratic lawmakers released the six-page document outlining plans to cut global emissions 40 to 60 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and neutralize human-caused greenhouse gases entirely by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday is a big day for workers in Appalachia,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cToday is a good day for children who have been breathing dirty air in the Bronx.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious, if measured, clarion call for action that, if accomplished, would transform the United States into the leader in decarbonizing and clear a path forward for the world to avert catastrophic warming.\n\nThe joint resolution stakes out a \u201cten-year national mobilization\u201d plan to build \u201csmart\u201d grids and rapidly increase the share of American power generated from solar and wind from 10 percent today to as close to 100 percent as possible over the next decade. The plan reframes tired talk of repairing the nation\u2019s crumbling bridges, highways and ports as a crisis in a new era of billion-dollar storms. It gets local, demanding upgrades to \u201call existing U.S. buildings\u201d to \u201cachieve maximum\u201d efficiency with energy and water use.\n\nThat holistic framing extends to the way the document describes emissions, mentioning \u201ccarbon\u201d just once and instead using the term \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d which includes methane, nitrous oxide and ozone.\n\nEnergy and infrastructure issues are the centerpiece of the resolution, with explicit goals of overhauling the transportation sector \u2015 the country\u2019s biggest source of climate pollution \u2015 to expand public transit and high-speed rail and to spur a \u201cclean\u201d manufacturing boom with a particular focus on electric vehicles.\n\nBut, unlike most existing Green New Deal concepts, food and water are focal points. The resolution proposes \u201cbuilding a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food\u201d and \u201cguaranteeing universal access to clean water.\u201d To meet those goals, the document describes \u201cworking collaboratively with farmers and ranchers\u201d to reduce agricultural pollution with \u201csustainable farming and land use practices that increase soil health\u201d and \u201csupporting family farming.\u201d\n\nUnabashedly progressive ideals anchor the resolution. A section outlining guidelines for future Green New Deal bills reads like a laundry list of populist policies, including everything from ramped-up antitrust enforcement \u2015 \u201censuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by\u201d monopolies \u2015 to a vastly expanded social safety net, \u201cproviding all people of the United States high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security, and access to clean water, air and healthy and affordable food, and nature.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution seems designed for broad appeal. The fact that Markey, a liberal stalwart who co-authored the last major climate bill Democrats tried to pass in 2009, is the lead Senate sponsor shows the insurgent Ocasio-Cortez wing is building bridges with the old guard.\n\nReuters Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) was the co-sponsor of the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill Democrats nearly passed a decade ago. Now he's spearheading the resolution effort with Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe resolution itself avoids controversial technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, instead calling for low-tech solutions, such as large-scale preservation and planting new forests to absorb carbon already in the atmosphere. In a news release, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team said carbon capture \u201ctechnology to date has not proven effective.\u201d\n\nThe resolution contains more obvious compromises. In a departure from the initial protests that gave rise to the Green New Deal, the document avoids explicitly calling for ending fossil fuel development. It leaves open the possibility of keeping existing nuclear power plants in place until after the initial 10-year mobilization plan is complete, admitting that \u201cwe are currently unsure if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant that fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution is silent on any individual technology which can move us toward a solution on this problem,\u201d Markey said at the press conference. \u201cThis is a resolution that does not have individual prescriptions in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are open to whatever works,\u201d he added later.\n\nBucking the prevailing bipartisan orthodoxy on climate policy, the resolution makes no mention of pricing carbon. The release stated that the \u201cdoor is not closed for market-based incentives or a diverse array of policy levers to play a role in the Green New Deal, but it would be a small role.\u201d\n\nTo supporters, those candid admissions showed that the document represented a feasible first step toward legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is how green socialists will govern,\u201d said Greg Carlock, the researcher at the think tank Data for Progress, whose Green New Deal blueprint from September resembles the resolution. \u201cIt will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe resolution dropped with poignant timing. During his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump ignored climate change and touted a fossil fuel agenda projected to put the world on course for cataclysmic warming, analysis by researchers at more than a dozen environmental groups projects found. On Wednesday, House Democrats kicked off two hearings on climate change less than two hours before NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2018 the fourth-hottest year ever recorded.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the resolution\u2019s prospects of passing. The GOP controls the Senate, and Republican opposition to the Green New Deal started to crystallize at Wednesday\u2019s hearings.\n\nEven among Democrats, who control the House, support is far from guaranteed. By Thursday morning, the resolution garnered more than 60 House Democrats and at least nine Senate Democrats signed onto the resolution. But in a Politico interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is.\u201d Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace issued statements that tempered their support by calling for explicit fossil fuel phase-outs.\n\nThe sort of Green New Deal the resolution describes poses an existential threat to entrenched, deep-pocketed industries that donate to Democrats. Building a constituency powerful enough to challenge fossil fuel producers, automakers and utilities requires support from the labor movement.\n\nYet the influential building-trade unions are skeptical of any policy that impedes fossil fuel infrastructure, a reliable source of lucrative contract jobs. The resolution aims to ease those worries, \u201censuring that Green New Deal mobilization creates high-quality union jobs that pay prevailing wages, hire local workers, offer training and advancement opportunities and guarantee wage and benefit parity for workers affected by the transition.\u201d\n\nBut that rhetoric isn\u2019t new, and it does little to assuage festering concerns. Renewable energy jobs tend to pay less and use fewer unionized workers than pipeline or coal-train gigs. The problem, too, is the steady erosion of labor laws over the past few decades, diminishing hopes that clean-energy work could easily reach wage parity with fossil fuels under existing statutes. A Green New Deal, in that sense, necessitates changes to labor law almost as dramatic as those governing energy and infrastructure. To that end, the resolution directly calls for \u201cstrengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe potential opposition from building trades hasn\u2019t made the Green New Deal any less popular with Democrats\u2019 swelling pool of 2020 contenders. Nearly every declared and likely candidate \u2015 former Vice President Joe Biden is a notable exception \u2015 has offered an endorsement of the Green New Deal in some form or another.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who threw his support behind the Green New Deal resolution last week, is one potential candidate. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) backed the Green New Deal in December, tying support for its climate goals to a jobs guarantee bill he already introduced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) last month sent a letter to the Republican in charge of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee outlining her support for a Green New Deal. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a likely frontrunner when he declares his candidacy, is considering legislation of his own on a Green New Deal.\n\nOthers are vague. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro all said they support the \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cconcept\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nThe resolution may draw clearer battle lines.\n\n\u201cI expect that we\u2019re going to see a lot of people saying they approve of the spirit, they love the bill, they just question whether it could pass as legislation,\u201d said R.L. Miller, president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a starting point.\u201d\n\nThis is how green socialists will govern. It will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious. Greg Carlock, Data for Progress\n\nThe Green New Deal, originally coined in the mid-2000s as a term connoting a way to bridge the environmental and economic goals, re-emerged last year as Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing Democrats ran on unabashedly progressive visions of curbing climate-changing emissions and eradicating poverty in the same stroke. In November, activists from the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats staged sit-in protests in Democratic leaders\u2019 offices, demanding they make a Green New Deal a policy priority in the newly flipped House.\n\nOcasio-Cortez joined the protests, and soon after unveiled a resolution calling for a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House. Pelosi rejected the plan even as roughly 40 Democrats agreed to support the resolution. Instead, she revived a decade-old select committee on climate change, and put a backbench moderate Democrat in charge of the panel.\n\nBut the demonstrations thrust the Green New Deal into the national spotlight. It proved popular. In December, 81 percent of registered voters said they supported a plan to generate 100 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity from clean sources within the next 10 years, upgrade the U.S. power grid, invest in energy efficiency and renewable technology, and provide training for jobs in the new, green economy, according to a poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University. That included 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans, with an eyebrow-raising 57 percent of conservative Republicans in agreement.\n\nAnother poll published last week found voters narrowly supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThe left is putting its heads together on how we can actually govern, how we can go from an opposition force, a resistance force, to one that can do things of the many, rather than the 1 percent,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst at 350.org. Speaking of the resolution, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in this.\u201d\n\nStephen O\u2019Hanlon, a Sunrise Movement spokesman, downplayed the disparities between the resolution and some of the initial demands his fellow activists made \u2015 namely the lack of an explicit fossil fuel phase-out or a hard 2030 deadline for 100 percent renewables.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bill, which means there\u2019s a lot of details to be worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still feel very good about the pieces that are still being figured out.\u201d\n\nThe resolution includes justice provisions that would be difficult to criticize. It echoes the 2015 Dakota Access pipeline protests that Ocasio-Cortez credits with inspiring her to run for office. In one section, it calls for \u201cobtaining free, prior and informed consent for Indigenous peoples for all decisions that impact them and their traditional territories.\u201d The document opens with a pledge to \u201cpromote justice and equity by stopping current, prevent future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez said at the press conference that her focus was on \u201cfully funding coal miners\u2019 pensions\u201d and \u201ccleaning the water in West Virginia.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution looks beyond the Green New Deal\u2019s impact at home. One provision, as HuffPost reported Tuesday, calls for the United States to \u201cpromoting the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding, and services with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nThat could spark a new debate over how central climate change should be to the progressive foreign policy vision taking shaping ahead of the 2020 election. Though China surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide over a decade ago, Americans boast far larger CO2 footprints per capita and remain the world\u2019s largest historic emitters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have a discussion about the debt we owe to the international community for our reckless treatment of the environment,\u201d said Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress. \u201cIt will be a tough discussion but it shows the way Ocasio-Cortez is changing the discussion.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/former-dnc-ceo-race-diversity-2020-candidates_us_5c5b4c2ce4b00187b557df5b": "Leah Daughtry is optimistic. The ordained minister and political operative \u2014 who made history as the only person to have been CEO of the Democratic National Convention twice (2008 and 2016) \u2014 is animatedly talking about the field of Democratic candidates already vying for the presidency.\n\n\u201cI think all of the candidates, particularly the Democratic side, understand that you cannot win the nomination without the African-American vote,\u201d Daughtry said on the eve of Black History Month.\n\nDaughtry knows what it takes to listen to and captivate minority voters. The co-author of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics got an early start in politics under civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, helping to run his presidential campaign in New Hampshire in 1984 when she was still a senior at Dartmouth College.\n\n\u201cHe was the first figure I understood or had close interaction with on a national political level. He changed my definition of winning,\u201d she said when we meet at her family\u2019s historic House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn, N.Y. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the White House in \u201984 or \u201988. But we won something different instead. Hundreds of thousands of people who were registered to vote, who were energized by his message, who he brought into the room through an inclusive outreach \u2014 we were able to change the face of the nation.\u201d\n\nThis year, the 2020 Democratic candidates are arguably more representative of the country they serve than at any other point in history \u2014 more women and people of color are running for president than ever before.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there are any candidates who embody \u201cperfect\u201d progressivism (which, while impossible, seems to be the litmus test politicians have to meet in these ever-embattled partisan times). And there has already been a slew of mea culpas from 2020 hopefuls: Sen. Elizabeth Warren has apologized for her DNA test results that suggested indigenous ancestry; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said sorry for her previous immigration stances (they \u201ccertainly weren\u2019t empathetic,\u201d she conceded), Sen. Kamala Harris has been sheepish about her hawkish prosecutorial remarks in deriding \u201cschools not prisons\u201d campaigns, and Sen. Bernie Sanders asked for forgiveness in the wake of criticism about sexual harassment within his 2016 campaign.\n\nFor Daughtry, apologies only go so far.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/billionaires-hatred-donald-trump_us_5c5c99e3e4b03afe8d65afff": "It\u2019s hard to admit, but President Donald Trump has triggered progress on a long-simmering issue: economic inequality.\n\nThe notion that the rich \u2015 billionaires in particular \u2015 have too much at the expense of too many has taken off in recent weeks. There\u2019s talk of \u201cbanning billionaires,\u201d and in the U.S. there are serious \u2015 and popular \u2015 policy proposals looking at how to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy, most notably from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAmericans have actually long supported raising taxes on the wealthy, surveys show. But for years, the ultra-rich, Republicans and anti-tax extremists like Grover Norquist have kept that popular sentiment at bay, partly with rhetoric about freedom and partly by philanthropic deeds, not to mention good PR to portray themselves as benevolent, self-made geniuses.\n\nNow that Trump\u2019s in office. The tide has turned.\n\n\u201cThe current occupant of the White House has rather taken the sheen off the billionaires,\u201d said Justin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s easier today to believe that a bunch of them are grifters rather than the value-creating entrepreneurs that we might hope for.\u201d\n\nJacquelyn Martin/Associated Press Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, hold up a sheet of new $1 bills on Nov. 15, 2017, at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington.\n\nIn the past, Americans wanted to tax the rich to pay for specific policies. These days, the reasoning goes that taxing the ultra-wealthy will tamp down extreme inequality, said Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing more willingness to say it\u2019s just a moral issue that someone shouldn\u2019t start out with that much of an advantage in life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe recent popularity of tax-the-rich policies isn\u2019t simply a reaction to Trump, Grossman added, but part of a natural tendency in American politics for public opinion to swing in opposition to whichever party is in power. \u201cPublic opinion moves \u2018thermostatically,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Republicans are in office and policy moves to the right, public opinion moves leftward.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s fair to say that the Democratic Party\u2019s reaction to Trump has been more extreme than it would\u2019ve been under, say, a President Jeb Bush. Trump has energized progressives on issues, like women\u2019s rights, in resistance to the president, which has inspired record numbers of women to run for office. He\u2019s also been a catalyst for environmental issues, in a way. Before Trump took office, activists and scientists had trouble getting attention for climate issues, but now it\u2019s become much easier, in part thanks to opposition to Trump, FiveThirtyEight recently reported.\n\nOf course, there are a host of other non-Trump reasons why tax-the-rich ideas are taking off now, including a rise in economic inequality that is hard to ignore and the work of economists, such as Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who\u2019ve been able to demonstrate, with hard data, how bad the situation has become.\n\nThere\u2019s also the lingering effects of the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, which pushed Democrats to the left on these issues. Sanders proposed raising taxes on wealthy Americans and railed against income inequality.\n\nAnd outrage over inequality really hasn\u2019t gone away since the Great Recession a decade ago led to the protests of Occupy Wall Street.\n\nStephen Crowley/The New York Times via ASSOCIATED PRESS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, with his wife, Hilary Geary Ross.\n\nIn the background, as these longer-term trends play out, is our super-rich president and his super-rich Cabinet. They\u2019ve demonstrated repeatedly how out of touch they are with regular people.\n\nMost recently, during the partial government shutdown, the multimillionaire (and reported grifter) Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had his \u201clet them eat cake\u201d moment when he told CNBC that he couldn\u2019t understand why furloughed workers would go to food banks when they could instead get loans to carry them through the loss of pay.\n\nTrump himself helped further along the out-of-touch narrative by claiming that grocery stores would work with these unpaid government employees to help them get food if they were short on cash.\n\nFormer Goldman Sachs executive and millionaire Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s wife, Louise Linton, caught flak in 2017 for comments she made online essentially boasting about the taxes she and her husband pay. \u201cPretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours,\u201d she commented on an Instagram post, responding to someone who had criticized her.\n\nBeyond image, keep in mind that Trump\u2019s singular policy achievement is a massive tax cut that has mostly benefited corporations. Bloomberg recently reported that the nation\u2019s largest banks got a $21 billion \u201cwindfall\u201d from the legislation but wound up cutting employees anyway.\n\nFinally, Trump\u2019s set himself apart from all other modern presidents by keeping his tax returns private \u2015 inadvertently perhaps shining a light on how the rich often get away with not paying their fair share.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-filibuster-nuclear_us_5c5a286de4b00187b5560591": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Many Democrats say they oppose changing Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on legislation, otherwise known as the filibuster, despite some calls from the left urging them to do so to more easily advance their agenda in 2021.\n\nAmbitious Democratic proposals like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d or the Green New Deal stand little chance of becoming law in the near future given near-unanimous Republican opposition and the Senate\u2019s long-standing supermajority requirement. Even if Democrats manage to claw back to power in the Senate and recapture the White House in 2020, the GOP would likely prevent them from advancing to a final vote by using the filibuster.\n\nThat\u2019s why some on the left are pushing Democrats to either be honest with voters about the chances of passing major legislation they\u2019ve introduced or simply rip the Band-Aid off and ditch a rule that doesn\u2019t actually appear in the Constitution anyway.\n\n\u201cThe Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. [Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell] will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything. If Dems win the WH & Senate in 2020, they should nuke the 60-vote threshold on day one and get on with it,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for ex-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said last month.\n\nOther progressives like Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice have argued that Democrats stand to benefit more from eliminating the filibuster because Republicans are generally less likely to propose sweeping changes in domestic policy due to their conservative ideology.\n\nBut nearly a dozen Democrats rejected those arguments in interviews on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, calling the filibuster a critical tool that helps foster bipartisanship, as well as a means of guarding against political passions that can bubble up in the House and the executive branch. Many of those Democratic senators also expressed concern about a scenario in which Republicans once again controlled both Congress and the White House.\n\nIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)\n\n\u201cIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive to the nation. So while I understand the frustration ... I think the consequences of getting rid of it are too great,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday.\n\nIndeed, if the filibuster had not been on the books during the first two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans could have passed a whole host of legislation Democrats most likely would not liked to have seen become law \u2015 including, possibly, funding for his border wall.\n\n\u201cWhat you might think today would be in your favor, might not be in your favor tomorrow,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who was just elected to a six-year term, added on Tuesday.\n\nSome Democrats still harbor regrets over the decision in 2013 to unilaterally end the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. Democratic leaders said at the time they were forced to take the step to confirm a number of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees given unprecedented GOP obstruction from people like McConnell. Reid, who pulled the trigger on the rule change, still maintains that it was the right thing to do. But now that Republicans are confirming young, conservative judicial nominees at a historic pace under the Trump administration, some Democrats say there is reason for caution about going even further.\n\n\u201cI would remind people there was a lot of interest in getting rid of the filibuster for judges and for the Supreme Court, and that has not served us well,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked whether she supported eliminating the filibuster on legislation.\n\nMany 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls also share concerns about going nuclear to kill the filibuster. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the most recent entry in the field, said last week he would \u201cpersonally resist efforts to get rid of it.\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said last month she would consider ending the filibuster. In the meantime, the presidential candidate said that lacking 60 votes \u201cmeans you haven\u2019t done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a potential White House contender, has endorsed several progressive proposals on health care and climate change. He has also recently introduced legislation that would drastically expand the estate tax on the wealthy, a proposal he says would would raise $2.2 trillion. But the senator declined to address how to go about getting such proposals passed into law on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit speculative. I need to worry about what\u2019s happening in the country right now. That\u2019s a little bit into the future,\u201d Sanders said when asked whether he supported killing the filibuster.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, was the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who did not rule out the prospect of going nuclear in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cEverything stays on the table. You keep it all on the table. Don\u2019t take anything off the table,\u201d Warren said in an interview with Politico last week.\n\nThe debate over the filibuster is likely to heat up in the Democratic primary over the next two years with many progressives in the race floating a wish list of progressive proposals on everything from health care and taxes, to voting rights and climate change. But some Democrats think the conversation isn\u2019t exactly productive for the party when it comes to running Washington.\n\n\u201cSome of us have to think about governing. ... In terms of nuts and bolts, in terms of making this place work better, I don\u2019t think that talk is helpful,\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting he was not running for president.\n\nThe likelihood of ending the 60-vote threshold on legislation is extremely small in the near future due to bipartisan opposition. Trump repeatedly pushed McConnell to kill the filibuster last year in order to build the wall, for example. The Kentucky senator has resisted the president\u2019s entreaties, estimating in an interview last year that two-thirds of his caucus oppose doing so.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster, which has been around for a long time, is a problem. And it does, I think, generate on many occasions kind of a bipartisan solution, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always bad for the country,\u201d McConnell said in the interview.\n\nStill, progressives don\u2019t view the threat of a filibuster as an impediment to proceeding with legislation like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In fact, they argue that building political support for big new ideas often takes time, and the traditional place where that has occurred in the past is in the lower chamber.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-electability-beat-trump-2020_us_5c589812e4b087104756966f": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic voters are debating which of their potential primary candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, is in the best position to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic voters\u2019 singular goal in picking a presidential nominee in 2020 is the defeat of President Donald Trump, overriding ideological concerns and policy disagreements, according to a new poll released Monday.\n\nThe survey, conducted by New Jersey\u2019s Monmouth University, asked Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independent voters nationwide if they preferred a candidate with whom they agreed on most issues but who would have a hard time beating Trump or a candidate with whom they did not agree on most issues but who would be stronger against Trump. Fifty-six percent wanted the stronger candidate against Trump, even if they disagreed on most issues. Just 33 percent wanted a candidate whom they agreed with, even if that individual would struggle to defeat the president.\n\nThe finding is a shift from the electoral priorities expressed by both Democratic and Republican voters in 2016. But it matches what Democratic operatives across the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have been telling reporters for months.\n\n\u201cIn prior elections, voters from both parties consistently prioritized shared values over electability when selecting a nominee,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u201cIt looks like Democrats may be willing to flip that equation in 2020 because of their desire to defeat Trump. This is something to pay close attention to when primary voters really start tuning in to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: No consensus has developed among Democratic voters or party operatives over what type of candidate is best equipped to defeat Trump.\n\nShould it be a candidate who can win back the white working-class voters who defected to Trump in 2016? Then Democrats might want former Vice President Joe Biden, who is basing his potential candidacy around his appeal to that demographic. A candidate of color, like Texas\u2019 Juli\u00e1n Castro or California Sen. Kamala Harris, might be best equipped to win Republican-controlled Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona. Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have long argued that he would have won in 2016, and excitement around his policy platform could fire up working-class voters of all races.\n\nA report last month from Working America, an organizing group backed by the AFL-CIO, found \u201cwidespread anxiety and uncertainty about Democrats\u2019 prospects of defeating the president in 2020, and a lack of consensus on which candidate could best compete against Trump\u201d among working-class Democratic voters in Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe talk about electability was pervasive,\u201d Matt Morrison, Working America\u2019s executive director, told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThere was no clear consensus on what direction Democrats wanted to move in the presidential contest.\u201d\n\nContrast this focus on finding the most electable candidate with how people approached the 2016 election: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from shortly before the Iowa caucuses found just 16 percent of Democratic Party voters said choosing a candidate who could beat the GOP nominee was their top concern.\n\nElectability is already shaping early messaging on the 2020 primaries. For instance, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who both represent big cities on the East Coast, are playing up their rural roots, hoping to show Iowans they can win outside the most progressive parts of the country.\n\nThe consensus within both parties on who is electable and who isn\u2019t was torn apart by the results of the last presidential election, when Trump squeaked by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even as much of the GOP establishment predicted political doom. But while GOP primary voters seemingly responded to their party\u2019s presidential losses in 2008 and 2012 by throwing electability concerns out the window in 2016, Democratic primary voters in the 2018 midterms largely selected the same candidates that party bosses in Washington believed were most likely to win.\n\nThe Monmouth poll also found that 61 percent of Democratic women were willing to set aside their policy preferences to get a candidate capable of defeating the president, compared to just 45 percent of Democratic men.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-state-of-the-union_us_5c5a0ac8e4b0871047587c34": "Alex Wong via Getty Images Democratic presidential candidate and Sen.

But don\u2019t get it twisted because he ain\u2019t one of your lil\u2019 friends.\n\nIn true Sagittarian fashion, he\u2019s brutally honest, and though his punchlines feed you like comfort food, he\u2019s not biting his tongue for anyone. This held true in his early days delivering his \u201cFurious Thoughts\u201d on YouTube, and its consistent today as he drags everyone from the president to trash boyfriends with a firm moral compass on \u201cThe Read\u201d with his co-host Crissle West.\n\nJokes aside, the Miami native is a pioneer in helping usher in a wave of unapologetic young black podcasters in an industry dominated by whiteness. Since launching their show in 2013, Fury has started some crucial conversations around the intersection of blackness with sex, gender, relationships and mental health.\n\nThough nonchalant about his contributions, Kid Fury is black history in the flesh. As a part of HuffPost\u2019s \u201cWe Built This\u201d series for Black History Month, Fury discussed with us how comedy saved his life, that black people should have free therapy and his production with Lena Waithe.\n\nThe name of this project is \u201cWe Built This.\u201d What have you built?\n\nI think I\u2019ve built a platform for myself to express humor and to just live as authentically as I know how, and to also invite myself to learn new things about people in the world, and myself.\n\nA lot of people were introduced to you by your videos on YouTube and how unapologetic, and how dope, your voice was. What made you start doing these videos, and how did you find your voice through them?\n\nI started doing videos on YouTube because I had a blog at the time, which was essentially a comedy blog about pop culture, basic stuff that I do now, and I just wanted to try something new, and I was hoping to bring more traffic to the website, and it took me a while \u2019cause I thought that I was unattractive, and I hated the sound of my voice, and I was just insecure about it, but eventually I took a leap of faith like one of many leaps of faith I\u2019ve taken, and it\u2019s just worked out, I guess.\n\nI think that\u2019s something that is so common among anybody who has been or felt othered. And I think a lot of that has to do with how we see ourself represented growing up. What were the images in which you saw yourself represented as a child?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I saw many images that reminded me too much of myself as a kid. I know that I saw lots of great black sitcoms that I gravitated toward, my family played \u201cMartin\u201d all of the time, and I watched \u201cIn Living Color\u201d growing up. I loved \u201cMoesha\u201d and lots of characters like that. I don\u2019t remember seeing many black gay characters on TV when I was younger that weren\u2019t the butt of a joke. Maybe \u201cNoah\u2019s Arc\u201d was one of the first scripted shows that I remember that was like, oh, this kind of makes me feel like this is my community.\n\nSo, yeah I think that\u2019s another part of the reason why I do what I am doing, and I try to be as open and honest about myself as I can because I would like for more of that to be able to happen for black queer people. I think the axis that we live on kind of revolves around fear of judgment, and worrying about whether or not we\u2019re safe or are people going to accept us.\n\nI think it\u2019s kind of hard for a lot of us in the community to just feel comfortable to live authentically on whatever space, but I\u2019m trying my best, I guess.\n\nPhotography by Kris Graves for HuffPost; Grooming by Monae Everett\n\nWe were briefly talking downstairs about how hard comedy is. What led you to this profession?\n\nComedy is the thing I think that saved my life many times. I was always really enamored by standup as an art form, I haven\u2019t even really practiced it as much as I\u2019d like to, or as much as many other standup comedians do, but I always loved Def Comedy Jam. I loved Bernie Mac, I loved Redd Foxx, I loved Martin, of course, everybody with the last name Wayans. Even Kathy Griffin, God bless her and her career. I just always really was attracted to the idea of getting up in front of people and just making them feel waves of discomfort and then sheer exhilarating laughter. I just always really respected that as a performance art.\n\nAfter I moved to New York, I decided that I was just gonna try it. I kept putting off standup for the longest time just out of fear, again of judgment and failure, and eventually, again, I took a leap of faith and threw myself off of the ledge and just said I\u2019m gonna try it, and I did, and it was fun, and I liked to do more of it in the future.\n\nI have heard you say a couple times when critiquing comedians who make really lazy jokes at the expense of marginalized communities that it is a skill and an art to kind of toe that line without crossing it, like so many people do. I think that we\u2019re seeing with so many artists like yourself, like Yvonne Orji, a new wave of ... and maybe wave isn\u2019t the right word, but a fresher voice in which we are seeing, or hearing, comedy more inclusive of different black experiences that we haven\u2019t seen before. How do you get to that place and perfect it? What was the message that you were trying to say with your comedy?\n\nWell, I think that most of my comedy revolves around evaluating the world that we live in, and us as people, the decisions that we make, the ways that we\u2019re sort of wired as a society. I feel like that\u2019s pretty much what every comedian does, but I think that what I mean when I say that is that ... the thing I love so much about comedy or performing comedy is that if you really try, if you look at it as homework, or a serious project, there are ways that you can write a joke about almost any topic, whether it\u2019s sensitive or not, in a smart way that can make anybody laugh.\n\nI feel like the best jokes are the jokes that take place around really uncomfortable territory. And the best comedians are the ones who are able to perform those jokes in smart ways that aren\u2019t just typical and offensive and lazy. It\u2019s really easy to write a joke about any number of stereotypes or prejudices and then just be like, well, you know I\u2019m a comedian, so I can say that. I think it\u2019s way more impressive to completely change the way that people think, or make people think, period.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not really challenging yourself in that regard, I don\u2019t even really know why you do it, personally. That\u2019s just me.\n\nAnd you say that comedy saved your life. I think that in talking to a lot of my peers, and just looking at overall the response and the reception to \u201cThe Read\u201d since it started six years ago, that podcast has helped so many people. And for a lot of black folks, it was like our introduction to podcasts. Do you ever sit back and reflect on the impact and kind of the doors that you and Crissle opened?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not really good at giving myself credit or patting myself on the back. Crissle is kind of similar in that regard as well. I too didn\u2019t really know much of anything about podcasts when we started, as I said before on the show, and in many other places, it was something for me to do. I moved here from Florida, and I had little to no money, and I didn\u2019t really have a plan, and it was offered to me, and I thought that it sounded better than doing nothing.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t really look at it as me having this impact as changing the game or whatever, I\u2019m just more-so excited that there are people who are now expressing their opinions or looking at podcasting as a way to go after things that they\u2019re passionate about. \u2019Cause there are a lot of people who are doing comedy podcasts or pop culture podcasts sort of for the sake of it, or because they think that they\u2019re entertaining, and I think that that\u2019s great too, but then you have people who are like, \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been really passionate about making cupcakes.\u201d Or something like that, and, \u201cI started this podcast about baking.\u201d\n\nAnything that has just allowed people to get out of the norm of their 9-to-5 or their typical going on in the day, even if it\u2019s not something they do professionally, it\u2019s just something that you find fun, or enlightening or whatever. My dad always told me that we should never really have a goal to continue to work under other people, or we should always at least strive to do things for ourself, have something that is ours that we\u2019re passionate about that we put energy into every single day. And I\u2019ve never really forgotten that, and I think that that\u2019s kind of another part of the reason I have always tried to do my own thing, and just have my own space, and in many ways I didn\u2019t really know if it could make me money. If it could be a career, if it ever would turn into anything more than me just talkin\u2019 shit. But I just knew that it made me feel less insignificant and looked over.\n\nI\u2019m just really honestly blessed and grateful to be in a position where I can take care of myself from the things that I started doing however long ago, when I was 18 or whatever.\n\nPhotography by Kris Graves for HuffPost; Grooming by Monae Everett\n\nOne thing that I really respect about the work that you do is the fact that as you climb, you\u2019re building with those in your circle, and it\u2019s a synergy. You have \u201cThe Friend Zone,\u201d you have all these other different [podcasters], and y\u2019all are supporting each other. That\u2019s a conversation that isn\u2019t delved into deep enough. What is the importance of lifting as you climb?\n\nI\u2019m not even really sure how to answer that simply because it was never anything that I really thought of as more than having certain people around me that I\u2019m, like, do you know that you\u2019re really funny, or do you know that you have something to offer? And a couple of these people already knew that, and were completely going to be in the right place at the right time regardless, and some other people, some friends I might\u2019ve been, like, \u201cBitch, in some way or somehow you need to show people that you\u2019re hilarious, or you could cook, or you can fight, or whatever.\u201d\n\nIt was never anything specifically thought of as, I want to lift up my community, and we\u2019re all going to walk into the sunset together, but I do think that we\u2019re almost conditioned as black people to think that there\u2019s only one spot and that we can\u2019t really encourage one another, or support one another, or hire one another, or whatever.\n\nSo I think that it\u2019s easy for some of us to kind of get caught up in our own thing and not even really consider others. I\u2019m the type of person who just believes what\u2019s mine is mine, what\u2019s meant for me is what\u2019s meant for me, and what you\u2019re doing to my north, south, east or west really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me at the end of the day.\n\nSo I don\u2019t really have a problem high-fivin\u2019 people, friends or non-friends. If I think that you genuinely have something to offer, if I think that you are genuinely doing something of quality, why should I not just be happy for you?\n\nYour browser does not support this video.\n\nYou\u2019re a comedian who talks about therapy. Not only talk about it from a humorous perspective but also from a real perspective. I think that those two, therapy and comedy, haven\u2019t historically gone hand-in-hand because when we think of comedians and their personal lives, we think of the Richard Pryors, as far as having dark shit that you don\u2019t deal with unless you\u2019re onstage. So how has therapy enhanced your career as a comedian?\n\nI think that therapy has more-so enhanced personal decisions that I make, and it\u2019s helped me to learn how to be more productive, and it\u2019s helped me to learn to deal with just certain struggles that have, internally, emotionally, mentally, that keep me from enhancing my comedy or from performing in any way at 100 percent.\n\nMy psychiatrist and I, we talk about my work often. But most of the help that I get from her is personal stuff that I\u2019ve then learned to put into action in my life that helps me to just handle life better so that I can go out into the world and do what I need to do. And I\u2019ve never really had an issue with discussing that stuff just because I feel like nobody has ever really ... nobody really makes me feel as bad about myself as I do.\n\nPeople have been able to really cut me before. I\u2019m not impervious to words, but nobody really makes me feel as low as I do, even if you say something terrible to me or about me. I allow that stuff to be internalized and take over my day or my emotion. So you\u2019re not really gonna make me feel bad about me saying that I go to a therapist every week, or that I\u2019m on meds or that sometimes I feel like a crazy person. What is the worst thing you could possibly say to me about that? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care.\n\nAnd I think that so many of us, especially black people, honestly, therapy for black people should be free in this country. Honestly, we shouldn\u2019t even have to pay for it because who\u2019s a black American that does not need therapy, and we again, as people, are conditioned to think that it\u2019s a waste of time. It\u2019s a waste of money. It\u2019s almost blasphemous because you got Jesus right there, and he\u2019s all of the therapy you need. All of these things.\n\nPhotography by Kris Graves for HuffPost; Grooming by Monae Everett\n\nI have, even my own family, it was kind of a bit of an adjustment for a little while at first when I told them that I was going to therapy, and I was taking medication, and all of this stuff. But I know that it genuinely helps me, and it makes me feel better, and it makes me feel like I can get up and out of my bed in the day, and be active like a normal human being. So I don\u2019t really care about how anybody else feels about it.\n\nAnd, honestly, most comedians have so much darkness built up in them, which we were talking about. And a lot of times that\u2019s what gravitates us toward comedy. It shouldn\u2019t even be shocking that I\u2019m in therapy because A: I\u2019m black, B: I\u2019m gay, C: I\u2019m American, D: Donald Trump is the president. Again, I shouldn\u2019t even have to pay for the therapy.\n\nI\u2019ve been saying for the longest that my reparations need to come in the form of my student loan debt wiped out. Free health care, period. And also an 800 credit score.\n\nI feel like that\u2019s the least ...\n\nThe damn least.\n\nThe least that this country could do. Honestly. I mean, we were literally promised things, but I mean, at least you could give us health care and erase this debt, but you know ... the wall. Yup.\n\nWho are the black history makers, either living or in the ancestral plain, who inspire you to continue to do the work that you do?\n\nRichard Pryor. Coretta. Bernie. Of course, the Queen Beyonce, just because her work ethic is so stupid. It\u2019s so typical of me to stop here, but just if I could work at anything that I did ... if I wanted to make jeans for a living, and I worked at it the way that she does, I would have the highest sewing ... anyway, Beyonce. Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Sasha and Malia, Bo. What\u2019s the other dog\u2019s name? Sorry, other dog, both Bo and Bo\u2019s sibling. Missy Elliott. Rumi, Sir, Blue. Trina. This is one of those things where I feel like I could name so many people, any black, so many black people inspire me truthfully. Regina Hall, Issa Rae, Marsai Martin \u2015 go see \u201cLittle.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m the type of person, this is gonna sound so stupid and corny, but I\u2019m genuinely the type of person that just gets happy to see black people having success in things that they do. Issa Rae, for instance, excites me every time I see her doing something because I genuinely remember waiting for the next episode of \u201cAwkward Black Girl\u201d on YouTube and being like, this is so good. This chick is so funny, this show is so great, the fact that they\u2019re doing it on their own. So to see her go from that to having this incredible show on HBO, to be on every red carpet, to being in films and winning awards, is just like ...\n\nThat type of stuff when I see that happen to black men, black women across the spectrum, it makes me happy if you deserve it \u2019cause a win for them in many cases is a win for all of us.\n\nI\u2019m just happy, as she says, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d I\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\n\nI\u2019m glad you mentioned that because Issa Rae, Lena Waithe, Donald Glover, they\u2019re all in this class of people who started to produce this content on YouTube and are now just poppin\u2019 and thrivin\u2019, and now you can really say that you\u2019re part of that class as well.\n\nI\u2019m not there yet, girl.\n\nBut almost, almost. The fact that you\u2019re working on this show with Lena is amazing!\n\nI can\u2019t even believe that. Yeah.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about how that happened? And what we can expect?\n\nWell, I believe in God, so I would say that. I\u2019ve been living in New York for over six years, and it was a really rough transition coming from Miami. So, for much of the time that I had been here, I just had this vision in my head of a sitcom surrounding this black gay kid, myself, adjusting not only to a completely new surrounding, but what it\u2019s like trying to figure out how to be an adult in your mid-20s and dealing with depression at the same time, and dealing with the community that we live in.\n\nBeing black and gay, I want people to understand that being black and gay is so different than just being gay. Just in the way that being, this is different, but just the same way of being a black woman is completely different than simply being a woman, and you can ask almost any black woman who\u2019s been to any march for gender equality or anything. Black women get overlooked in the fight for women all of the time, so there\u2019s I think a similar thing that happens in the gay community with black gays.\n\nSo, living in this city, there was way more to do for young gay people, but it\u2019s still a weird adjustment. A lot of it was just really weird for me, and it felt very, very sitcom-y. And so I just had this vision of making this web series about my life and moving here, and what all of that stuff was like. And I was procrastinating on it for a long time on actually getting cameras and all of that stuff, and putting in the work, and eventually I met a woman by the name of Chloe Pisello at Avalon, and she asked me about stuff I was working on, ideas, and I told her about it, and she loved the idea.\n\nWe went around to some networks including HBO, and we ended up working with HBO, signing a deal with HBO to produce this show, and phenomenally Lena Waithe had known who I was. Which already blew my mind because I had been a fan of hers already. And anybody who pays attention to Lena Waithe knows she has ... she should be Jamaican because she has every job. She has every single job. She\u2019s the absolutely baddest, and the industry is lucky to have her.\n\nSomehow, some way, she found herself in some of the offices at HBO and was so nice about me when, I guess, my project came up in conversation, and essentially I was told she told them they would be crazy if they didn\u2019t do it. And from there she ended up on the show as EP, and that excited me because it\u2019s Lena Waithe, and she\u2019s so supportive, and protective, and inspiring and awesome.\n\nI\u2019m really excited about the prospect of this show because I think it will be very, very unique. I think it will be very, very necessary. Again, I haven\u2019t seen a show since \u201cNoah\u2019s Arc\u201d that has been black gay male central. And so I\u2019m just really excited to be able to tell different stories, not just about being black and gay and trying to date, but being human and dealing with the same shit that many other characters deal with in some of your favorite shows, but what it\u2019s like for someone like myself. And I think that it\u2019s gonna be fun, and I can\u2019t wait to get to the next stage of it and share it with people, and it\u2019s a thing that really just sort of fell into place, weirdly enough.\n\nSo that\u2019s why I said I believe that it was meant to happen, and I\u2019m really excited and terrified in a good way about it. Hopefully, there will be a lot more to say about it soon.\n\nPhoto shoot produced by Christy Havranek. Audio production by Nick Offenberg and Sara Patterson.

The sudden reveal reportedly came as a shock to her political team, sending it rushing to firm up her campaign\u2019s infrastructure, including its website and publicity.\n\nIn her discussion with Jones, Gabbard pointed to \u201cthe issue of war and peace\u201d as a primary motivation behind her decision to run.\n\nHuffPost reported last week that the lawmaker took more than $100,000 in campaign donations from arms dealers including BAE Systems, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon from 2012 to 2016, based on data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Gabbard said she had stopped accepting defense industry money.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-democrats-congress_us_5c5a04e2e4b087104758714e": "Andrew Harnik/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is expected to release a resolution outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal as early as this week.\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) are expected to release this week includes language about spurring similar efforts abroad, setting the stage for a debate on how climate change fits into Democrats\u2019 foreign policy visions.\n\nThe resolution calls for the United States to \u201cpromote the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services with the aim to reclaim U.S. leadership on climate change to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal,\u201d multiple sources who have seen the document confirmed to HuffPost.\n\nThe line isn\u2019t completely new. During the fight to establish a select committee on the Green New Deal in the U.S. House late last year, proponents of the policy drafted an 11-page document outlining goals that included making the United States \u201cthe undisputed international leader in \u2026 bringing about a global Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nBut its inclusion in the first formal effort to push a Green New Deal through Congress could spark fresh debate over how central climate change should be to a progressive foreign policy program as more Democrats declare their candidacy for president in 2020. It offers Democrats a counter-argument to President Donald Trump\u2019s stance that global efforts to deal with climate change disadvantage the United States, and it takes account of how domestic changes as sweeping as what\u2019s proposed under a Green New Deal will affect other countries.\n\n\u201cIf you look at historical precedents like the Marshall Plan, it\u2019s really exciting to start thinking about how climate can be centered in a more progressive vision of foreign policy,\u201d Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst at 350.org, said by phone. \u201cThinking of a Green New Deal, not just as strictly domestic policy but as a pillar of American foreign policy, becomes a really evocative ... idea.\u201d\n\nCorbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Markey did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A woman carries building materials at a construction site in the morning smog near New Delhi, India.\n\nForeign policy remains one of the big, unanswered questions about how a serious effort to decarbonize the world\u2019s largest economy would look. Despite his historic efforts to forge the Paris Agreement in 2015, President Barack Obama pledged only $3 billion to a United Nations fund to help poor countries, those whose energy development could determine how bad climate change gets, build cleaner energy infrastructure. When Trump announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017, he canceled payments on the outstanding $2 billion. Some say the unabated push for new coal-fired plants in countries such as Vietnam, for example, reflects the absence of American soft power pushing for cleaner alternatives.\n\nBut there are even bigger implications to decarbonization. Oil- and gas-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia command outsize influence on the world stage in large part due to their control over the global supply of fossil fuels. Entire economies, such as that of Equatorial Guinea, are built around oil fields controlled by U.S.-based giants. And just a handful of small countries are on track to meet the already-lackluster emission reduction goals agreed to in the Paris accords.\n\n\u201cIf you are thinking about a battle of geopolitical dominance between Russia and China and the United States, you need to understand how these energy tools play into our ability to maintain influence,\u201d said Greg Carlock, who authored the think tank Data for Progress\u2019s blueprint for a Green New Deal back in September.\n\nThe progressive wing of the Democratic Party has long struggled to articulate a clear foreign policy vision, much less one that incorporates climate change as an issue. The topics were largely absent from the 2016 presidential primary, during which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) forced a leftward thrust on a slate of domestic policy issues.\n\nIf you look at historical precedents like the Marshall Plan, it\u2019s really exciting to start thinking about how climate can be centered in a more progressive vision of foreign policy. Julian Brave NoiseCat, 350.org\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sexy stuff,\u201d RL Miller, president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said of climate-focused foreign policy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t excite activists. But it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nBut in recent months, Sanders, who is widely expected to once again declare his candidacy for the White House, has begun \u201cquietly remaking the Democrats\u2019 foreign policy,\u201d as Politico reported in October. In November, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who ended last year announcing an exploratory committee for a presidential run, laid out a foreign policy vision tied to her own anti-corruption efforts. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s opposition to U.S. intervention in other countries is expected to take center stage as the Hawaii Democrat\u2019s presidential campaign, launched officially last week, begins in earnest.\n\nThere\u2019s a handful of think tanks emerging that focus specifically on a leftist vision of foreign policy, including the Democracy in Europe 2025 and the Progressive International, a group formed by Sanders allies and Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis. Last month, Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary-general of the United Nations, endorsed Democrats\u2019 push for a Green New Deal, calling it \u201ca very, very good initiative.\u201d\n\nBut the resolution due out this week could offer progressive and even some mainstream Democrats a North Star as they navigate complicated questions of climate change and foreign policy going into the next election.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-president-run-2020_us_5c3fd648e4b0a8dbe16d7add": "Democratic Sen.

(Booker at first said it was because the legislation didn\u2019t address consumer protections for imported drugs \u2015 a month later he backed a similar bill after activists called him out, saying he had been able to add robust safety provisions to the measure.)\n\nProgressives have also criticized the senator for having ties to Wall Street. He received about $2 million from the securities and investment industry for his 2014 Senate campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

But before Brown did that, he promoted a series of proposals designed to make the program more generous and comprehensive.

The next step is to do more.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s posture has already provoked criticism from progressives. If he proceeds with a presidential campaign, he can expect a lot more of it \u2015 as can any other Democratic candidates whose commitment to \u201cMedicare for all\u201d seems suspect.\n\nJust ask Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is running for president. After reaffirming on CNN last week that she supports \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d aides made clear (as they did previously) that she remained open to incremental steps or alternative methods of achieving universal coverage. Social media erupted with accusations from activists that she was watering down her position. So far, the only person who seems immune is Sanders, who may join the 2020 race.\n\nNone of this should be surprising. Presidential campaigns are all about making distinctions among candidates, and there are real differences between somebody like Brown, who doesn\u2019t want to push \u201cMedicare for all\u201d right now, and somebody like Sanders, who does. But the question for Democratic voters over the next year and a half, as they choose their 2020 presidential candidate, is exactly what those differences reveal and, ultimately, which ones matter.\n\nThe Debate Over \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 Is Real Now\n\nOne thing that shouldn\u2019t be in doubt is that nearly all the major Democratic 2020 candidates believe in universal health care coverage, which has been a core party value since President Harry Truman tried to create a national health program in the late 1940s.\n\nTruman had in mind a government-run system that would cover everybody. When his effort crumbled in the face of lobbying by the American Medical Association and other health care industry groups, Democrats began a decades-long effort to get to universal coverage by some other method \u2015 whether it was providing government-run insurance to just part of the population, as Medicare does, or preserving a large role for private insurance, as the ACA does.\n\nThe tilt toward private insurance coincided with a time when the Democratic Party as a whole had a more conservative orientation and its policy advisers had more faith in private enterprise and the forces of competition. Now interest in government-run insurance appears to be surging, partly because so many people still face high medical bills even with the ACA in place and partly because managing Obamacare\u2019s complex markets has proved difficult, with Republicans constantly trying to undermine them.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has said she favors \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But she has also said she's open to other forms of universal coverage and would support incremental reforms on the way to universal health care coverage.\n\nThe 2017 Sanders proposal, which has become the de facto standard for progressives, would address these problems by creating a government-run plan that automatically enrolls everybody, covers every medically necessary service and asks beneficiaries to pay nothing out of their pockets when they visit the doctor or get a lab test. With taxes likely replacing premiums (the Sanders bill doesn\u2019t fully specify financing) and the government setting prices for every kind of medical supply and treatment, the goal would be to reduce overall health care spending and leave most individuals better off.\n\nThe Sanders proposal would more or less eliminate private insurance because it would prohibit employers and private carriers from providing duplicative coverage. Promoters of the idea call this a feature, not a bug, because most people hate dealing with insurance companies anyway. They note, also, that the universal coverage schemes of most countries dramatically minimize or eliminate the role of for-profit insurers.\n\nStill, proponents of the Sanders bill frequently gloss over the variety of universal coverage schemes overseas \u2015 and the ways in which those systems differ from what his version of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would mean here. Wealthier Germans, for example, can opt out of the government system and enroll in private plans, which for-profit insurers sell. Most of the French buy supplemental policies to cover their out-of-pocket costs, which include extra fees that some doctors are allowed to charge.\n\nMore important, perhaps, the national health insurance systems of nearly all those countries date back to the middle of the 20th century, when policymakers looking to enact reforms didn\u2019t have to deal with a private health care financing system as entrenched \u2015 and as expensive \u2015 as the what the U.S. has now.\n\nTrying to pass the Sanders proposal today would mean picking a fight not just with insurers but also with doctors and hospitals, drug and device makers, all of which have been known to protest even relatively moderate threats to their incomes.\n\nThese industries would run ads hammering away at the proposed program\u2019s political vulnerabilities, of which there are many. Surveys have shown consistently that most Americans with private insurance like it, despite the hassles, and that support for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d drops precipitously when respondents hear it would mean having to give up the plans they have.\n\n\u2018Medicare For All\u2019 Isn\u2019t The Only Path To Universal Coverage\n\nPublic opinion isn\u2019t always clear, let alone fixed, so it\u2019s impossible now to know how a debate over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d will play out once both sides make their most compelling arguments. Survey questions referring to upsides of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d push approval higher, just as questions that talk about would-be downsides push it lower.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to see how a politician who believes in universal health care might look at those poll numbers \u2015 and think about the long, frustrating history of comprehensive health care reform \u2015 and opt for changes less sweeping than what Sanders has in mind.\n\nOne option would be a proposal to create a government program that was open to all while giving employers the option to maintain their benefits and giving employees the option of staying with those. Such a plan would be closer to \u201cMedicare for anybody\u201d than \u201cMedicare for everybody,\u201d which is what the Sanders plan envisions. Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) recently introduced such legislation, which mirrors a proposal that the liberal think tank Center for American Progress released last year.\n\nEach of these plans would be subject to substantive and strategic questions, just as the Sanders proposal is. Would the narrower proposals do enough to reduce prices throughout the health care system, so that people who already have insurance would see clear benefits? Would they generate enough enthusiasm from the public to overcome the resistance that even small-bore health care initiatives inevitably raise? And even if only more limited initiatives can pass in the near future, why start compromising on ideas now?", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-trump-socialism_us_5c5a6288e4b087104758a831": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Rep.

That meant Democrats and Republicans could get back to disagreeing about basically everything \u2014 beginning with the litany of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms in the Democrats\u2019 first major bill of 2019.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee held an initial hearing on H.R. 1, the For The People Act. Tuesday\u2019s hearing focused largely on the bill\u2019s voting rights provisions, which fall under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction. These measures aim to expand automatic voter registration, early voting and felon re-enfranchisement. The bill also endorses a restoration of the Voting Rights Act pre-clearance provisions that were gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n\nThe hearing essentially encapsulated the modern fight to vote in America. Democratic lawmakers, pointing to numerous recent examples of long lines at the polls, voter purging and excessive gerrymandering, described a system that is shutting out too many Americans and needs reform. Republican lawmakers, aided by their witnesses, suggested claims of suppression were exaggerated and accused Democrats of wanting to change voting laws for their own political benefit.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, presided over the first hearings for H.R. 1, a package of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms.\n\n\u201cGeorgia has three and a half weeks of early voting. We discussed the long lines that actually should be applauded. We have long lines because a lot of people wanted to vote,\u201d said Rep Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocrats invited Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Sarah Turberville, director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, and Adav Noti, director of trial litigation at the Campaign Legal Center, to testify on the need to expand voting rights and enact other provisions of the bill. Republicans invited Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation and J. Christian Adams of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, two individuals known for exaggerating the threat of in-person voter fraud.\n\nThe decision to invite Adams and von Spakovsky as their sole witnesses was an early indicator that Republicans were prepared to oppose this legislation with discredited, bad faith arguments. By the end of the hearing, GOP lawmakers had derided the bill as an unconstitutional power grab by a corrupt Democratic Party that steals elections and loves child rapists.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have a long history of stealing elections,\u201d Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said as he declared the bill was another attempt to do just that.\n\nBuck\u2019s historical examples ranged from New York party boss William \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed in the 1880s to Louisiana Gov. Huey Long of the 1930s to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley of the 1960s. The only contemporary examples Buck presented were the false racial panic whipped up by Fox News and the conservative media ecosystem over the idea that the New Black Panther Party had helped President Barack Obama win the 2008 election and a unsubstantiated claim that Hillary Clinton stole the 2016 presidential nomination from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Neither Buck nor any other Republican at the hearing acknowledged an ongoing investigation in North Carolina into suspected election fraud conducted on behalf of a Republican.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) claimed that Democrats want ex-felons to regain the right to vote merely to build power for their party. But in Florida, a constitutional amendment easing the path for felons who\u2019ve done their time to get their voting rights back garnered bipartisan support and passed overwhelmingly in November. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, recently called to lift her state\u2019s lifetime ban on felons voting.\n\nCollins argued that the bill could be called the \u201cFor The Violent Criminals Act\u201d because it provided ex-felons with a right to vote. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) attacked the legislation for seeking to restore voting rights to all former felons. He read from a list of criminals who violated election laws or raped children and asked why they should be allowed to vote.\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Ken Buck claimed the bill was just another example of Democrats trying to steal elections \u2015 like Boss Tweed or Huey Long or some other corrupt politician from another century.\n\nVon Spakovsky and Adams said H.R. 1 was a mishmash of unconstitutional provisions and \u201cbad policy.\u201d But it was their own histories of inflating concerns about voter fraud that came into focus during the hearing.\n\nBoth von Spakovsky and Adams were members of Trump\u2019s failed voter fraud commission, which was created to justify the president\u2019s false claims that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election. They have both also made repeated false and unsubstantiated claims about in-person voter fraud in order to support strict voter identification laws and other restrictions on voter registration and access.\n\nWitnesses called to testify in support of the legislation ended up rebuking von Spakovsky and Adams for their claims.\n\nIfill said that von Spakovsky was providing misleading testimony in his defense of controversial voter ID laws when he pointed to each law\u2019s \u201creasonable impediment\u201d provision, which lets voters cast ballots without identification if they demonstrate some difficulty in obtaining it.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of testimony that I find the most disturbing because it is so misleading,\u201d Ifill said. \u201cTo the extent that these voter ID laws now include this reasonable exception, it is because we had to litigate it over years. And the settlement of those cases came after years and years of elections in which voters were disenfranchised and unable to participate in the political process.\u201d\n\nGupta pointed to a 2018 opinion from a federal judge, a George W.

In a \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired on Jan. 27, he said he is considering a run for the presidency in 2020 as an independent.\n\nWe do not know if a third-party presidential run by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz would throw the 2020 election for President Donald Trump. Professional Democrats, of course, are terrified by this prospect.\n\nBut the fact that Schultz can imagine running for president only as a long-shot third-party candidate demonstrates something critical \u2014 and frequently overlooked \u2014 about his brand of politics. Schultz hails from an aging, elite enclave in which the conventional wisdom of the 1990s remains the foundation of all political truth. It is a world where balanced budgets, low taxes and government spending cuts animate the top minds among Republicans and Democrats alike. But in the 21st century, the 1990s are a political death sentence.\n\nIn a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired on Sunday, Schultz reeled off a list of complaints about contemporary politics cryogenically preserved from 1995. \u201cWhat the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford.\u201d The bean-counting billionaire said he would not have cut corporate taxes as much as Trump did but refuses to say whether he would raise corporate taxes as president.\n\n\u201cI look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cWe are sitting today with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example \u2015 not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well \u2015 as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.\u201d\n\nSchultz is distressed that the current administration locks children in cages and leaves them to die, but he finds the prospect of Democrats authorizing spending on health care comparably troubling. Back in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Schultz would have been toasted as a great mind for making such pronouncements. Everyone, it seemed \u2015 Clinton, then\u2013Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, then\u2013House Speaker Newt Gingrich \u2014 agreed: Low budget deficits would boost Wall Street\u2019s confidence in America\u2019s fiscal sustainability, bringing down interest rates and boosting economic growth. Since the government was too clunky and inefficient to spend money wisely, according to this orthodoxy, it was best to get deficits down through spending cuts, rather than tax increases, although a slight hike for the richest households could be stomached for the sake of appearances. It was very nice that bleeding-heart liberals wanted to spend money to alleviate poverty and treat the sick, but ultimately, most people would be better off with smaller deficits.\n\nThe problem with this story is that it isn\u2019t true. Despite endless prophecies of debt apocalypse during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama years, fiscal armageddon has steadfastly refused to arrive. \u201cEconomists increasingly recognize the benefits of budget deficits,\u201d noted Stephanie Kelton, an economics professor at Stony Brook University. \u201cDeficits are an important policy tool, especially at a time when global growth is slowing.\u201d\n\nSchultz hails from an aging, elite enclave in which the conventional wisdom of the 1990s remains the foundation of all political truth.\n\nIn fact, economists have been distancing themselves from these 1990s relics for quite some time. \u201cThe tide of expert opinion is shifting the other way from this \u2018Old View,\u2019 to almost the opposite view,\u201d wrote Jason Furman in 2016. Furman, a thoroughly conventional economist in the Clinton administration, was also a thoroughly conventional economist in the Obama administration. By the end of Obama\u2019s presidency, the conventional wisdom had changed.\n\nIf his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview is any indication, Schultz isn\u2019t very good with numbers. His $21.5 trillion debt monster is an exaggeration: It includes trillions of dollars the government owes to itself. As of the third quarter of 2018, the total debt held by the public was about $15.8 trillion. And he is simply wrong about the affordability of \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Even the Mercatus Center, a think tank funded by Charles and David Koch, found that Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care plan would actually lower total health care costs.\n\nBut the fundamental problem for Schultz isn\u2019t his ineptitude with calculators. It\u2019s the way ordinary Americans think about politics in the 21st century. Polling consistently indicates that a majority of Republicans support \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Among Democrats, support hovers around 80 percent. Few political ideas are so popular. As he vacillates on tax hikes for the rich, 59 percent of voters surveyed said they favor increasing the marginal tax rate on the highest-income Americans to 70 percent \u2014 including 60 percent of independent voters, 57 percent of Southern voters and 56 percent of rural voters.\n\nIf there were a large constituency for what he is offering, his easiest path to the White House would run through a major political party.

Billionaires.\n\nTheir very existence is now the subject of political debate, sparked most recently by tax-the-rich proposals from two prominent politicians.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed placing a 2 percent tax on wealth over $50 million and 3 percent on assets over $1 billion. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said she wants to increase the marginal tax rate on those earning more than $10 million a year.\n\nTheir ideas went viral, starting a mainstream conversation about inequality and wealth.\n\nThis kind of talk has always existed among a certain group of hard-core progressives and left-leaning economists, but heading into next year\u2019s presidential election, the idea that the super-rich should pay their fair share is gaining real momentum.\n\nMarshall Steinbaum, a research director at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute, has advocated taxing the rich at higher rates for years. \u201cWe do not need billionaires,\u201d Steinbaum told HuffPost. \u201cThe economy\u2019s done better without billionaires in the past.\u201d\n\nFor Steinbaum, higher taxes on the wealthy would mean freeing up more money for everyone else. If you think of the economy as a pie, right now, billionaires are getting just about all of it, while we\u2019re all left splitting just one slice.\n\nIf you raise taxes on the richest, their incentive to grab at every morsel declines. The theory is they\u2019ll fight a little less hard to depress everyone else\u2019s wages if they know that every extra million is going to get taxed away. A high-paid CEO has less incentive to keep workers\u2019 wages low so he can get a bigger payday.\n\nBillionaires were once a rare breed. In the past few decades, as the U.S. has slashed tax rates, their numbers have exploded, far outpacing inflation.\n\nSince 2008, the number of billionaires in the world has doubled, according to a report published last week by the anti-poverty nonprofit Oxfam. In just the last year, billionaires raked in an astonishing $2.5 billion each day.\n\nIn 1982, the first year Forbes debuted its list of the 400 richest Americans, there were about a dozen billionaires. The richest man in the U.S. back then was an 85-year-old shipping magnate with an estimated worth of $2 billion, or $5.2 billion in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nWe do not need billionaires. The economy\u2019s done better without billionaires in the past. Marshall Steinbaum, Roosevelt Institute\n\nNowadays, Forbes\u2019 list is entirely billionaires. The richest is Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $160 billion.\n\nOf course, rich people are, with a few exceptions, freaking out over the idea that their taxes might go up. The Wall Street Journal editorial page is in full panic mode and Rush Limbaugh is trotting out the Hitler comparisons.\n\nBillionaire presidential hopeful Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO, is so panicked about higher taxes on the rich that he decided to abandon the Democratic Party and run as an independent, he said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nSchultz clocks in at No. 280 on Forbes\u2019 list with a net worth of $3.4 billion. He grew up in a public housing development. The fact that one of the nation\u2019s most successful men started out living in government-supported housing is but a tiny example of how taxes can help those at the bottom rise to the top. Without that kind of support, many successful Americans would be toiling away, minus their fortunes.\n\nThere is a raft of policies in place that help America crank out billionaires: lax antitrust laws and regulations; strong intellectual property protections; low tax rates; government-funded research. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates (No. 2 on Forbes\u2019 list in 2018) couldn\u2019t have amassed a fortune, for example, without strict copyright and patent protections on his software, Steinbaum pointed out.\n\nThe late Steve Jobs, widely regarded as an absolute genius who deserved every last dollar, used a boatload of government-funded technology to help create his defining device, the iPhone. Google also benefited from government-funded research, argues Mariana Mazzucato in a piece in the Harvard Business Review.\n\n\u201cOver the years. U.S. taxpayers have been very good to Apple,\u201d she writes, adding that in return, the Cupertino, California, computer maker and other tech companies have done everything they can to get out of paying taxes and paying it forward.\n\nMost entrepreneurs like to argue that they\u2019ve achieved great wealth in spite of the government, not with its help.\n\nThere are exceptions. Warren Buffet famously wrote about his light tax burden, as compared to his secretary, for example.\n\nChris Sacca, a retired venture capitalist estimated to be worth about $1 billion and known for his early investments in Twitter and Uber, tweeted his tentative support for Warren\u2019s wealth tax last week. \u201cVery lucky guy here (who got rich in part thanks to public schools, access to health care, etc.), weighing in to say that @ewarren\u2019s proposal to put a 2-3% annual tax on wealth over $50 million is *extremely* and *radically*... reasonable.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by HuffPost to elaborate, Sacca was careful not to embrace Warren\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans are working their asses off yet struggling to make ends meet. The social safety net is slipping away, and with it, many people\u2019s shot at the American dream,\u201d Sacca said. \u201cSenator Warren\u2019s proposal would be hard to define and implement, and there are intriguing alternatives. I\u2019m not endorsing her specific approach as much as I am the need for all of us to talk about this stuff. We all need to have a reasonable and productive conversation about the best ways the privilege of some can ensure life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all.\u201d\n\nSchultz, meanwhile, has called criticism of a system that creates billionaires \u201cso un-American.\u201d\n\nNo one makes a billion dollars.

The ethos that the rich should only get so rich was baked into our tax code beginning in the 20th century. Indeed, from 1936-1980, the top tax rate never dipped below 70 percent.\n\nThe idea that paying taxes was a civic good started to sour in the 1980s during the Reagan years, but it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that billionaires got a rethink.\n\nThank the tech boom. In the 1990s, tech billionaires became fetish objects. Khaki-wearing \u201cgeniuses\u201d like Gates were worshipped in places like Fast Company magazine.\n\n\u201cThe \u201990s were a time when people were cheering for billionaires, and I thought that was such a strange thing to do,\u201d said Thomas Frank, a political analyst, historian and author of Pity the Billionaire.\n\n\u201cHaving billionaires became an end in itself,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIt was so obviously wrongheaded.\u201d\n\nRich tech bros even got a pass in the wake of the Great Recession when bankers became reviled. It\u2019s hard to remember now, but once upon a time, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was thought to be a wunderkind, here to change the world.\n\nTimes changed.\n\n\u201cShould we even have billionaires?\u201d is the defining question of 2019, said Anand Giridharadas, the author of Winners Take All, a scathing critique of the plutocrat class\u2019s largely empty efforts to \u201cchange the world\u201d published last year.\n\n\u201cNo one makes a billion dollars.

In 2011, he asked business leaders around the country to \u201cforgo political contributions\u201d until Washington \u201cdeliver[ed] a fiscally disciplined long-term debt and deficit plan to the American people.\u201d Last year, he called the national debt the \u201cgreatest threat domestically to this country.\u201d\n\nThat concern may explain Schultz\u2019s comments on health care \u2015 that Democrats believe in \u201cfree health care for all\u201d and that \u201cthe country cannot afford it.\u201d Presumably he is thinking of proposals to create a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system in which a new government insurance program would cover everybody, with no premiums or out-of-pocket costs. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed such a plan, and many Democrats have endorsed it.\n\nBut not all Democrats support the Sanders plan, and whether the plan would actually lead to higher spending would depend on a number of variables, like how successful it was at holding down payments to doctors and hospitals. (A proposal like Sanders\u2019 could actually result in less overall spending.) And while the federal government would end up spending more \u2015 because it would be taking over spending from employers and private individuals \u2015 federal debt would rise only if the government didn\u2019t offset that spending with new taxes, such as on the very rich, or with cuts elsewhere.\n\nDuring the interview, Schultz aligned himself with many Democrats in other ways. He said he believed there should be \u201ca fair and equitable way\u201d for undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens, that leaving the Paris climate accord was a \u201ctremendous mistake,\u201d and that the Republican tax bill went too far.\n\nSchultz stepped away from Starbucks last summer after more than three decades with the company, saying he had become \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about \u201cgrowing division\u201d in the U.S. and wanted to figure out what he could do to help his country.\n\nThe possibility that Schultz may run as an independent candidate has already rankled Democrats. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro, who has announced he plans to run for president as a Democrat, said Schultz running \u201cwould provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting re-elected.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was worried his own presidential run could help Trump win another four years in the White House, Schultz made it clear he didn\u2019t buy that line of thinking.\n\n\u201cI want to see the American people win. I want to see America win. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas.

Scholten has a new mission -- getting his party's leader to pay more attention to the challenges facing rural areas like his.\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2015 J.D. Scholten, a lanky Democrat from northwest Iowa, is frustrated \u2015 albeit in a polite, Midwestern kind of way.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t he be? In November, the 38-year-old former paralegal and minor-league pitcher fought white supremacist Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) to within inches of the incumbent\u2019s political life.\n\nScholten, who drove his RV, \u201cSioux City Sue,\u201d to all 39 counties that comprise Iowa\u2019s vast, rural 4th U.S. House seat, came within 3 percentage points of winning in a district Donald Trump won by 27 points two years earlier and where King was used to cruising to victory.\n\nJust two months later, King\u2019s career is on the ropes following recent comments to The New York Times questioning why the terms \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d or \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d are \u201coffensive.\u201d House Republicans, who previously ignored King\u2019s racism and relentless bashing of undocumented immigrants, have stripped him of his committee assignments. And state Sen. Randy Feenstra has already declared his intention to challenge King in the 2020 GOP primary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appreciative of the Republicans who are stepping up and saying this is unacceptable, but on the flip side I\u2019m extremely frustrated because [King] said the same damn thing in October,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost in an interview in Sioux City on Saturday.\n\nHuffPost caught up with Scholten over coffee just hours before he was due to host Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) during her inaugural presidential campaign swing. He discussed the \u201copportunism\u201d of King\u2019s new GOP critics, his future plans and why he thinks Democrats need to pay greater attention to the economic struggles of rural communities.\n\nBelow is a lightly edited and condensed transcript of our conversation.\n\nWhat was your reaction King\u2019s latest comments?\n\nHe said something similar on television in Des Moines [in October]. I didn\u2019t know what to think of it. Like everything with him. You\u2019re like, \u201cOh that\u2019s awful. But will it get picked up or not?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between this and past things? To call a spade a spade, I think it\u2019s that I got within three points and he\u2019s vulnerable. If he wins by 20, is this the story? Would Republicans rebuke him?\n\nI\u2019m appreciative of the Republicans who are stepping up and saying this is unacceptable, but on the flip side, I\u2019m extremely frustrated because he said the same damn thing in October.\n\nAnd here in Iowa, you had Gov. [Kim] Reynolds still as his co-chair, you had [Sen. Chuck] Grassley do an endorsement of him the night before the election, and you had [Sen. Joni] Ernst campaign with him the night before the election. For them to all of a sudden be high and holy on this is a little opportunistic.\n\nShould King\u2019s congressional colleagues expel him?\n\nI\u2019m not calling for his resignation, because he got voted in. We\u2019re stuck with him. I\u2019m not calling for his expulsion. I\u2019m not calling for a lot of things.\n\nI respect democracy \u2015 and he won. It sucks, but he won. And I\u2019ve accepted that.\n\nI\u2019m at the point that if I don\u2019t recognize the number [on my phone], it\u2019s more likely to be a presidential candidate than it is a telemarketer. J.D. Scholten\n\nDo you have plans to run again in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District or challenge Sen. Joni Ernst in 2020?\n\nI\u2019m waiting to see what happens with King. I\u2019m trying to get my legs underneath my life personally. And regarding the Senate seat, I\u2019m considering it. I\u2019m not closing any doors at this time. I\u2019m just kinda waiting to see.\n\nYour district, ironically, thrives on immigrants. What\u2019s your message to 2020 candidates about the immigration message that plays here?\n\nWe need a workforce. It goes with rural advocacy.\n\nA rural Iowan life is getting harder and harder to live in a lot of different ways \u2015 whether it\u2019s [due to] school consolidation, or rising health care costs and shrinking accessibility. In a lot of towns, their grocery store is a Dollar General. They don\u2019t have fresh produce and yet we\u2019re in the heart of the second-most agriculture-producing district in America. That\u2019s a little bizarre.\n\nWe have millionaire farmers and we have farmers struggling to survive and that middle farmer isn\u2019t there any more. It\u2019s representative of what\u2019s happening in America where we haven\u2019t found an answer to globalization as it affects the working class.\n\nMy message to 2020 [presidential contenders] is to understand the difficulties of what it\u2019s like to be in rural America and to have a message that includes [its residents]. We\u2019re becoming the Whole Foods party and that\u2019s been well documented \u2015 very urban and very suburban \u2015 but it\u2019s places like this, the Dollar General districts, that are going dictate the Electoral College, dictate Senate races. And if we want to be a sustainable party, we need to produce better in districts like this.\n\nScott Morgan / Reuters Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) talks to voters in Webster City, Iowa, shortly before he barely beat Scholten in November's election, winning a ninth term.\n\nHas your run been a net-win for the district, because you have presidential candidates reaching out to you and it\u2019s an opportunity for you to talk about championing the \u201cDollar General districts\u201d through things like antitrust policy?\n\nFor years, I haven\u2019t answered an unknown phone number. In the last month of the campaign, that changed. And now I\u2019m at the point that if I don\u2019t recognize the number, it\u2019s more likely to be a presidential candidate than it is a telemarketer. That\u2019s how surreal my life is right now.\n\nI don\u2019t have votes in Congress, but if you compare me side by side with what I\u2019m trying to do for the district and what King is doing, I think it\u2019s pretty damn comparable.\n\nBehind the scenes, I\u2019m working on opportunity zones that we can bring into this district. I\u2019ve sat down with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). He was instrumental in bringing $70,000 technology jobs to Jefferson, Iowa, which is going to change that county for the better.\n\nThe Democratic Party talks about raising the minimum wage. That\u2019s fine. But in this district, we need those $55,000, $65,000, $75,000 jobs. That\u2019s what\u2019s important. Because we have an economy in the 4th district that can\u2019t absorb our kids.\n\nYou look at Iowa State \u2015 they graduated 1,400 students in technology in 2017. In 2018, only 258 are still in Iowa. That\u2019s 18 percent. That\u2019s what I\u2019m passionate about: bringing technology here.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m taking to the 2020 folks: rural revitalization. I called it the new rural economy. And it\u2019s three things: traditional agriculture; advanced manufacturing and having the workforce to prepare for that; and technology.\n\nThe only label I\u2019m comfortable calling myself is a populist. J.D. Scholten\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of attention on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal idea. The New York Democrat has started a conversation about bolder climate change action and how it could be tied to economic revitalization. Do you see that applying in your district?\n\nWe\u2019ve been the leader in wind energy in America. Look at the irony of Steve King in a district that leads the nation in wind energy. He hasn\u2019t done a damn thing for it.\n\nThe farmers know about weather. They\u2019re experts on the weather. And it\u2019s becoming so difficult for them to plan. We had huge rains in the spring and in the fall, when they plant and when they harvest, and then a very dry summer. That\u2019s the opposite of what it had been and so they\u2019re gonna have to adapt to these things. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m passionate about climate change.\n\nAnd the other part of it is, we have opportunities to help sequester carbon in what I call \u201ccarbon farming.\u201d We could be at the forefront of that and that could help farmers with their profits.\n\nI don\u2019t hear a lot from you about hot-button cultural issues, including much talk about President Trump. Why is that?\n\nA large part of my race was not trying to make it a national race. We\u2019re going to have the [cultural conversation] for years and people have strong views on both sides of that.\n\nBut to the majority of people who are here and throughout the district, I\u2019m talking about tangible things that affect their lives.\n\nMy two personal heroes were [former Sen.] Tom Harkin and [former Rep.] Berkeley Bedell. They were Midwest populists. And we just have a lack of Democrats in the Midwest who are like that any more.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a lack of Democrats period.\n\nWhen I go to these national trainings and there are all these fights about what kind of Democrat you are, I say, \u201cCome to the 4th district where we\u2019re just trying to fight to be Democrats.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Nati Harnik Sen.

The only label I\u2019m comfortable calling myself is a populist \u2015 and a lot of the populist ideas overlap with the progressive.\n\nWhat does \u201cpopulist\u201d mean to you?\n\nIt\u2019s fighting for the everyday person. I look at the area I grew up in. It\u2019s a bunch of working-class folks who are just trying to have a good life for their kids.\n\nYou\u2019re about to meet Sen. Gillibrand. Do you have thoughts on her or any other 2020 presidential candidate?\n\nAs far as the 2020 field, I think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s game. It\u2019s interesting to see who thrives and who takes control of it.\n\nIowans, for the most part, we\u2019re looking for a leader and we\u2019re looking for authenticity. And for the most part we do not get fooled \u2015 with the exception of [former presidential candidate and North Carolina Sen.] John Edwards. He was pretty well liked, especially in these parts.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders campaigned for you. Do you want to see him get in the race again?\n\nI\u2019m excited to see everybody.

They have been demanding guarantees of smaller class sizes and increased support staff.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and district Superintendent Austin Beutner called the agreement \u201chistoric\u201d during a news conference Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cToday marks a new chapter in public education and a new chapter in Los Angeles Unified,\u201d said Beutner.\n\nThe agreement makes key concessions on issues like support staff and class sizes, axing a previous contract provision that allowed the district to ignore class size caps. Classes will be reduced by at least one student starting next school year \u2015 with more reductions in the neediest schools. Reductions will continue over the next several years. In the lead-up to the strike, teachers complained of having over 40 kids in some classrooms.\n\nThe deal guarantees a full-time nurse at every school over time, as well as an increase in librarians and school counselors. Some schools currently have a nurse for only one day a week.\n\n\u201cThis is much more than just a narrow labor agreement, it\u2019s a broad compact,\u201d Caputo-Pearl said at the news conference, noting the agreement also addresses issues of social and racial justice. It includes a dedicated attorney for immigrant families and support for implementation of an ethnic studies curriculum.\n\nTensions around the power of charter schools in the district also played a key role in the strike. An agreement, though not formally in the deal, calls for the state to create a committee on charter schools at the next Board of Education meeting, and vote on a resolution for a charter school cap. At the district level, the deal gives the union more say in the design of co-location sites, where traditional public schools and charter schools share space.\n\nAs part of the deal, teachers will also be receiving a 6 percent salary increase.\n\nWhile Beutner had long said that the district could not afford to pay for the teachers\u2019 demands, UTLA, the mayor\u2019s office and the district are pledging to collaboratively advocate for more county and state funding.\n\nStill, there are \u201ctremendous concerns about insolvency,\u201d Beutner said. California provides some of the lowest levels of per-pupil funding in the nation.\n\nThe two sides had bargained deep Monday night, into Tuesday morning. The talks had only ceased around 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning. Teachers are expected to approve the deal Tuesday. The district board must also approve the agreement.\n\nThe strike impacted almost half a million students. While Los Angeles schools stayed open during the strike \u2015 relying on just a few hundred non-unionized substitute teachers to supervise \u2015 only a fraction of the district\u2019s students attended schools during that time. Last Thursday, attendance reached a low of only around 84,000 students, according to the district. The students who went to school described being corralled into auditoriums and watching movies or given busy work. Parents who decided to keep their kids out of school during the strike also scrambled to find child care.\n\nThe strike came on the heels of a \u201cred state rebellion\u201d which swept states like Kentucky, Arizona and West Virginia last spring and summer. Only this time, teachers were clashing with a Democratic school superintendent, in the heart of the deeply blue state. In the background of the strike were tensions over the future of charter schools in the district \u2015 a cause that has both critics and proponents within the party.\n\n\u201cThis conflict is forcing the issue of school privatization and charter schools in the Democratic Party,\u201d Lois Weiner, an independent researcher and consultant who has studied teachers unions, previously told HuffPost.\n\nNational attention given to the strike helped push a deal forward, said the leaders. Indeed, the strike received attention and support from national Democratic leaders like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nCaputo-Pearl called the strike a pivotal show of force for labor unions and a positive sign for the future of public education.\n\n\u201cThis strike has not only moved this agreement, but raised the issue of public education not only nationally but internationally,\u201d said Caputo-Pearl.\n\nThis article has been updated with the union voting to end the strike.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/venezuela-juan-guaido-donald-trump-2020-democrats_us_5c520bd0e4b04f8645c745f4": "Caitlin Ochs / Reuters Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) approves of recognizing Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim Venezuelan president and supports sanctions, but not military action.\n\nPresident Donald Trump drew rare bipartisan praise for his decision to recognize Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s head of state after the former head of the National Assembly declared himself interim president.\n\nThe U.S. and Venezuela have longstanding tensions over sovereignty, trade and ideology, and the Trump administration has recently ramped up sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil industry, refusing to rule out military action against the country\u2019s left-leaning authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) seemed to speak for the bipartisan foreign policy establishment when he welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to recognize the newcomer, declaring on the Senate floor his support for Guaid\u00f3, who was relatively unknown in Venezuela until about a month ago. The comments reflect the degree to which the Democratic Party remains less willing to question its long-standing support for U.S. intervention in the affairs of foreign governments.\n\nHuffPost reached out to all of the Democratic presidential candidates \u2015 both those officially in the field and those who are expected to announce \u2015 for their positions on U.S. policy toward Venezuela.\n\nWe asked the candidates and would-be candidates for their opinion of Trump\u2019s recognition of Guaid\u00f3, as well as sanctions, military action and other policy options.\n\nNone of the candidates or would-be candidates endorsed national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s insistence that \u201call options are on the table,\u201d and the Democrats who did answer all rejected the possible use of military force to remove Maduro. Trump has advocated for a military invasion of the oil-rich South American country in the past, but Venezuela experts questioned this policy tactic and viewed that scenario as unlikely. However, other observers agreed with Trump\u2019s recognition of Guaid\u00f3.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.): Supports recognizing Guaid\u00f3 and imposing sanctions, but opposes military intervention.\n\nIn a statement, Meredith Kelly, communications director for Gillibrand\u2019s exploratory committee, denounced Maduro\u2019s \u201ccorrupt reign,\u201d declaring that \u201cAmerica must stand with the Venezuelan people in their struggle for human rights and their country.\u201d\n\nThen Kelly laid out Gillibrand\u2019s recommendations, which stop short of military action.\n\n\u201cSenator [Kirsten] Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) supports working with our allies to recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 - who was legitimately elected - as the interim president under the Constitution until Venezuela can hold new elections,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, communications director for Sen. Gillibrand\u2019s presidential exploratory committee. \u201cAnd while she believes economic sanctions are the appropriate response to achieve this, she does not support sending troops to Venezuela.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.): Supports recognizing Guaid\u00f3 and imposing sanctions, but opposes military intervention.\n\n\u201cAfter years of corrupt and failed authoritarian socialist regimes, Venezuela is faced with a humanitarian crisis resulting in millions of displaced refugees and a country in economic ruin,\u201d former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) told HuffPost in an email. \u201cI support the emerging leadership in the country and the United States should provide strong regional leadership in transitioning the new government. The United States should work with our partners in the region to provide significant humanitarian aid that gets to the Venezuelan people.\u201d\n\nDelaney supports sanctions \u201cto increase pressure on Maduro,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe Administration must strike a careful balance of achieving the desired effects with potential ramifications for the Venezuelan people who have already suffered so much.\u201d\n\nBut he opposes any military effort to depose Maduro.\n\n\u201cAbsent protecting American citizens,\u201d Delaney said, \u201cI do not support military intervention in this transition, nor using force to remove Maduro; the Venezuelan people must demand true democracy and decide their own future.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Ariana Cubillos National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3, center, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela. President Donald Trump and some Democrats have agreed to recognize him.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio): Calls for free and fair elections, and denounces \u2018loose talk of possible military intervention.\u2019\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is mulling a presidential run, lambasted the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cloose talk of possible military intervention\u201d as \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nHe stopped short of spelling out his views on recognizing Guaid\u00f3 or sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe should work with our allies and use economic, political and diplomatic leverage to help bring about free and fair elections, limit escalating tension, and ensure the safety of Americans on the ground,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): Opposes sanctions and military intervention.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has announced her plans to run for president, expressed a similar sentiment to Brown, but she condemned an escalation of sanctions as well.\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan people deserve free and fair elections, an economy that works, and the ability to live without fear of violence from their own government,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of reckless threats of military action or sanctions that hurt those in need, we should be taking real steps to support the Venezuelan people.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, Mayor of South Bend: Calls for free and fair elections so \u2018the Venezuelan people can determine their future.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Maduro government has wrecked its claim to international legitimacy and it\u2019s time for free and fair elections, so that the Venezuelan people can determine their future,\u201d Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg told HuffPost in an email. \u201cSanctions are an appropriate tool for dealing with bad actors and in this case they should be targeted and aimed at bringing about new and legitimate elections with international observers and poll protections.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, opposes military intervention, and he questioned Bolton\u2019s role as national security adviser given Bolton\u2019s past in pushing the U.S. into war in Iraq.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to military intervention, one clear lesson of foreign policy in my lifetime is that even if you would like to see regime change, you shouldn\u2019t recklessly send out American troops and put their lives on the line to bring about a new government in a foreign country,\u201d he said. \u201cI remain puzzled that someone who helped lead us into the Iraq war is in a position of great trust and responsibility as the National Security Adviser making recommendations on war and peace.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): Free elections, not \u2018regime change.\u2019\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is expected to announce a bid for the presidency, tweeted his thoughts about the situation on Thursday.\n\nIn a three-tweet thread, Sanders, who has gotten more involved in foreign policy since his 2016 presidential run, at once condemned the authoritarian tactics and economic failures of the Maduro regime and warned against backing \u201cregime change or supporting coups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has a long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American nations; we must not go down that road again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut we must learn the lessons of the past and not be in the business of regime change or supporting coups\u2014as we have in Chile, Guatemala, Brazil & the DR.

We don\u2019t want other countries to choose our leaders\u2015so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign did not elaborate on her stance on the Trump administration\u2019s sanctions against the Maduro government.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.): Maduro is \u2018alarming to me on many levels.\u2019\n\nIn a brief interview on Capitol Hill, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) told HuffPost that Maduro \u201cis alarming to me on many levels\u201d but did not elaborate beyond that. His office did not respond to further requests for comment.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.): I support the Venezuelan people \u2018restoring democracy.\u2019\n\nSen.

He has emphasized his control of the military.\n\nA spokesman for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is reportedly considering a run, declined to comment.\n\nThe campaigns or exploratory committees of Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro did not respond to inquiries about the candidates\u2019 stances on Venezuela.\n\n\u2018We all think the dictator must go.\u2019\n\nMaduro was elected in 2013, after the death of socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who survived a coup attempt that was possibly linked to the Bush administration in 2002. Since he came to power, Maduro has faced internal and international opposition over his authoritarian crackdowns on political dissent, and resistance to his presidency has intensified amid an economic crisis spurred by global declines in oil prices.\n\nMaduro was a subject of debate within the Obama administration, as it weighed whether to sanction the president and top Venezuelan government officials amid allegations of human rights abuses. Obama sanctioned seven Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in 2015, a decision that drew rebukes across Latin America.\n\nThe situation has continued to deteriorate since, and an estimated 3 million refugees and migrants have left the country amid economic turmoil, including spiraling inflation and food and medicine shortages. Maduro won a second term in May 2018, after an election marred by official boycotts from opposition parties and claims that the president had acted to rig the results in his favor. The opposition parties declared the results illegitimate and were joined by the United States, European Union, and several large, influential Latin American democracies.\n\nMaduro has clung to power since Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the legitimate leader on Jan. 23 amid widespread protests both in support of and against the government. Leaning on the support of the armed forces, Maduro opened the door to dialogue with the opposition and Guaid\u00f3 as protests erupted again on Wednesday. But there is no guarantee that the dispute will lead to new elections or come to an immediate resolution, even as the Trump administration has said it will use any means available to remove Maduro from office.\n\nWe cannot control the outcomes [in foreign countries] no matter how much we wish to or thought we could in the 1990s. We have to have more humility about our ability to shape the world in our own image. Daniel Bessner, a University of Washington historian of U.S. foreign policy\n\nWhatever the outcome, Venezuela\u2019s future and what, if any, role the United States should play in it could become a major international relations question in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, which some left-wing foreign policy observers hope will be a testing ground for new ideas much in the way that domestic policies like Medicare for all shook up the 2016 contest.\n\nThe discussion about Venezuela policy is an early indicator of those candidates\u2019 appetite for foreign intervention \u2015 or lack thereof, according to Daniel Bessner, a University of Washington historian of U.S. foreign policy, who has encouraged progressive Democrats to adopt bold foreign policy ideas.\n\n\u201cWhat candidates will say will determine whether they will depart from the assumptions that have guided U.S. foreign policy for a long time,\u201d Bessner said.\n\nBessner said he is skeptical of the American inclination to \u201cdo something\u201d any time major problems arise in a foreign country.\n\n\u201cWe cannot control the outcomes [in foreign countries] no matter how much we wish to or thought we could in the 1990s,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have more humility about our ability to shape the world in our own image.\u201d\n\nLawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who has sometimes broken with Washington\u2019s interventionist consensus, nonetheless supported Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Guaid\u00f3. He does not think the debate over Venezuela reveals fundamental philosophical disagreements among Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of nuanced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all think the dictator must go, the question is what\u2019s the best way to do it.\u201d\n\nIgor Bobic contributed reporting.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) speaks at the Iowa Women's March on Saturday in Des Moines. The speech was part of her first presidential campaign trip.\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2015 When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) walked into Sioux City Gifts on Friday afternoon, the store was virtually empty save for the dozen reporters who had tagged along to document her inaugural presidential campaign swing.\n\nBut after greeting the cashier, Gillibrand spied a lone patron \u2015 visibly stunned to be surrounded by the media entourage \u2015 and immediately introduced herself.\n\nThe customer, Diane Desy, 55, a local retail worker and avid Republican, told Gillibrand she was concerned about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGillibrand asked whether Desy would support comprehensive immigration reform combining, among other things, tougher border security with a pathway to citizenship for those undocumented immigrants already in the country.\n\nDesy responded favorably and the two got to talking about veterans issues. By the time Gillibrand moved on to inspect the store\u2019s photography studio, she had made a dent in Desy\u2019s lifelong allegiance to the GOP.\n\nAlthough the woman said she has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and is relatively satisfied with President Donald Trump, she told reporters she would at least give Gillibrand serious consideration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impressed with her,\u201d Desy said. \u201cI lean more conservative, but I\u2019m not close-minded to other points of view.\u201d\n\nGillibrand, a 52-year-old attorney and 10-year Senate member who announced her presidential run on Wednesday, couldn\u2019t have found a better case study for her presidential pitch if she had invented one from scratch. And sure enough, she referenced Desy \u2015 anonymously \u2015 in virtually every subsequent speech she delivered on the stump in all-important Iowa \u2015 from Boone to Des Moines.\n\nWhile registered Republicans like Desy won\u2019t decide who gets to take on Trump in the 2020 general election, a key part of Gillibrand\u2019s pitch to her fellow Democrats is that she has a record of winning over more conservative voters in rural areas.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images Gillibrand, surrounded by Republican senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas, speaks in 2013 about legislation on dealing with sexual assault in the military. She has touted her ability to work with conservatives.\n\n\u2018I Can Work With Anybody\u2019\n\nOver the course of a 36-hour tour of northwestern and central Iowa on Friday and Saturday, Gillibrand frequently mentioned how much the wintry, agriculture-heavy state reminded her of upstate New York \u2015 the region where she grew up and with her husband raises their two sons.\n\n\u201cI kind of recognize you, because you are hardy and you are hardworking and you don\u2019t give up. It\u2019s a lot like upstate New York Democrats,\u201d she told a capacity crowd of hundreds at the Peace Tree Brewing Co. outlet in Des Moines on Saturday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind the cold, either.\u201d\n\nI kind of recognize you, because you are hardy and you are hardworking and you don\u2019t give up. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)\n\nGillibrand began her political career by upsetting a GOP incumbent in a 2006 House race in a district where Republicans outnumbered Democrats 2 to 1. She recalled to her Iowa listeners that one skeptical consultant claimed the district had \u201cmore cows than Democrats,\u201d and she cited her win as evidence of her ability to prevail in hostile territory.\n\nBut in recounting that first foray into electoral politics, she also was careful to emphasize stances from that run that liberal voters would agree with: opposition to the Iraq War and support for what Gillibrand calls \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (though her plan might more accurately be described as a Medicare buy-in or public option).\n\nThe voters she wooed in that initial race \u201ccared about a lot of the same things you might have cared about \u2015 that rank-and-file Democrats cared about,\u201d Gillibrand said.\n\nShe even managed to make the case that her subsequent Senate wins in New York, a solid blue state in presidential voting, had further honed her political skills. She noted that outside of New York City, the state largely consists of moderate \u201cpurple\u201d and conservative \u201cred\u201d pockets.\n\nIn early 2009, Gillibrand was the surprise gubernatorial pick to temporarily fill the Seate seat Hillary Clinton gave up to become then-President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nGillibrand easily won a 2010 special election for the seat, and in 2012 she won a full term with 72 percent of the vote \u2015 which she told Iowa voters is the highest tally for any statewide candidate in New York history. (In her 2018 re-election win,she picked up 67 percent of the vote, losing many of the rural counties she carried in 2012.)\n\nAt her brewery appearance, Gillibrand appeared to hit her stride rhetorically, letting her sense of humor flow a little more freely than at her previous stops as she spoke against the backdrop of stacked beer barrels.\n\nA joke she had made elsewhere got bigger laughs than before.\n\n\u201cI work with [Sen.] Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on ending sexual harassment in Congress. I can work with anybody,\u201d she said, prompting hoots of laughter and then applause from the crowd.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Nati Harnik Gillibrand greets voters at the Pierce Street Coffee Works caf\u00e9 in Sioux City, Iowa, on Friday. At that stop and others, she pitched herself as a Democrat capable of attracting support from rural voters who could prove crucial to Democratic hopes of winning the White House in 2020.\n\n\u2018Not A National Name\u2019\n\nGillibrand has the challenge \u2015 and perhaps the benefit \u2015 of entering the presidential race with relatively little national name recognition. It\u2019s a reality that she noted at the close of a well-attended question-and-answer session on Saturday at a coffee shop in Ames, thanking local Democrats for showing up even though she is \u201cnot a national name.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one reason why Gillibrand barely registered in a mid-December poll of Iowa Democrats about their preferred presidential candidates in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. (Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both of whom are considering presidential bids, took first and second place, respectively.)\n\nBut it also gives her the chance to shape her brand with voters without having to undo any major preconceived notions about her.\n\nAnd Gillibrand\u2019s argument that her success in rural areas \u2015 as well as in suburbs \u2015 makes her uniquely equipped to take on Trump attempts to turn what may be her greatest liability into a selling point.\n\nThe more conservative stances she took on guns and immigration in the first stages of her political career have prompted scrutiny. In her first House race, she tried to outflank her Republican opponent from the right when it came to cracking down illegal immigration. She also earned an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association for her support of gun rights. (As recently as February 2009, she boasted of keeping two guns under her bed.)\n\nIn Iowa, Gillibrand parried queries about her past stances without getting flustered, chalking up her evolution to more progressive positions to insights she gained upon becoming a senator.\n\nShe is a workhorse in the Senate and that\u2019s one thing I do appreciate. Jefferson Fink, Des Moines voter\n\nResponding to a question from a Democratic activist in Sioux City on Friday about why the NRA once considered her an ally in the fight against greater gun regulation, she grew emotional describing how meeting the parents of a teenager in Brooklyn killed by gun violence helped change her mind about the need to toughen firearm laws. It\u2019s part of what inspired her, she said, to back 2011 legislation cracking down on illegal gun trafficking.\n\n\u201cSince [meeting those parents] 10 years ago, I have been 100 percent trying to end gun violence. I proudly have an \u2018F\u2019 rating from the NRA,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowd responded with approving applause.\n\nBernie Scolaro, a Sioux City public school teacher, was the only Democrat over the course of the trip who told HuffPost that she associated Gillibrand with the successful effort to pressure former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken (D) to resign in December 2017. Gillibrand was the first senator to call for Franken to leave after he faced multiple accusations of unwanted groping and other sexual misconduct.\n\nFranken was popular as an effective Senate voice against Trump, and some Democratic donors have expressed anger that Gillibrand fueled the effort to oust him from office. But she has vehemently defended her action, noting that Franken had been accused credibly by eight women of misconduct when she called on him to resign.\n\nAs Gillibrand spoke at a house party, Scolaro asked the senator about her role in the Franken matter and the criticism it has sparked. Gillibrand replied that she spoke out because she believed she could no longer speak credibly to her teenage son about how to treat women respectfully if she did not act on those same principles in the U.S. Senate.\n\nScolaro seemed persuaded by the answer. \u201cShe was genuine and [Gillibrand\u2019s response] was from the heart,\u201d the woman said afterward.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Matthew Putney Leading Democrats are quickly lining up for presidential bids. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke in Des Moines shortly after announcing her intention to run.\n\nA Focus On Electability\n\nGillibrand is the second Senate Democrat to announce presidential ambitions \u2015 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) jumped into the race on Dec. 31. Those two are not expected to be the last; Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Corey Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are mulling candidacies. And as the party awaits the decisions by Biden and Sanders, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) jumped into the race earlier this month.\n\nUnlike many in what will be a crowded field, Gillibrand doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a particular ideological \u201clane.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of Sanders-style references to Nordic nations, Gillibrand cites her faith in God and the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d when explaining her support for policies like paid family leave. On a key education issue, she tends to stress making the acquisition of professional skills more affordable, rather than eliminating tuition at public colleges (though she has co-sponsored a bill that would do the latter for families making less than $125,000 annually).\n\nAt the same time, Gillibrand is leaning into her opposition to the influence of money in politics, calling for public financing of political campaigns. Like Warren, she has sworn off money from corporate political action committees and support from super PACs.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Gillibrand has gotten behind ambitious progressive policies and legislation in the last two years. She co-sponsored Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation in September 2017, and rolled out her own bill last May that aimed to put payday lenders out of business. In June, she came out in favor of abolishing ICE \u2015 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that has elicited notoriety for its aggressive raids against undocumented immigrants in the nation\u2019s interior.\n\nStill, Gillibrand appears to be betting that touting her electability is a way to distinguish herself among a likely raft of candidates whose populist bona fides are harder to assail.\n\nThat could be a potent formula for Democratic primary voters whose interest in finding a candidate with general-election viability \u2015 who first and foremost can beat Trump \u2015 seems only to have intensified since he took office.\n\n\u201cShe is a workhorse in the Senate and that\u2019s one thing I do appreciate,\u201d said Jefferson Fink, 28, who works at Kitchen Collage in downtown Des Moines. (Gillibrand stopped at the cooking specialty store on Saturday afternoon to bake cookies and discuss her family\u2019s culinary habits.)\n\nFink supported Sanders in Iowa\u2019s 2016 caucuses and he said he would be fine with him entering the race again. This time around though, Fink said he does not yet have a favorite.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-friends-host-claims-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-will-tax-70-percent-of-paychecks_us_5c3ca3bbe4b0e0baf53f81d7": "Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt told New York Post columnist and Fox News contributor Michael Goodwin that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wants to tax his paycheck at 70 percent, when that\u2019s not what the congresswoman has proposed at all.\n\nOn \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday, Earhardt asked Goodwin about why he thinks Ocasio-Cortez has so much support within the Democratic party.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear they\u2019re going to tax 70 percent of your paycheck, if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets her way, how do they have so much support?\u201d she asked Goodwin.\n\nGoodwin responded by saying that \u201cyoung people today are not being educated properly in schools\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know the history of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know the history of other countries. They don\u2019t understand economics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s charming and delightful in many ways,\u201d he said of Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cShe got an economics degree from Boston University and she clearly doesn\u2019t understand how the unemployment rate works. She said that it\u2019s low because so many people have two jobs. Now, how do you get an economics degree from a major college and not understand that that\u2019s not how the unemployment rate works? How is that possible?\u201d\n\nAinsley Earhardt falsely claims that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to \u201ctax 70 percent of your paycheck\u201d pic.twitter.com/Cko4ctP0BM \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) January 14, 2019\n\nThere is so much to unpack there.\n\nFor one, Ocasio-Cortez did not propose taking 70 percent of anyone\u2019s income. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the 29-year-old suggested applying this marginal rate only to earnings amounting to more than $10 million. This means that those impacted would pay a much lower share of their income overall and the average tax rate for working Americans could potentially go down under her idea.\n\nA report in CNBC explains how Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea is in line with America\u2019s economic history. While the top tax rate stood above 90 percent throughout the 1950s, deductions and tax avoidance led to taxes on the rich being \u201cnot that much higher,\u201d according to a 2017 article by the Tax Foundation.\n\nA top rate of 70 percent was active up until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan took office. The most affluent 1 percent were paying an average rate of 30.5 percent. By 1989, when Reagan left office, the top rate was reduced to 28 percent \u2014 but average tax rates for the most affluent had only slightly dropped to 27.9 percent.\n\nSince then, the last three decades have had top rates below 40 percent. Many have tried to change that. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 54.2 percent rate for income above $10 million in his 2016 presidential campaign proposal and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposed 43.6 percent for earnings above $5 million.\n\nAs for the congresswoman\u2019s comments on unemployment, she discussed her understanding of how it\u2019s calculated in July 2018 after the press and many members of the GOP ripped her words apart. It\u2019s unclear as to why Goodwin is bringing up the remarks again, half a year later.\n\nUnsure why you leap to interpret my comments in the dimmest light possible - almost as though you have an agenda\ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nCLEARLY, unemployment is unchanged by the # of jobs each person has.\n\n\n\nBut low unemployment doesn\u2019t tell the full story.

To that, Trump said, \u201cwho cares.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicare-for-all-kaiser-poll_us_5c47e6cae4b0b6693675059b": "Americans are pretty keen on the idea of creating a new government-run insurance program, or at least expanding an existing one, in order to make sure everybody can finally get affordable health care.\n\nBut Americans are more enthusiastic about proposals to make enrollment in government-run insurance voluntary rather than mandatory. And once Americans hear some of the common attacks that conservatives deploy against government-run insurance schemes, they get more skittish about the idea.\n\nThose are some of the key findings in a new poll from the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The results say a lot about why so many Democrats are talking about ideas like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d these days \u2015 and why, to succeed, those Democrats still have a lot of work to do.\n\nFor the first time in roughly a decade, Democrats rather than Republicans are the ones dreaming and talking about passing major new health care legislation. That\u2019s because Democrats for most of the last 10 years had their hands full trying to stop Republicans from undermining or repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHenry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDemocrats are in the majority now, which means they can convene committee hearings, craft legislation and even put it to a vote \u2015 all with an eye to 2020, when Democrats hope to recapture the Senate and the White House.\n\nAnd there is a lot to do, Democrats realize.\n\nThe boldest, most sweeping idea Democrats have is the one that Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, made famous in his 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He and his allies want to create a single government-run program that would cover all medical expenses and enroll every single person living in the U.S.\n\nMedicare for all, as they call it, has become a rallying cry for progressives. Supporters include Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected Democrat from New York, and three Democratic senators \u2015 Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2015 who are running (or formally exploring runs) for the presidency in 2020.\n\nThe idea is also popular, according to the new Kaiser poll. Fifty-six percent of Americans \u201cstrongly favor\u201d or \u201csomewhat favor\u201d the idea, compared with 42 percent who \u201csomewhat oppose\u201d or \u201cstrongly oppose.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s an open question just how strong or solid that support is.\n\nWhen Kaiser asked respondents whether they thought they could keep their current insurance under a Medicare for all scheme, 57 percent said they could. In reality, the whole point of Medicare for all would be to wipe away current insurance arrangements and replace them with a new public plan.\n\nProponents of Medicare for all know this. They argue that the public plan would be simpler, more comprehensive and ultimately less costly for most Americans.\n\nKaiser actually tested to see how some of those arguments would affect public opinion and, sure enough, people were even more excited about Medicare for all when they heard, among other things, that it would eliminate premiums, copays and deductibles.\n\nBut Kaiser also tested some of the arguments that Republicans and other opponents of Medicare for all have made against such schemes \u2015 and already are making now. When respondents heard that Medicare for all would eliminate private insurance, for example, support dropped dramatically, with just 37 percent favoring it and 58 percent opposing.\n\nKaiser also asked respondents about some other Democratic ideas that call for creating or expanding government-run insurance but without making it a system for everybody. These ideas include some relatively moderate steps, like opening up Medicare to people 55 and over \u2015 or offering Medicaid to anybody without access to employer coverage.\n\nYet another idea Kaiser tested is a more ambitious initiative that would create a new government-run insurance plan open to anybody, on a voluntary basis. In this scheme, employers would have the option to keep offering their own plans, thereby giving their employees a choice.\n\nIn Kaiser\u2019s polls, these proposals were even more popular than Medicare for all, although Kaiser didn\u2019t test how these ideas held up to common conservative criticisms.\n\nAnother poll finding was about priorities: 51 percent of self-identified Democrats think it\u2019s more important for their party to focus on improving and protecting the Affordable Care Act, while 38 percent think it\u2019s more important to pass Medicare for all.\n\nThis has not been the focus of much political debate lately, although bolstering the 2010 health care law is something that nearly all Democrats have said they want to do.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-ted-lieu-2020-endorsement_us_5c4f3832e4b0d9f9be67b9e0": "Rep.

One of these is the idea that every American who needs and wants a job has the right to one, at a livable wage, with decent benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s called a federal jobs guarantee, and it has some heavyweight support. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) backs the idea and has said he will release a detailed plan in the fall. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has introduced legislation that would see a three-year pilot project set up to guarantee jobs in 15 regions of high unemployment. Among the bill\u2019s co-sponsors is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who tweeted in support of the policy in April.\n\nIf Republicans could give $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest among us, why can\u2019t we invest a similar amount in a guaranteed jobs plan for regular Americans who are unemployed and willing to work to better their local community? \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 17, 2018\n\nAnd when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez swept to victory over Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), a powerful establishment Democrat, in a congressional primary last month, a jobs guarantee featured high on her list of policies.\n\nSo the idea is gaining momentum. But what exactly is a jobs guarantee, and how could it work?\n\nThe idea\n\nThe premise is that everyone should be entitled to a good job, one that pays at least $15 an hour and comes with benefits such as health care, family leave policies and child care.\n\nThe program would be administered at a local level, with federal funding, and jobs would be fitted to people, not the other way around. The aim \u201cis not to change the worker in some fundamental way,\u201d said Stephanie Kelton, a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University and formerly a senior advisor to Sanders. \u201cYou take the worker the way they are and you fit the job to the worker.\u201d\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Stephanie Kelton, a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University, is a strong proponent of guaranteed jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple at its core level,\u201d Kelton said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove anything, you don\u2019t have to meet certain requirements. It\u2019s just an open-ended offer of employment for anyone seeking work, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d\n\nHer work, as part of a team at the nonpartisan Levy Economics Institute that analyzed and modeled the idea, has informed Sanders\u2019 support for guaranteed jobs.\n\nThe aim\n\nTo eliminate involuntary unemployment by creating living-wage, socially beneficial jobs for the millions of Americans who want and need work \u2015 essentially making employment a fundamental right.\n\nIt\u2019s not exclusively tailored to address a certain section of the population \u2015 \u201cit\u2019s the whole gamut of potential people who come through the door,\u201d Kelton says \u2015 but one benefit would be the chance to address people marginalized from the workforce, who are disproportionately women and people of color.\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters A supporter holds a sign while listening to Hillary Clinton speak at a rally in April 2016 to celebrate New York increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nIt could have a significant effect on poverty levels. In 2016, around 9.5 million people in America who spent more than half the year working or looking for work were nevertheless in poverty. A full-time worker at $15 an hour could lift a family of up to five out of poverty, according to the Levy report.\n\nThe wage and benefits package would set a minimum standard for private businesses, supporters say, as they would have to match the government offer. But the policy would not compete with the private sector beyond setting that minimum floor, suggests Kelton, who says that the program would be elastic depending on the state of the economy \u2015 growing in downturns and shrinking during recoveries.\n\nIt would be for the community to determine the type of jobs they want and need. These could be jobs in infrastructure, teaching, caring for the young and elderly, environmental restoration or green energy, to name a few. In Sanders\u2019 draft proposal for a jobs guarantee, he writes: \u201cPeople working under the federal job guarantee will be serving their communities and their country, uniting us together in a common purpose, rebuilding the social fabric of our nation.\u201d\n\nWhy now?\n\nThe idea of a jobs guarantee is not new. \u201cThis is a revival of the kind of thing that FDR fought for, that Martin Luther King fought for,\u201d Kelton said. And the era of Trump and right-wing populism has increased the appetite of some in the Democratic Party to run on big, progressive policies.\n\nIt may seem odd that a jobs guarantee is gaining mainstream political attention at a time when unemployment is at 3.8 percent, the lowest level since 2000. But critics say that figure doesn\u2019t reflect the reality that many Americans who want to work are unable to, and feel left behind. Kelton estimates this group includes some 16 to 17 million people.\n\nMike Blake / Reuters Some economists would say the economy is at full employment, but many Americans remain excluded from the workplace or are in precarious, low-paying jobs.\n\nThe figures, for example, do not count as unemployed those who are not looking for work or those who want work but hadn\u2019t searched for a job in the four weeks prior to the survey. And they do include those who are working part-time only because they are unable to find full-time work (an estimated 4.9 million people). Then there\u2019s pay. An increase in employment has not corresponded with a marked increase in wages \u2015 as might be expected in a hotter labor market.\n\nAnd even if employment levels are improving, supporters say guaranteed public employment could help safeguard people against the next crisis \u2015 whether that\u2019s another financial crash, mass job loss due to automation, or something else.\n\nFinally, Americans seem keen on the idea of guaranteed jobs. Recent polling commissioned from Civis Analytics by The Nation found 52 percent of people in favor of the idea. Polling from the Center for American Progress found even more positive results, with 79 percent of people in favor of guaranteed jobs.\n\nIt's not just a job guarantee that is popular nationally. We found that everything from wage boards to direct hiring to expanded rental assistance earn overwhelming support. https://t.co/E7kiPuIuY4 pic.twitter.com/SKNfjtyTtT \u2014 Jeremy Slevin (@jeremyslevin) July 3, 2018\n\nHow much would it cost?\n\nIt depends on which version you look at \u2015 and costs would obviously fluctuate based on participation \u2015 but whichever way you cut it, the figures are high.\n\nThe Levy plan would come in at around $378 billion a year in the first five years, rising to $415 billion in the second five years. A broadly similar jobs guarantee set out in a paper by William Darity Jr. and Mark Paul of Duke University and Darrick Hamilton of the Milano School of International Affairs, commissioned by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, would cost around $543 billion a year, or just under 3 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\nThe Center for American Progress has a more limited but cheaper version. Its proposal would focus purely on providing guaranteed, $15-an-hour jobs to people without college degrees. The center estimates this would scoop up around 4.4 million workers at a rough cost of $158 billion, \u201capproximately one-quarter of Trump\u2019s proposed tax cut for the wealthy on an annual basis.\u201d\n\nBut all of these plans say the costs would be substantially offset by increases in tax revenue as more people entered the workforce, and decreases in the uptake of Social Security programs as well as GDP growth and increased productivity.\n\nHow would we pay for it?\n\n\u201cIt would be funded the way everything else is funded,\u201d Kelton said. \u201cThe government will pay for it.\u201d The Levy report doesn\u2019t include new taxes to fund the project, but analyzes what would happen to the economy if the government simply cut a check for the program. \u201cWhat the models show is that you can do this without creating an inflation problem,\u201d Kelton said, \u201cand therefore why would you pay for it with tax increases of one kind or another?\u201d\n\nThe program could even \u201cpay for itself,\u201d the Levy report says, taking into account reduction in crime, better health, better social and economic stability and reductions in Social Security spending.\n\nThe Levy models say that if you bring 15 million people into the jobs guarantee, the private sector would benefit from the subsequent increased buying power, creating around 4.2 million additional jobs. \u201cIn the aggregate,\u201d Kelton said, \u201cit\u2019s clear the economy as a whole does far better, and that means that the private sector does far better.\u201d\n\nHow much to pay: $15/hr + benefits\n\n\n\nKinds of jobs: CARE for people/planet/community\n\n\n\nMacro effects: ~4.2 million new private sector jobs; Improves state-level gov budgets by ~$53B/yr; boost real GDP ~$560B/yr https://t.co/U15otjX9AF https://t.co/0e5YUwQfXm \u2014 Stephanie Kelton (@StephanieKelton) July 3, 2018\n\nDarity\u2019s paper is not focused on the financing question, but it suggests the program could be financed through reductions in Social Security spending and through new tax policies like a financial transactions tax, a carbon tax and a modified estate tax. But ultimately, Darity told HuffPost, \u201cthe program is, de facto, self-financing \u2015 government makes the outlay and the program will generate the tax revenue to support it.\u201d\n\nWhat do the critics say?\n\nThe jobs guarantee is a polarizing policy, with critics on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nA key concern with an idea this big and potentially unwieldy is the actual logistics of implementing it. How would the government and local communities be able to come up with suitable, socially beneficial jobs for potentially tens of millions of people? For Matt Bruenig, founder of the People\u2019s Policy Project, a think tank, this is the main problem. \u201cThe idea that thousands of administrations across the country will be able to usefully employ random flows of labor with random sets of skills in random durations is fairly implausible,\u201d he wrote in March.\n\nSimilarly, Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, wrote in April: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the public sector managerial capacity right now to oversee the work of 11 million people \u2015 who will be coming from varying backgrounds and labor qualifications \u2015 and ensure that they will be perceived as undertaking socially useful tasks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, criticisms from the right tend to focus on cost. Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says he applauds the goal of encouraging good jobs at high wages, but calls the proposal of a guaranteed jobs program \u201cfantasy land.\u201d His criticisms are many and vociferous.\n\nA jobs program could scoop up far more workers than envisioned, maybe 30 million, Riedl told HuffPost. \u201cThe wages and benefits would be higher than what 40 percent of workers already earn,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore they would not only attract the unemployed but those out of the workforce, retirees and anyone earning less or who is unhappy with their job.\u201d At the $56,000 some advocates have estimated each job would cost, the whole program could cost between $1 trillion and $2 trillion a year, he says.\n\nRiedl argues such a program would also \u201ceviscerate\u201d low-paying sectors like retail, fast food and landscaping. \u201cThe laws of supply and demand are very clear that not all industries, especially in rural areas where costs are lower, can afford to pay $15 an hour plus full benefits,\u201d he said. And even if the private sector could afford to pay, he says, many workers might be attracted to the government program because they\u2019d be less likely to get fired from a guaranteed job scheme.\n\nMike Blake / Reuters Critics of the jobs guarantee say low-paid sectors like retail would be \"eviscerated\" by competition from better-paid government jobs.\n\nWashington Post columnist Robert Samuelson writes that guaranteed jobs would \u201calmost certainly be a disaster,\u201d and that such a program would add to the deficit and lead to inflation. In a May column, he expressed his opposition bluntly: \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s taken seriously is evidence that many Democrats, like Republicans before them, embrace loony economic agendas that are more public-relations gestures than sensible policy.\u201d\n\nHas any other country done it?\n\nNot to the universal extent envisioned here, but two countries have initiated forms of a jobs guarantee.\n\nIn Argentina, the Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Desocupados (Program for Unemployed Male and Female Heads of Households) was introduced after a financial crisis in 2001. Federally funded and locally administered, the program offered guaranteed employment of at least four hours a day in community-created jobs to the unemployed heads of households. The program was phased out after a few years and replaced with more traditional social spending efforts.\n\nAhmad Masood / Reuters Women work at a dry pond on the outskirts of Kolkata, India, under the National Rural Employment Guarantee, an anti-poverty plan that provides 100 days of employment a year to tens of millions of rural poor people.\n\nAnd India has the National Rural Employment Guarantee, which gives up to 100 days of guaranteed paid employment per year to workers from rural households. It was found to increase earnings in low-income households by 13 percent and reduce the gender pay gap. The program is still going, but payments to workers are frequently late and the government has been accused of denying it funds.\n\nWill it be implemented in the U.S.?\n\nNot without a radical restructuring of the political landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s going to require Democrats to take over the House and the Senate and win back the White House,\u201d Kelton said. \u201cThe GOP is not going to deliver this to us \u2015 we are going to have to fight for it.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-calls-trump-kim-jong-un-meeting-a-positive-step_us_5b201b62e4b0adfb826ea86f": "Sen.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters following the 2016 presidential primary. They argue that Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s early support from superdelegates created an air of inevitability that unfairly tilted the race in her favor, whether or not it affected the contest\u2019s final outcome.\n\nAt the DNC\u2019s summer meeting in Chicago, which began earlier this week, a small but vocal group of DNC members critical of the reform plan has argued it would diminish the influence of African-Americans and other minorities.\n\nThe argument, presented chiefly by veteran black officials such as 2016 Democratic National Convention Committee CEO Leah Daughtry and former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile, is that, after decades of hard work climbing into the halls of power, black Americans enjoy stronger representation among the ranks of superdelegates than ever before. Their presence in Democratic officialdom ensures black influence on the presidential nominating process even if ordinary, \u201cpledged\u201d convention delegates do not.\n\nAs a member of the DNC\u2019s powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee, Daughtry helped develop the superdelegate reform proposal and voted in favor of its passage out of committee in late June. The plan, supported by DNC Chairman Tom Perez and key Sanders loyalists, strips superdelegates of the ability to vote on the first ballot at a presidential nominating convention \u2015 unless a candidate already has such a large delegate advantage from caucus and primary wins that he or she would win the nomination without superdelegate support.\n\nMembers of Daughtry\u2019s community in Brooklyn, New York, beseeched her to reconsider her support for the reform in the weeks after the committee\u2019s vote, prompting her to change her mind, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople from my community who have their various issues \u2015 with me, with the [Congressional Black Caucus], with other people \u2015 they\u2019re like, \u2018You get on our nerves, but at least we know you\u2019re in the room for us. And that\u2019s better than us having nobody in the room,\u2019\u201d Daughtry said.\n\nThe grassroots are more diverse. And more participation from the grassroots would mean more diversity at the convention. Ron Harris, Minnesota DNC member\n\nMichelle Bryant, a Democratic Party activist from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who was attending the DNC meeting as a guest, said the reform might have an especially acute effect on black convention representation in Wisconsin, where African-Americans are less than 7 percent of the population but benefit from a disproportionate presence in party officialdom.\n\nThe Democratic officials advocating a reduction in superdelegate influence claim it is essential to winning the confidence of the millennials who went for Sanders (I-Vt.) and are less likely to formally identify with the Democratic Party.\n\nBut Daughtry claimed that in her African-American community in Brooklyn, millennial activists, many of whom voted for Sanders, do not care.\n\nAsked whether she thought concerns about superdelegates were mainly limited to white voters, Daughtry replied, \u201cYeah, in some cases, I do.\u201d\n\nDaughtry also denied that Perez\u2019s decision to dismiss her as head of the party\u2019s scouting efforts for the 2020 national convention site had contributed to her change of heart on the reform proposal.\n\n\u201cI have more integrity than that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have always supported the prerogative of the chair to hire who he or she pleases.\u201d\n\nDaughtry\u2019s and Bryant\u2019s criticism echoes the already-public objections of Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and veteran white DNC member Bob Mulholland of California, who dramatically compared the reform proposal to the violent suppression of the civil rights movement in the 1960s.\n\nHowever, proponents of the reform \u2015 who include both Sanders and Clinton voters of diverse racial backgrounds \u2015 expressed confidence Friday that the DNC membership would approve the proposal Saturday morning.\n\nIn making their case, reform proponents maintain that the change would actually increase the influence of people of color in the party, since the pledged delegates were more diverse than the superdelegates.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention in 2016, 20 percent of superdelegates were black and 36 percent were people of color, while 25 percent of pledged delegates were black and 50 percent were people of color, according to public data on fliers distributed by reform supporters.\n\nThe greater diversity among pledged convention delegates simply reflects the fact that even in the Democratic Party, the racial makeup of elected officials has yet to completely reflect the diversity of the party\u2019s voters, according to Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa.\n\n\u201cThe rule strengthens minority and ethnic groups\u2019 position in our party,\u201d he said.\n\nRather than reflect a division between black and white Democrats, the disagreement over the role of superdelegates appeared to break down along generational lines.\n\nDNC Vice Chair Michael Blake, Wisconsin Democratic Party Vice Chair David Bowen, DNC Black Caucus Treasurer Khary Pennebaker and Minnesota DNC member Ron Harris are among the younger black DNC officials who support reform and have publicly advocated for it.\n\n\u201cThe grassroots are more diverse. And more participation from the grassroots would mean more diversity at the convention,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris, who travels across the Midwest in his capacity as chairman of the DNC\u2019s Midwestern Caucus, said he often meets voters who agree with Democratic policy positions but have the vague impression that the party is not attuned to their needs. Diminishing the power of superdelegates was about demonstrating to those Americans that the party was committed to giving them an equal say, Harris argued.\n\n\u201cThe average American will never be able to say what a superdelegate is or a DNC member or even articulate what we did this weekend,\u201d Harris said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-groups-keith-ellison-domestic-abuse-allegations_us_5b71fa9de4b0bdd0620c11e9": "Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Rep.

The group applauded the resignation of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in May amid overwhelming domestic abuse evidence and has supported an investigation of Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, who remains in office as he battles allegations of groping.\n\n\u201cAny time we see allegations, we take it seriously, and we are watching what is happening in Minnesota to understand the facts of this particular situation,\u201d said the DAGA\u2019s executive director, Sean Rankin.\n\nThe accusations against Ellison came to light on Saturday night, less than three days before Tuesday\u2019s competitive primary for the Democratic nomination for Minnesota attorney general.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Karen Monahan\u2019s son Austin Monahan said his mother went through \u201cpure hell\u201d after ending her relationship with Ellison. Austin Monahan wrote that in mid-2017 he found a two-minute video showing Ellison violently dragging her off a bed as he cursed at her. Austin Monahan also said he found hundreds of text messages between his mother and Ellison that showed Ellison alternating between an affectionate and apologetic tone and \u201cvictim shaming, bully[ing] her, and threaten[ing] her if she went public.\u201d The post tagged two of Ellison\u2019s rivals in the Democratic attorney general primary: former state Supreme Court clerk Matt Pelikan and state Rep. Debra Hilstrom.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday afternoon, Karen Monahan confirmed the accuracy of what her son wrote.\n\n\u201cEvery statement he made was true,\u201d she said. Apparently addressing Ellison, she added, \u201cYou know you did that to me.\u201d\n\nEllison acknowledged that he was in a relationship with Monahan that ended in late 2016 and flatly denied the existence of a video documenting physical abuse.\n\n\u201cI still care deeply for her well-being,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThis video does not exist because I never behaved in this way, and any characterization otherwise is false.\u201d\n\n[Woman are] silenced by our system of oppression. Toni Van Pelt, National Organization for Women\n\nIn a follow-up report, Minnesota Public Radio analyzed hundreds of text messages between Ellison and Monahan that she provided. MPR said it found an exchange in which she told him that she planned to write about their \u201cjourney\u201d in a memoir of some kind, and Ellison responded, \u201cHorrible attack on my privacy, unreal.\u201d In December 2017 she reportedly mentioned a video of him dragging her off the bed, and he did not respond.\n\nNone of the text messages offered evidence of physical abuse, according to MPR. And in a long statement on Sunday night detailing what she called \u201cnarcissist abuse\u201d at Ellison\u2019s hands, Monahan did not once refer to such a video.\n\nShe told CNN, in a story published Monday, that she had misplaced the thumb drive where she was storing the video after moving homes and that in any event, the onus was not on her to produce the \u201cembarrassing and traumatizing\u201d video. However, CNN spoke with three of her friends who remembered her recalling the incident in the months after it allegedly happened.\n\nThis is also not the first time a woman has accused Ellison of abusive behavior. Amy Alexander alleged in October 2006 that he acted like a \u201clittle dictator\u201d during an affair they had in the mid-2000s and that he shoved her during a confrontation in which he was trying to silence her. He subsequently secured a restraining order against her.\n\nJust two groups have called on Ellison to withdraw from the race: the online women\u2019s rights group UltraViolet, and the National Organization for Women.\n\nWe believe women. We believe Karen Monahan.\n\n\n\nDomestic abusers do not belong in any position of power. Keith Ellison should withdraw his candidacy for Minnesota\u2019s Attorney General and resign from the House of Representatives now. Our statement: https://t.co/13cqimp760 pic.twitter.com/csIvlM8FWt \u2014 UltraViolet (@UltraViolet) August 13, 2018\n\nToni Van Pelt, the president of NOW, told HuffPost that MPR\u2019s account of Monahan\u2019s accusations and Ellison\u2019s response to them was enough to convince her of Ellison\u2019s guilt. She interpreted Ellison\u2019s angry response to the idea that Monahan would write about their relationship as \u201ca chilling, threatening message.\u201d\n\nHe should withdraw from the election, and every man considering an election run with a similar history of abuse should rule it out as well, Van Pelt said.\n\nShe rejected the notion that Monahan\u2019s claims were less credible because of their timing so soon before the primary. Women who have survived abuse often suffer feelings of shame and fear of censure that prevents them from coming forward, Van Pelt said. \u201cThey\u2019re silenced by our system of oppression,\u201d she said.\n\nAs national organizations debate how to respond to the allegations against Ellison, his rivals in the attorney general race are showing no such hesitation. Before the scandal erupted, he was widely favored in the contest.\n\nOne of his opponents in the race, former Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley, called Ellison\u2019s denial of the charges \u201cvery Trump-like.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-establishment-is-beating-back-the-progressive-revolution-bernie-sanders-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-want-to-turn-the-tide_us_5b53722fe4b0de86f48d95a3": "Dan Videtich/The Washington Post via Getty Images Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the few progressive insurgents to win her primary so far this election cycle. She's hoping to improve the movement's record.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2015 The progressive revolution isn\u2019t going quite as planned.\n\nThe establishment is winning more Democratic primaries than progressives are, and the type of earth-shattering upsets that signified the Republicans\u2019 tea party wing was becoming an electoral force in 2010 have been few and far between. With just 19 states still left to hold their primaries, opportunities to shape the Democratic Party are slipping away.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic nominee for a House seat from New York, came to the Great Plains last Friday and Saturday to seize those opportunities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there are red states or blue states or purple states,\u201d Sanders said as he rallied for labor attorney Brent Welder, a Democratic congressional candidate, before a crowd of more than 2,000 people in a sweaty convention center auditorium. \u201cI believe that any state in this country where working people are struggling is a state that\u2019s ready to vote for justice.\u201d\n\nBut they face distinct challenges in different areas, illustrated in each of the three districts they campaigned in:\n\nKansas\u2019 3rd Congressional District: In a swing district in Kansas City and its suburbs, progressives need to convince some skeptical Democrats that they can actually win in a general election.\n\nKansas\u2019 4th Congressional District: In a blood-red district in Wichita and its surrounding rural areas, progressives need to pull off a general election upset.\n\nMissouri\u2019s 1st Congressional District: In this heavily Democratic urban district in St. Louis, progressives are going up against a long-standing political machine.\n\nThe progressive movement has succeeded in pushing some of its policy goals: record numbers of candidates are backing Medicare-for-All and swearing off corporate PAC donations. But so far, Democratic voters have mostly stuck with the establishment. Thirty percent of establishment non-incumbent candidates in Democratic primaries have triumphed, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. Just 22 percent of self-defined progressive candidates have won. (Since most primaries have more than two candidates, a majority of candidates in both categories lost.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an extraordinary number of progressives running,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who led the study. \u201cThey\u2019re doing well, but not as well as establishment challengers.\u201d\n\nOthers come to a similar conclusion: An analysis by The New York Times found just one-sixth of Democratic primary winners so far are affiliated with key progressive insurgent groups like Justice Democrats or Our Revolution \u2013 and many of them come from seats Democrats have little chance of winning in November. Of the swing-district candidates the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put on its Red-to-Blue list, just two have lost to progressive challengers. And only a single incumbent, House Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, has lost a seat in a primary. It\u2019s a far cry from the impact the tea party movement had eight years ago.\n\n\u2018I Don\u2019t Think There Is A Desire To Swing Far Left.\u2019\n\nThe afternoon of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s rally for Welder, one of his primary opponents in Kansas\u2019 3rd Congressional District, history teacher Tom Niermann, was knocking on doors. One voter, who was doing yard work, laid out his one qualification for a candidate: \u201cCan you beat Kevin Yoder?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a paramount concern in this swing district, where President Donald Trump is reviled \u2015 Democratic polling puts his approval rating at around 35 percent. Yoder is the Republican who represents this well-off congressional district, where 90 percent of the population has health insurance coverage and the median income is high enough to place in the top 20 percent of all congressional seats nationally. Yoder is considered vulnerable, and the DCCC made the district one of its first targets this cycle.\n\nThe original Democratic favorite in the district, businesswoman Andrea Ramsey, dropped out of the race in December after it was reported she had sexually harassed and fired a subordinate. Since then, a six-way field has emerged, with Niermann winning the backing of most local elected officials, Welder becoming the favorite of progressives and Sharice Davids picking up the backing of EMILY\u2019s List with her standout r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nOf the three, Niermann is the clear moderate. He\u2019s avoided taking divisive positions, such as supporting the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (he instead supports \u201cputting limits on ICE\u2019s power\u201d). And he won an endorsement from a moderate Republican, state Sen. Barbara Bollier, earlier in the week. He\u2019s running a campaign focused on the backlash over former Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s (R) cuts to education and on support for gun control.\n\n\u201cFor 26 years, I\u2019ve taught everything from the American Revolution to the civil rights movement,\u201d Niermann says in his first television ad. \u201cI\u2019ve never imagined I\u2019d have to teach my kids how to react if someone busted through the door with an assault rifle.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Niermann raised concerns that Welder\u2019s aggressive agenda could alienate the swing voters needed to win the district.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a desire to swing far left,\u201d Niermann said. \u201cI think there is a desire to remove the far right and to return to sensible government.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thought Welder\u2019s embrace of Sanders was making his primary opponent unelectable, Niermann responded simply: \u201cIn a general election, yes.\u201d\n\nWelder, later Friday at the rally with Sanders, was clearly aware of questions about his general election viability. His volunteers passed out signs declaring \u201cWin with Welder,\u201d and he boasted of a poll showing him leading Yoder by 7 percentage points. But his strategy seemed off.\n\nHe noted thousands of voters in Kansas and millions of voters nationwide who backed Trump after supporting President Barack Obama four or eight years earlier.\n\n\u201cThese are not the country club Republican types; these are working families,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cBut the Democrats can win back these working-class Trump voters. We can unite the divides in our party and inspire infrequent voters and young people.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one problem: The 3rd District isn\u2019t full of Obama-Trump voters. It\u2019s full of their political opposite, voters who backed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 and then supported Democrat Hillary Clinton four years later. Romney had won the district by 10 percentage points, then Clinton won by a single point four years later.\n\nWelder\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to interview requests. His first television ad emphasizes his work for the Obama campaign, complete with a \u201cYes, we Kansas\u201d slogan. He has endorsed Medicare for all, sworn off corporate donations and backed a $15 minimum wage.\n\nToday we released our first tv ad, \u201cYes We Kansas!\u201d It highlights my work for Obama, support for Medicare for All, assault weapons ban, & lifelong dedication to fighting the corrupting influence of corporate money in our elections. #ksleg #ks03 #yeswekansas #overyoder #kansas pic.twitter.com/4a8wUnBXyN \u2014 Brent Welder (@BrentWelder) July 16, 2018\n\nVoters at the rally were receptive to Welder\u2019s message \u2015 even if not all were committed to backing him, and many had come across the border from Missouri.\n\nA mother and son illustrated some of the divides.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for somebody to fix what Brownback destroyed,\u201d said Liz Pfau, a customer service representative from Roeland Park, Kansas, describing Niermann\u2019s pitch almost exactly. \u201cIt frightens me to death that I can go to a college campus and the person next to me could be holding an assault rifle.\u201d\n\nHer son, Ethan Stone, a rising college senior, seemed more likely to back Welder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone who is as close to my ideology as possible,\u201d he said, although he admitted, \u201cI know some people are voting strategically for who can beat Yoder.\u201d\n\nWhat could have been a straightforward progressive vs. moderate matchup shifted when Davids entered the race in February. She\u2019s the candidate whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stands out the most: She\u2019s a Native American lesbian raised by an Army veteran who is a single mom. She worked her way from community college to Cornell Law School to a White House fellowship while also mastering martial arts and competing in two professional MMA fights. EMILY\u2019s List has promised to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to back her candidacy. (Davids has far less cash in her campaign account than Welder or Niermann, according to Federal Election Commission records.)\n\nIntroducing herself to voters while knocking on doors in the suburb of Mission, Davids leaned heavily on that r\u00e9sum\u00e9, relating her life story to voters and handing out flyers that said she was \u201cChanging the face of Kansas politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does matter to me that there\u2019s such a narrow range of experiences that have been represented in our government,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI can see how one different voice changes the conversation around policy.\u201d\n\nTo her, the other options in the race blended together. \u201cAt that time, frankly, it was four white guys in the race,\u201d she said of her decision to jump in. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I saw anybody who could beat Yoder, or was speaking to something new and different.\u201d\n\nLeft-Wing Wins, Right-Wing Districts\n\nJ. Pat Carter/The Washington Post via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders and congressional nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned with James Thompson, who is running in a deep-red district in Kansas.\n\nWhile Welder still needs to triumph in his primary, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders\u2019 first stop in Kansas was in a district where their endorsed candidate is nearly certain to make it to the general election. They were campaigning for James Thompson, an Army veteran and civil rights lawyer who nearly won a special election for the state\u2019s 4th District in April 2017.\n\nThe 46 percent of the vote Thompson won was considered a triumph of sorts: Trump had defeated Clinton by a 60 percent to 33 percent margin. But political prognosticators now give him little chance of winning in a larger-turnout race. Election forecasters label last year\u2019s victor, GOP Rep. Ron Estes, as safe.\n\nThis points to the second problem for progressives: Many of them are winning Democratic primaries in districts Democrats have little chance of winning in November. One in four progressive primary winners is running in a district with a partisan voter index greater than R +15, which means Republicans have won the past two presidential elections in the district by an average of 15 points. Among candidates whom the Sanders-backed Our Revolution have endorsed in GOP-held districts, just two have won primaries in districts with a PVI less than R +10.\n\n\u201cIf you have a district with almost no Democrats, you have a very small primary electorate. And so it\u2019s not surprising when a very left-wing candidate wins,\u201d Kamarck explained. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have much meaning, at least in the near future, in terms of what the Democratic Party will do if they get power in Congress.\u201d\n\nThere was genuine enthusiasm for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez \u2015 their rally was moved to a bigger venue because of strong demand \u2015 and they plan on proving Thompson\u2019s skeptics wrong.\n\n\u201cThey say that the movement won\u2019t work in Kansas,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told supporters backstage at the rally. \u201cThey say don\u2019t go to Kansas, they won\u2019t accept you there, they won\u2019t share your values there. And we all know that that is not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know squat,\u201d Thompson added.\n\nThe Next Ocasio-Cortez\n\nThe night after the rally for Welder, Ocasio-Cortez traveled 250 miles to the east to campaign for Cori Bush, a nurse who became a prominent leader of the protests after the 2014 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the Democratic primary, Bush is running against Rep. William Lacy Clay, who has held the seat since 2001. Before then, his father, Bill Clay, had held the seat since 1969, helping create the Congressional Black Caucus during his tenure.\n\nBush\u2019s campaign bears a resemblance to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset victory over Crowley: Both Missouri\u2019s 1st District and New York\u2019s 14th District are urban, majority-minority and safely Democratic. Clinton won 77 percent of the vote here in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s these districts that may prove most fruitful for progressive insurgents in the coming months of primaries. Beyond Bush\u2019s challenge to Clay, women of color hope to upset longtime incumbents in a district in Boston and in Delaware\u2019s Senate race. But each candidate will need to break decades-long strangleholds.\n\nSo many people in office are kind of Ivory Tower. [Ocasio-Cortez and Bush] are more of the people. Marilyn Vollet, who leads a progressive group, House of Truth\n\nBush\u2019s rally with Ocasio-Cortez, conveniently on Bush\u2019s birthday, was held at the Ready Room, a music venue in the city\u2019s hipster-filled Grove neighborhood. The 500-strong crowd was majority-white in a district that is 49 percent African-American, and for a political event, the crowd was remarkably young.\n\nFew of the attendees expressed real policy disagreements with Clay \u2015 several pointed to Bush\u2019s decision to reject corporate money, and one young woman noted Clay had recently sided with a developer in a dispute with the city of St. Louis. Mostly, they wanted a more activist approach from their representative \u2013 and more progressivism from the Democratic Party writ large.\n\n\u201cSo many people in office are kind of Ivory Tower,\u201d said Marilyn Vollet, who leads a progressive group called House of Truth. \u201c[Ocasio-Cortez and Bush] are more of the people.\u201d\n\nIn an interview after the rally, Bush took a similar angle.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of politicians were that way, were just being a corporate Democrat or someone who is not necessarily an activist. There was a group of politicians who didn\u2019t think that that was their role,\u201d she said when asked about Clay. \u201cWe have to have fighters in these positions. The community is under attack on all sides.\u201d\n\nLacy Clay didn\u2019t respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for an interview. His campaign has sent out mailers boasting of his support for Medicare for all and his ability to bring home the bacon, including landing a new western headquarters for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.\n\nBefore Bush took the stage, activist after activist \u2015 representing Latino immigrants, the disabled community, Palestinians and more \u2013 testified on her behalf, noting she frequently showed up at protests in her nurse\u2019s scrubs. (She also received an endorsement from Maxi Glamour, \u201cthe demon queen of polka and baklava.\u201d)\n\nState Rep. Bruce Franks, a fellow Ferguson activist who said he met Bush \u201cin tear gas and pepper spray,\u201d was the speaker who took the most direct aim at Clay, saying he was \u201cfrom a political dynasty\u201d and \u201cperpetuated the same bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about me having a big title,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThis is about you getting big change.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, meanwhile, stood as a reminder that the upset was possible.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-grassroots-money-democrats_us_5c39032fe4b0922a21d4e584": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2013 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the first major Democratic candidate to announce a challenge to President Donald Trump, had only been in Iowa for a few hours when she laid down a marker with implications for every other Democrat who might run for president in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe ought to be building a movement, and the way we do that is with lots of involvement from lots of people, not having billionaires buy these campaigns, whether we\u2019re talking about super PACs or self-funding,\u201d Warren told reporters after the first rally of her campaign, held in an event space attached to a bowling alley in this city on the Missouri River. \u201cAs Democrats, in a primary, we should lock arms and make sure this is the party of the people.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s call to disavow super PACs and self-funding, along with a growing movement within the Democratic Party to reject donations from Wall Street and business interests, is set to reshape how Democratic candidates bring in the millions of dollars necessary to power their primary campaigns. And it\u2019s a sign that the way dozens of 2020 candidates raise their cash will be just as important as how much they bring in and how they spend it.\n\nIt also represents a continuation of two trends from the 2018 elections. The first saw Democrats collect more than $1.2 billion in online, small-dollar donations via ActBlue. The second saw more than three-quarters of newly elected congressional Democrats pledge to say no to corporate PACs, which bundle donations from a business\u2019 employees and funnel them to elected officials. The performance of candidates like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) \u2014 who narrowly lost to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 established the political potency of swearing off super and corporate PACs, although not without some pushback.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to create a domino effect. Any outliers will stick out like a sore thumb. Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green\n\nWarren won\u2019t be the only candidate to discuss money in politics \u2014 expect almost every Democratic candidate to make it part of their stump speech, and for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock to place it at the center of his campaign if he runs \u2014 but Warren\u2019s early entry has given her a chance to set the terms of debate. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has long functioned as Warren\u2019s unofficial political arm, has already begun to pressure other candidates to agree to the senator\u2019s conditions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to create a domino effect,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of the PCCC. \u201cAny outliers will stick out like a sore thumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis challenge is a proxy for cleaning up the Democratic brand, having it be associated with the people, not big money interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt incentivizes Democratic Party politicians to associate with regular people when they\u2019re getting policy advice.\u201d\n\nEnd Citizens United, a political action committee that rallied congressional candidates to swear off corporate PAC donations, is hoping to convince Democratic candidates in 2020 to do the same. At an event in Washington, D.C., earlier this week, four freshly elected Democrats \u2013 Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Abigail Spanberger (Va.), Antonio Delegado (N.Y.) and Jared Golden (Maine) \u2013 said the argument helped them win over voters across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cThis should really be about powering their campaigns from the people,\u201d said Tiffany Mueller, the president of End Citizens United, which hosted the event. \u201cWe think they should not have single candidate super PACs.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats who are potential presidential candidates in 2020 have already promised to stop accepting corporate PAC donations, including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. But super PACs \u2015 which can raise unlimited sums, provided they don\u2019t coordinate with the candidate they\u2019re supporting \u2015 are more complicated: There\u2019s nothing a campaign can do to stop allies from creating and funding one.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren made her first stop of the 2018 campaign in Council Bluffs, Iowa.\n\nFighting A \u2018Caricature\u2019\n\nWarren\u2019s stance is already having an impact. Political operatives preparing super PACs for candidates, and the millionaires and billionaires getting ready to pay for their own campaigns, are adjusting to the new environment, preparing arguments that their money is cleaner than it looks at first glance.\n\n\u201cI think people have a caricature in mind of what they\u2019re criticizing,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a Democratic donor and operative who is preparing a super PAC to back Booker\u2019s bid for the presidency. Phillips said he envisioned thousands of donors contributing to a PAC to help organize voters of color, rather than a single billionaire keeping a candidate afloat with television ads, which was common in the GOP nomination fights of 2012 and 2016.\n\nPhillips, who previously funded and organized super PACs for President Barack Obama in 2008 and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in 2018, said his group\u2019s work to organize and register voters of colors in key states would help the progressive movement as a whole as much as aid Booker\u2019s bid for the presidency.\n\n\u201cI expect, frankly, there are going to be thousands of people, many of them professionals of color, who are supportive of Cory and want to give him more than $2,700,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we want to give them a vehicle, because we think he represents the best chance to reassemble the Obama coalition and bring back the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to care nearly as much about where the money is from as where the money is spent,\u201d he added.\n\nBooker is highly unlikely to be the only candidate with a super PAC backing him. In December, The New York Times reported that allies of both Gillibrand and Harris were discussing creating super PACs.\n\nSelf-Funders Shrug It Off\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, the first Democratic candidate to announce a run against Trump, is using his personal fortune to pay for his campaign.\n\nWarren\u2019s challenge is even more direct for candidates who are funding their own campaigns. Although billionaire donor and hedge fund founder Tom Steyer announced he wouldn\u2019t run for president on Wednesday, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is already running, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is widely seen as considering a bid. Both men have historically funded their own campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on running a campaign of ideas and would welcome a debate on the issues,\u201d said John Davis, a senior adviser to Delaney, who has already loaned his campaign $3.5 million. \u201cAlso, we happen to believe voters and not politicians should decide which candidates to nominate.\u201d\n\nBloomberg \u2015 who spent $100 million or more on his mayoral races \u2015 told reporters on Friday in Texas his wealth allowed him to make decisions without being beholden to donors, a common argument used by self-funders.\n\n\u201cI used only my own money so I didn\u2019t have to ask anybody what they wanted in return for a contribution,\u201d Bloomberg said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cAnd, if I ran again, I would do the same thing. I think not having to adjust what you say and what you work on based on who financed your campaign is one of the things that the public really likes.\u201d\n\nThe Small-Dollar Battle\n\nDemocrats have been arguing over how best to raise money since at least 2004, when campaign finance advocates attempted to get the candidates to agree on a spending limit. Howard Dean, who pioneered online fundraising, and John Kerry, who spent millions of his own cash, both tossed aside the pledge. In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made denunciations of super PACs set up to back Hillary Clinton a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nWarren and then-Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) reached an agreement, dubbed \u201cThe People\u2019s Pledge,\u201d during her 2012 race that essentially barred super PACs and other outside groups from spending in the contest. It\u2019s unclear if Warren will propose a similar pledge for the presidential contest.\n\nThis challenge is a proxy for cleaning up the Democratic brand, having it be associated with the people, not big money interests. Adam Green\n\nHer new call is somewhat self-serving. Warren is one of a select group of candidates or potential candidates \u2014 along with O\u2019Rourke and Sanders \u2014 with a demonstrated ability to raise mountains of small-dollar cash from online donors. (Harris, Gillibrand and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown also have large donor lists, but without the track record of the former three candidates.)\n\nThere is some risk in relying on $5 and $10 internet donations: Although Warren and other candidates have found it easy to bring in money against Republicans, donors might not be as eager to give when Democrats are competing against other Democrats, some operatives warned.\n\n\u201cOn their own, or one on one, a handful of candidates have the potential for incredible programs. But all against each other? In a crowded primary? No one knows if they\u2019ll be able to raise such massive sums online,\u201d said Greg Berlin, one of the founders of the Democratic digital firm Mothership Strategies. \u201cWill donors give to multiple candidates? Will they pick a horse? Will they shift support multiple times?\u201d\n\nIt is likely every candidate in the race will need to show at least some ability to bring in online donations. The Democratic National Committee has said eligibility for debates will be determined, in part, by \u201cgrassroots fundraising,\u201d though the terms remain vague.\n\nStill, some Democrats are worried about falling into a \u201cpurity battle where we don\u2019t know where it ends up,\u201d as Mueller, the End Citizens United president, put it. Almost every candidate in 2020 has taken cash from interest groups or PACs in the past and could open themselves up to charges of hypocrisy. Warren, for instance, has taken more than $1 million from union and ideological PACs over the course of her career. And her opponents will notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of amusing that Sen. Warren herself has been perfectly happy to take money from billionaires for her Senate campaign,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, shows no sign of letting up on her message. She mentioned it at every stop of her three-day sojourn across Iowa, and is expected to do the same when she campaigns in New Hampshire on Saturday. On Wednesday afternoon, her campaign sent out a list-building email on the topic.

It\u2019s not just about NJ, this is about the country. Do your job. \u2014 Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) December 22, 2018\n\nKhanna co-sponsored bipartisan legislation in February to have the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis study \u201cthe effects of broadband [internet] on the economy\u201d with the goal of expanding high-speed internet access to underserved areas, most of which are rural.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, co-sponsored the legislation on the Senate side where it passed unanimously last week.\n\nKhanna told HuffPost that he approached Pallone, the chairman-designate of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the legislation, to see whether Pallone would be willing to take up the bill in committee.\n\nPallone implied that he could not because it had not gone through the right procedural channels, according to Khanna.\n\nKhanna then heard from people familiar with the conversation that Pallone\u2019s staff had told Senate staff that he \u201cdoes not move Khanna bills.\u201d\n\nKhanna suspects that the reason Pallone allegedly has a grudge against him is because he was one of the first members of Congress to endorse New York Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s call for the creation of a special committee tasked with drafting \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d legislation.\n\nPallone, whose committee would ordinarily deal with climate change legislation, has opposed the committee\u2019s creation.\n\nA spokesperson for Pallone did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nBut Khanna\u2019s decision to air his grievance publicly reflects a growing boldness on the part of younger, largely progressive members of Congress to eschew norms of deference to party leaders in favor of transparency.\n\n\u201cThis speaks to a bigger concern, which is the power of committee chairs to block legislation from going to the floor and the need for greater transparency in the process,\u201d Khanna said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is among those new members who have used social media to shine a light on heretofore private aspects of influence peddling in Congress, such as the presence of undisclosed lobbyists at a Harvard-sponsored orientation for new lawmakers.\n\nKhanna, a two-term congressman from Silicon Valley and vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, conceded that the freshman class\u2019 boldness might be rubbing off on slightly more seasoned members.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given us some courage,\u201d he said.\n\nKhanna insisted that he did not take the decision to go public lightly. He never spoke up about previous off-putting interactions with Pallone, including an incident in Khanna\u2019s first term when Pallone publicly objected to cooperating with Khanna on the drafting of an internet bill of rights.\n\nKhanna also witnessed Pallone mocking the direct action tactics of the young Sunrise Movement protesters who had inundated Capitol Hill to press for a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cHe was laughing about it in the elevator,\u201d Khanna recalled. \u201cIt was very condescending.\u201d\n\nPallone, who has represented a dense stretch of central New Jersey since 1989, is a member of Democrats\u2019 Steering and Policy Committee, which is responsible for deciding committee assignments. That gives him some ammunition with which to retaliate against Khanna, who is seeking a spot on the Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax and spending policies.\n\nBut Pallone also represents one of the districts with the highest concentrations of Indian-Americans in the country. Khanna, one of a handful of Indian-Americans in the House, is a something of a celebrity in Indian-American communities \u2015 even on the East Coast.\n\nKhanna, who unseated incumbent Rep. Mike Honda (D) in a 2016 primary, has quickly become one of the most outspoken and prolific progressive House members. In June, he elicited criticism from fellow Democrats for issuing a dual endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Joseph Crowley, the incumbent she ultimately unseated. Ocasio-Cortez has praised him for being the only member of Congress to back her bid.\n\nBut Khanna has stuck his neck out on policy too. It\u2019s what prompted The Nation\u2019s John Nichols to name him the \u201cmost valuable House member\u201d in a Thursday rundown of the 2018 \u201cprogressive honor roll.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Khanna has introduced legislation to force an end to the United States\u2019 participation in the war in Yemen. He also co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) targeting Amazon\u2019s mistreatment of its low-wage workers; Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos responded to the public pressure campaign by raising warehouse workers\u2019 pay to $15 an hour.\n\nKhanna has even gotten President Donald Trump to sign two bills he introduced. Trump signed a bill Thursday that Khanna co-sponsored requiring federal agencies to modernize their websites.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressional-progressive-caucus-more-influential-pramila-jayapal_us_5bfd8d84e4b0771fb6bee520": "Aaron Bernstein / Reuters Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) speaks about revelations about President Donald Trump's involvement with Russia on Capitol Hill on May 17, 2017.\n\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has historically lacked the clout of other values-based congressional factions, is making a serious play for influence in the next Congress.\n\nIn the recent midterm elections, the caucus\u2019 political action committee spent more than three times what it spent in the previous election cycle.\n\nThe money paid off. The CPC is on track to pick up 19 more members: 25 people from the incoming freshman class and two incumbents \u2015 California Reps. Jimmy Panetta and Brad Sherman. Eight of its current members are retiring.\n\nThat would bring the caucus\u2019 total to 96 members, or about 40 percent of the House Democratic Caucus \u2015 by far the largest bloc in the party.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the centrist-heavy rebellion against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership has strengthened the CPC\u2019s bargaining hand. Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.), the caucus\u2019 co-chairs, leveraged their endorsement of Pelosi for the promise of proportional representation on five key House committees where their presence is currently lacking: Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Financial Services, Appropriations, and Intelligence.\n\nBut the CPC faces significant challenges to becoming as powerful as the House Freedom Caucus, whose far-right members virtually dictated House Republicans\u2019 agenda during the last Congress by operating as a bloc willing to exercise veto power if leadership did not meet its hardline demands. Those tactics make some progressives uncomfortable, and the CPC remains far more ideologically diverse than the Freedom Caucus was.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) addresses reporters on Nov. 15, 2018. In exchange for CPC support, Pelosi agreed to provide more committee seats.\n\nFrom \u2018Doormats\u2019 To Dominance?\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret that many CPC members have questionable progressive bona fides, particularly members like Reps. Lisa Blunt Rochester (Del.), Don Beyer (Va.), Val Demings (Fla.) and Darren Soto (Fla.), who also belong to the CPC\u2019s business-friendly rival, the New Democrat Coalition. And even Rep. Joseph Kennedy (Mass.), a CPC member who is not a New Democrat, has yet to sign on to the Medicare for all legislation backed by a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nCPC leadership plans to stick with a big-tent approach, arguing that it provides it the resources to shape policy debates within the caucus through internal lobbying. Needless to say, the CPC is not interested in joining New York Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s call to primary insufficiently progressive Democrats.\n\nAt the same time, committed progressives like Ocasio-Cortez would be free to form smaller, ad-hoc groups of like-minded lawmakers capable of engaging in Freedom Caucus-style legislative hardball if Democratic leadership crosses one of their perceived red lines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great opportunity for an unofficial \u2018harder-line\u2019 caucus,\u201d said Alex Lawson, executive director of the progressive nonprofit Social Security Works and a leading figure in efforts to land CPC members spots on key committees.\n\nThis election will not mean much if Wall Street\u2019s representatives in the Democratic Party control all of the committees that matter. Alex Lawson, Social Security Works\n\nJayapal, who replaces Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.) as CPC co-chair, also founded a separate Medicare for All PAC to support candidates who back single-payer health care and plans to make it a major force inside the party ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nShe pointed out that it is easier to operate as a bloc when the goal, as it is for the Freedom Caucus, is simply thwarting anything deemed insufficiently conservative. Progressives who have ambitious ideas about expanding the federal government\u2019s role in public life need to build coalitions to advance their agenda, so a similar approach is not as useful, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Freedom Caucus is the caucus of \u2018no.\u2019 We\u2019re the caucus of \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThanks to the leftward shift of the progressive base on economic policy in recent years, the center of gravity has shifted in the House Democratic Caucus in general, and in the CPC in particular. For example, Pelosi, a co-founder of the CPC once on the liberal vanguard, is now far from one of the Democratic caucus\u2019 most left-leaning members. Indeed, on matters like single-payer health care and \u201cpaygo,\u201d a rule she backs requiring additional revenue or equivalent spending cuts to pay for any new spending, she is at odds with CPC leaders.\n\nAlexander Drago / Reuters Some progressives see the House Freedom Caucus, chaired by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), as a model for wielding power, but CPC co-chairs do not plan to emulate his tactics.\n\nMatt Stoller, who worked for former progressive Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2015 the latter of whom also co-founded the CPC in 1991 \u2015 said CPC members were widely viewed as \u201cdoormats\u201d during the previous period of Democratic House control from 2007 to 2011. He witnessed the caucus\u2019 impotence firsthand in 2009, when it failed to stop junior Democrats on the Financial Services Committee from joining Republicans to pass an amendment exempting car dealerships from the oversight of a new consumer protection agency. Among other abusive practices, auto dealerships are known to discriminate against nonwhite buyers.\n\nStoller, who was fighting the amendment\u2019s approval, flagged the bad vote for the national media. But it was a lonely quest, he recalled.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of staffers doing\u201d similar work, he said.\n\nStoller warns against putting too much stock in the extortion-fueled tactics of the Freedom Caucus, which he called \u201csexy,\u201d but less relevant than the more mundane work of internal wrangling. That\u2019s likely to take the form of the caucus making its policy case to fellow members of Congress and horse trading for deals, or else leveraging the media and outside activists to exert pressure on wayward Democrats.\n\nJim Young / Reuters Former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank's landmark Wall Street reform bill was watered down by centrist Democrats on the Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe \u2018Money\u2019 Committees\n\nSecuring seats on the House\u2019s most influential committees, sometimes nicknamed the \u201cmoney\u201d committees, was a high priority for progressive activists eager to avoid more defeats. The most transformative, long-term priorities championed by progressives must pass through those committees whether it\u2019s a Green New Deal, which would go through Energy and Commerce, or single-payer health care, which would likely be under the jurisdiction of both Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means.\n\nCentrist Democrats, who are more likely to have business backgrounds, have historically had a disproportionate presence on the influential committees. That has made them targets for corporate campaign money, which they are less conflicted about accepting, and put progressives at a disadvantage when it comes to shaping economic policy.\n\n\u201cThis election will not mean much if Wall Street\u2019s representatives in the Democratic Party control all of the committees that matter: Ways and Means; Energy and Commerce; and Financial Services,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nBut while Jayapal is already touting the CPC\u2019s success in this respect, having secured a formal commitment from Pelosi, the caucus still has its work cut out for it.\n\nThe Intercept reported on Wednesday that some veteran progressives are reluctant to volunteer for seats on four of the five committees where progressives are seeking proportional representation, since, under present rules, doing so would require them to vacate other committees where they have burnished a niche or developed seniority.\n\nMembers of the Committees on Ways and Means; Energy and Commerce; Financial Services; and Appropriations are barred from serving on a second committee unless they receive a waiver from House leadership. (Members of the governing Rules Committee must also get a waiver to serve on other committees, though that is not a panel that the CPC has prioritized.)\n\nWithout such a waiver, Jayapal, an outspoken immigration rights leader would have to leave both the Budget and Judiciary Committees to occupy a seat on one of the four exclusive panels. Her spokesman Vedant Patel declined to make any firm pronouncements about her plans in a follow-up exchange with HuffPost, saying she\u2019d decide closer to the start of the new Congress.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (Calif.), a CPC vice chair, said the success of the effort to secure CPC seats on the \u201cmoney\u201d committees would likely hinge on Democratic leadership\u2019s willingness to distribute waivers.\n\nThe tax and spending-focused Ways and Means Committee might be a natural fit for Khanna, who has introduced legislation with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) that would dramatically increase the Earned Income Tax Credit for low- and middle-income families. But he would also strongly prefer to remain on the Armed Services Committee, where he has used his perch to advocate ending U.S. support of the Saudi Arabian war in Yemen.\n\nHaving Barbara Lee in leadership will do a lot to ensure that we see the bold agenda that the progressive movement, black women, and all Americans deserve. Ady Barkan\n\nWaivers are only granted under rare circumstances, some Capitol Hill insiders maintain.\n\nBut 37 members of the current Congress have received the requisite permission to serve on more than one committee, including 20 Democrats, according to a list obtained by HuffPost.\n\nA source close to Democratic leadership would not say whether party chiefs are willing to give out more waivers in the interest of meeting a commitment to the CPC. The process of distributing waivers is still weeks away, since freshman lawmakers have yet to receive committee assignments, according to the source.\n\nFreshman Democrats offer another pool of potential recruits to powerful committees. Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib, a Justice Democrats-backed firebrand from Detroit, has her sights set on the Appropriations Committee, her chief of staff Ryan Anderson confirmed.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is reportedly seeking a spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee, according to Democratic sources who spoke to Politico; her spokesman would not confirm her interest.\n\nA spokeswoman for Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) would not say whether she wants to serve on one of the five powerful panels, or if she has a different preference.\n\nA spokesman for Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar (Minn.) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) questions Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Capitol Hill on May 24, 2017.\n\nHouse Democratic Leadership And Shaping Policy Priorities\n\nHaving diminished the ranks of her would-be challengers, Pelosi is now favored to reprise her reign as House Speaker when Congress reconvenes in January. The CPC\u2019s support for her ascent secured it important political capital at a time when a motley group of moderates is seeking to unseat her, or, in the case of some members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, undermine her power.\n\nNow progressives on and off Capitol Hill have their sights set on other positions in party leadership, which the Democratic caucus will vote on on Wednesday morning. Chief among them is the post of caucus chair, where Rep. Barbara Lee (Calif.) is a favored contender. Lee is competing with New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is also in the CPC. But Lee, whose lone vote against the post-September 11 bill authorizing war in Afghanistan sealed her place in the progressive pantheon, is backed by the CPC co-chairs, as well as a host of liberal and women\u2019s groups. She would be the first black woman in the leadership of either party.\n\nAdy Barkan, a progressive activist with ALS who has traversed the country campaigning for Democratic candidates and causes, is spearheading an outside campaign in support of Lee\u2019s bid \u2015 complete with its own website.\n\n\u201cHaving Barbara Lee in leadership will do a lot to ensure that we see the bold agenda that the progressive movement, black women, and all Americans deserve,\u201d Barkan said.\n\nIn other, lower-profile leadership contests there is an even starker choice between progressive and centrist contenders. Progressive Rep. Katherine Clark (Mass.) is facing off against Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), a member of the New Democrat Coalition, for the job of caucus vice chair. And Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), a CPC member, is battling Rep. Terri Sewell (Ala.), another New Democrat, for a leadership spot reserved for newer members of Congress.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) walks with a reporter on Capitol Hill on Nov. 15, 2018. Tlaib is seeking a spot on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe House speaker and his or her deputies dictate the House\u2019s policy agenda, determining what bills committee chairs prioritize and bring to the floor for a vote.\n\nMost Democratic legislative priorities are almost certainly dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate, to say nothing of President Donald Trump\u2019s desk, but they provide an opportunity for the party to present an alternative governing vision to the public.\n\nDemocratic leaders have already vowed that the first bill they take up will be a far-reaching suite of anti-corruption and electoral reforms. The legislation has broad support in the Democratic caucus.\n\nCrafting health care policy, however, could test the CPC\u2019s strength within the Democratic caucus. The House is likely to take up legislation empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which would save the federal government and Medicare beneficiaries hundreds of billions of dollars over a 10-year period.\n\nProgressives hope to pass a bill at least as strong as the legislation introduced by CPC member Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) in July. Doggett\u2019s bill would allow bulk price negotiation but also enable the government to open up patented drugs to competition if it cannot agree on a lower price with a drug maker.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/julian-castro-president-2020-obama-housing_us_5c17e52ae4b030ed3ed01bc7": "SAN ANTONIO \u2015 Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro officially announced a run for the White House on Saturday, becoming one of the first fully committed candidates in what is expected to become a crowded contest for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cSo many journeys for me and my family have started right here,\u201d Castro told a crowd at Guadalupe Plaza on San Antonio\u2019s west side, blocks from the home where he grew up and the church where he was baptized. \u201cToday we begin another one.\u201d\n\nHe then rattled off a list of campaign pledges that planted him squarely within the rising progressive side of the Democratic Party. He reaffirmed his rejection of corporate PAC money and support for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d called for bail reform and promised that his first executive action would be to rejoin the Paris climate accord.\n\n\u201cThere is a crisis today,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis of leadership. President Trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation.\u201d\n\nCastro, 44, has long showed signs of high political ambitions, but was not known for staking out controversial positions until he launched his presidential exploratory committee last month. Since then, he has struck a markedly more left-wing tone, and his speech Saturday repeatedly hit upon progressive themes.\n\nHe attacked President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, highlighting the White House\u2019s six-week experiment with systematically splitting parents from their children at the border.\n\n\u201cYeah, we have to have border security,\u201d Castro said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a smart and a humane way to do it. And there is no way in hell that taking babies is a smart or humane way to do it.\u201d\n\nCastro also delved into the issue of race, casting prominent police killings of people of color as symptomatic of America\u2019s wider problems with racial discrimination.\n\n\u201cFor far too many people of color, any interaction with the police can become fatal,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIf police in Charleston can arrest Dylann Roof after he murdered nine people worshipping at Bible study without hurting him, don\u2019t tell me that Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Aiyana Jones, Eric Garner, Jason Pero, Stephon Clark and Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t still be alive today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep saying Black Lives Matter,\u201d the candidate added.\n\nCastro rose to national prominence in 2012 when the then-mayor was selected to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. He joined the Obama administration as the head of HUD two years later, giving him a national profile and feeding speculation that he might become the running mate of his party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee. (Hillary Clinton ultimately chose Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia instead.)\n\nOver the last two years, however, Castro\u2019s star has waned, as he stayed out of electoral politics while former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke ran an underdog campaign that brought Texas Democrats within striking distance of winning statewide office for the first time in two decades.\n\nInstead, Castro played a quieter role behind the scenes, supporting dozens of young and progressive candidates around the country through his political action committee Opportunity First.\n\n\u201cHe crisscrossed the country in support of candidates,\u201d Latino Victory Fund Director Crist\u00f3bal Alex told HuffPost. \u201cHe was one of the most sought-after Latino surrogates in the country.\u201d\n\nCastro had already indicated his intentions to run, making a trip to Iowa in August ahead of the midterm elections, releasing a memoir in October and launching an exploratory committee in December, which gave him the legal ability to begin raising campaign money.\n\nIn a video announcing the exploratory committee last month, he highlighted the importance of good health care, education and a clean environment. He also stressed the value of hard work, which he said he and his twin brother, Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro (D-Texas), learned from their immigrant grandmother and their single mother.\n\n\u201cShe taught my brother and me that if you want to make a change in your life, in your community, you don\u2019t wait, you work,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro said of his mother in the video. \u201cSo I\u2019m taking a lesson from my mother \u2014 if we want to see a change in this country, we don\u2019t wait. We work. We make our future happen.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Castro will likely face off against Massachusetts Sen.

But the announcement seemed to signal an end to weeks of protests and political bird-dogging by activists who had quickly garnered support for a resolution establishing a Green New Deal select committee from more than 40 incoming or sitting House Democrats and nearly a half-dozen senators, including three likely presidential contenders.\n\nIn that, the congresswoman-elect from New York can claim victory.\n\nThe push forced a sea change in climate politics, pushing the policy debate from stagnant, wonky and dubious solutions centered on market tweaks to sweeping, dramatic policies that scientists say could actually make a dent in surging greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFor years, the Republican Party\u2019s unabashed embrace of the oil, gas and coal industries established its outright denial of the near-universally accepted science that burning fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change.\n\nThat freed the Democratic Party, beholden to its own donors in the industry, to take a wishy-washy stance, righteously assuming the mantle of \u201cthe party that believes in science\u201d without having to advocate for policies that would seriously affect deep-pocketed interests.\n\nIn 2009, when Barack Obama was president and the party controlled both houses of Congress, Democrats\u2019 big legislative push on climate was a cap-and-trade bill, a relatively conservative greenhouse gas policy first devised by Republican economists.\n\nWhen the bill failed in the Senate \u2015 reportedly because the White House urged party leaders to prioritize health care reform and retreat \u2015 Democrats went adrift on the issue. Climate change barely came up during the 2016 presidential election, despite huge difference between the Democratic primary opponents and a gaping chasm between nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who dismisses climate change as \u201ca hoax.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS electricians Adam Hall, right, and Steven Gabert, install solar panels on a roof for Arizona Public Service company in Goodyear, Arizona.\n\nTrump\u2019s election during one of the hottest years on record helped ignite a new political fury over runaway greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive rollback of regulations to curb climate change and decision to install fossil fuel executives and industry allies in key environmental posts hardened the Republican Party\u2019s stance on the issue and gave Democrats an easy avatar around which to rally.\n\nIll-fated proposals to deal with climate change started to roll in.\n\nIn April 2017, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) introduced a bill to effectively end fossil fuel use by 2050. In July of that year, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) proposed a carbon tax bill alongside companion legislation by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and David Cicilline (D-R.I.).\n\nThe following September, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) introduced the Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act, mandating 100 percent renewable energy throughout the country by 2035, ending all subsidies to drilling, mining and refining companies, and providing funding to workers to transition into new industries.\n\nYet by early 2018, the party had failed to rally around any of the legislation, even ignoring climate change altogether in the party\u2019s State of the Union rebuttals in January.\n\nThen came Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn June, the avowed democratic socialist won a shocking primary victory against Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), one of the most senior Democrats in the House and a powerful deputy of Pelosi. Her campaign platform called for a Green New Deal, at the time described vaguely as 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 and 1940s-style economy-wide mobilization. It was essentially a clarion call to go to war against fossil fuel emissions.\n\nAdding to the urgency of her plan was the report in October from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found that, to avoid cataclysmic warming beyond 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit, world governments needed to halve global emissions in just 12 years. When the Democratic National Committee\u2019s decision to backtrack on a ban on fossil-fuel corporate donations in August, the party\u2019s rift on climate change became apparent.\n\nThe 28-year-old former bartender from the Bronx became an overnight celebrity. She cultivated allies.\n\nReed Saxon/ASSOCIATED PRESS A Spanish-style home is consumed by wildfire flames on Dume Drive in Malibu, California, in November.\n\nBy the time Ocasio-Cortez cruised to an easy victory in the Nov. 6 general election, roughly half a dozen other insurgent Democrats who won were campaigning on a Green New Deal.\n\nTheir campaigns served as rallying points for the Sunrise Movement, a progressive climate justice group focused on young people. After Pelosi made it clear that Democrats\u2019 primary plan to address climate change was to revive a defunct select committee to study the issue, the group \u2015 buttressed by the left-wing group Justice Democrats \u2015 planned sit-ins in the party leader\u2019s office.\n\nLate Thursday, the Sunrise Movement vowed to continue pushing for a Green New Deal committee.\n\nEvan Weber, the Sunrise Movement\u2019s political director, said in a statement: \u201cNancy Pelosi has the power to determine whether or not the Select Committee for a Green New Deal lives or dies. Sunrise Movement\u2019s position is and will continue to be that it\u2019s not over until she makes it clear that it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez joined the demonstration, garnering headlines and astounding a Washington establishment accustomed to new lawmakers who politely pay dues to the party elders. To streamline the effort around a specific goal, she produced a draft resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal \u2015 a counter-proposal to the Pelosi plan.\n\nAs it picked up support from dozens of Democrats, it seemed likely at one point to come to fruition. But by this week, it became clear Pelosi and her allies were putting up roadblocks, stripping the hypothetical select committee of subpoena and legislative powers. On Thursday, Pelosi\u2019s decision to tap Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) to lead the restored select committee on climate change confirmed the Green New Deal resolution\u2019s demise.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what comes next. Last Friday, more than 300 state and local officials announced their support for a Green New Deal in a widely publicized open letter. Hours later, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) became the third likely 2020 presidential contender to offer his full-throated support for the Green New Deal. On Monday, a new poll showed an eye-popping 81 percent of registered voters supported the policies outlined under the Green New Deal resolution \u2015 including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. So the direction is apparent.\n\nJust ask Castor.\n\n\u201cThe Green New Deal is full of very promising ideas and passion and energy,\u201d she told HuffPost on Thursday evening. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to breathe life into a select committee on the climate crisis.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-congress-obamacare-win-midterms_us_5bdc9b23e4b04367a87c7a5b": "Republicans fought the health care law and the health care law won.\n\nIt was a close call, closer perhaps than many people realized. Had Republicans kept control of Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections, they would almost certainly have made another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If anything, the result might have emboldened them, by convincing them that they could survive the kind of political backlash that their failed 2017 effort produced.\n\nBut as of Tuesday evening, Republicans were set to lose their majority in the House of Representatives, with only the size of a new Democratic majority in question. And health care was a big reason why Republicans performed as badly as they did.\n\nThis was an election about immigration and the environment, Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump, but voters consistently told pollsters that health care was foremost on their minds.\n\nAnd it was the GOP\u2019s repeal effort specifically that ended up causing the party so many problems, in no small part because Democrats did everything they could to make it an issue. In district after district, state after state, Republicans came under withering attack for trying to take away Medicaid and, especially, for trying to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRepublicans tried to change the subject and, when that wouldn\u2019t work, they decided their best strategy was to lie \u2015 to pretend they hadn\u2019t spent eight years trying to strip away those pre-existing condition protections and the rest of the Affordable Care Act with it.\n\nThose arguments may have helped some Republican Senate candidates win close races. But they didn\u2019t save the GOP\u2019s House majority, which means the health care law has all but surely survived yet another near-death experience \u2015 the latest in a string of trials that includes the Democrats losing their filibuster-proof Senate majority in 2010, a pair of Supreme Court cases in 2012 and 2015, the failed launch of the online insurance markets in 2013, and most recently the GOP repeal effort of 2017.\n\nIn fact, the most immediate, practical consequence of the election could be something quite the opposite of repeal. A few hundred thousand more people could get health insurance through Medicaid, because states that had resisted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of the program could finally be joining.\n\nBallot initiatives to expand the program, as 33 states plus the District of Columbia have already done, won in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah Tuesday. A measure to renew an existing expansion program in another conservative state, Montana, failed.\n\nMedicaid expansion could also come to one other traditionally conservative state, Kansas. The state legislature approved legislation to expand the program last year, only to have then-Gov. Sam Brownback (R) veto it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Kris Kobach lost his gubernatorial bid to Democrat Laura Kelly. She has pledged to approve an expansion bill within her first year of office.\n\nRepublicans Haven\u2019t Given Up \u2015 And May Never Give Up\n\nDespite these results, nobody familiar with the history of the 2010 law, or health care policy more generally, would assume that fights over the program are over \u2015 or that it is sure to be standing a few years from now.\n\nA lawsuit from 20 Republican state officials claiming that the law is unconstitutional now sits before a federal judge in Texas. The merits of the case are weak, as even longtime Affordable Care Act critics concede. But it\u2019s entirely possible it will prevail, setting up future appeals and perhaps injecting yet more chaos into insurance markets, because the judge is a conservative Republican appointee and the lawsuit has the backing of Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual move. Typically the Justice Department would defend a federal law, even if the administration in power doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nBut the decision to join was just one example of the ways the Trump administration has found to use executive authority to undermine the law, something it will continue to do as long as it controls the executive branch. While the state officials are seeking to get the entire law thrown out, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the judge to only invalidate the provisions of the law protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJust last month, the Trump administration announced it would be proposing new regulations that would give states leeway to rewrite the rules of their own insurance markets, by scaling back the regulations on pre-existing conditions and even allocating financial assistance differently. This was the administration\u2019s latest move to weaken the Affordable Care Act\u2019s consumer protections. Trump\u2019s government also severely cut back on health insurance exchange outreach and enrollment programs.\n\nThe Trump administration and Republican-led states will be able to continue such efforts and to impose restrictions on Medicaid eligibility. The administration already has approved plans in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire and Wisconsin that impose work requirements on some adult Medicaid beneficiaries (although a court struck down Kentucky\u2019s plan). Nine other states have applied for work requirements the administration is almost certain to okay.\n\nThe reality is that Republicans will never stop trying to weaken, undermine and ultimately eliminate the Affordable Care Act, just as they have never given up on trying to privatize Medicare and dramatically cut Medicaid.\n\nBut the Medicare example is instructive, because it shows what happens when a program has become too popular to dislodge. Republicans portray themselves as defenders of Medicare, even as they are trying to scale back and transform it into a private program, because they know that a frontal, unambiguous political assault would invite such a strong popular backlash.\n\nThis election may signal that the Affordable Care Act has reached the same threshold or is at least getting a lot closer. The program still isn\u2019t as popular, with polls showing that only small majorities have favorable views of it, but that\u2019s an improvement over what the same polls showed just two years ago.\n\nIt may be that by trying to repeal the health care law, the law\u2019s critics have done what it never could do on its own: shore up support not just for the law\u2019s specific provisions, but for the very idea that people should get health care even if they are sick and even if they can\u2019t pay for that care on their own.\n\nNot that the Affordable Care Act has actually realized that goal. The number of people without health insurance is at historic lows, but many millions still have no coverage and even among those with insurance, many millions are struggling to pay their bills.\n\nSome are in trouble because they make too much money to qualify for financial assistance and the comprehensive insurance sold under Affordable Care Act regulations, with its guarantees of benefits for all, is too expensive for them to afford on their own.\n\nOthers are in trouble because they have employer-sponsored coverage and the out-of-pocket costs keep getting higher. This isn\u2019t a problem that Obamacare created so much as one it didn\u2019t solve: Health care still costs more in America than it does in any other country.\n\nWhere Democrats Might Go From Here\n\nNow that Democrats control congressional committees, one of their main focuses will be using subpoena power to oversee, and investigate, how the Trump administration is managing federal health programs.\n\nLikely topics for investigation include the Trump administration\u2019s decisions to cut that outreach spending; to allow states so much leeway in rewriting their insurance market rules; and to grant requests for work requirements and other limitations on Medicaid coverage. Some of these choices involved questionable uses of executive authority and that is precisely the sort of thing Democratic congressional committees would want to scrutinize.\n\nBut there\u2019s a presidential election coming in two years and, at least within the Democratic Party, this campaign is likely to feature a conversation that started in the last one \u2015 when Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, made his proposal for a single-payer, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSince that time, more than a dozen Democratic senators, including many presidential hopefuls, have endorsed the idea. Some of them have joined colleagues in promoting alternative plans that also envision large expansions of government-run insurance, along with government control over health care prices, but would not change the system as radically as would the Sanders plan.\n\nThe common element in these ideas is an effort to complete the party\u2019s work, from enactment of Medicare up through the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, to make sure everybody can get health care.\n\nWhether they settle eventually on something that could be called Medicare for All or opt for a more modest approach that includes some mix of more subsidies, government control over prices and new government-run insurance programs, a Democratic House could be the proving ground for these ideas and the place where the party will have to coalesce about what to do next.\n\nRepublicans will be part of this debate, too. During the final weeks of the 2018 campaign, Republicans tried to make Medicare for All a big issue \u2015 insisting that all Democrats supported it and then insisting it would destroy American health care, and Medicare itself in particular. Those attacks might resonate more in the coming months or coming years. They might not.\n\nEither way, they don\u2019t give Republicans what they have always lacked and apparently still lack: a conservative health care plan that would result in health care for more people, not fewer. And the American public seems to grasp that, even though health care is such an infamously confusing subject.\n\nIt goes a long way to explaining why Trump and his Republicans aren\u2019t claiming victory after Tuesday night, and why millions of people who have gotten health care through the Affordable Care Act will get to keep it \u2015 at least for now.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect the final result of a ballot initiative in Montana to retain the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-afghanistan-war_us_5be0d48ae4b01ffb1d054f8c": "WASHINGTON \u2015 As Democrats plan for a potential future in which they have control of the U.S. House, lawmakers, candidates and outside groups close to the party are quietly preparing a new push against the overlooked war in Afghanistan.\n\nThe last time the party controlled the lower chamber of Congress, the U.S. had close to 50,000 troops in Afghanistan. Today that number is 15,000 \u2014 but it\u2019s been eight years, and there\u2019s still no clarity about when the longest war in American history will actually come to an end. President Donald Trump\u2019s stated policy is that the U.S. presence has no time limit.\n\nSo Democrats are considering long-discussed proposals to torpedo the war\u2019s entire legal justification \u2014 the sweeping post-9/11 congressional authorization that has been used to support U.S. military action well beyond Afghan borders \u2014 and tie funding for the campaign to clearly outlined strategic goals and troop reductions. There\u2019s also talk of using new oversight powers to hold top officials, military commanders, defense contractors and foreign partners accountable for accusations of human rights violations, corruption and political posturing at the cost of human lives. And while party leaders are loath to commit to a particular course, they feel certain this is an issue their colleagues and their political base see as a priority.\n\nA dramatic but now largely forgotten vote in June 2017 underscored why this is a natural fight for Democrats. House Appropriations Committee lawmakers from both parties voted for the first time for a measure long pushed by war critic Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) that would repeal the authorization. GOP leadership quashed the effort, but it clearly signaled that, after years of worrying about being seen as too dovish, Democrats have reached a moment when even the other party and its voters can seriously consider serious antiwar action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way\u2026 from just one vote in opposition [when the authorization came up in 2001] to a widespread recognition among members of Congress that this was an overly-broad authorization that set the stage for perpetual war,\u201d Lee wrote in an email to HuffPost. She sees Democratic unity on the issue today: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of common ground across the caucus around holding this debate and vote.\u201d\n\nReuters Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) pushed to revisit the war authorization last year and is set to push again against military actions in Afghanistan and Yemen.\n\nOutside figures in frequent contact with leading Democrats concur. \u201cEnding the war in Afghanistan is not actually a fringe position in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Kate Kizer of the progressive organization Win Without War. Ned Price, a former CIA official who worked for President Barack Obama and now helps run a group called National Security Action, agreed, noting that any divide is more on how to change course without breeding instability than the question of whether it\u2019s time to do so.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the debate will be easy. It will pit lawmakers content with the status quo against figures formerly seen as fringe and vocal new colleagues critical of the Democratic political machine \u2014 many of whom fault Obama for ultimately abandoning his goal of bringing home the last U.S. troops from Afghanistan. And it will involve balancing lawmakers\u2019 divergent priorities, from campaign finance reform to health care. The hope among its proponents is that the energy \u2015 of new candidates, of resistance to Trump, of dissatisfaction with current politics \u2015 is on their side.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the new members who are coming into Congress, many of these folks, as well as a good proportion of the American public, were all preteens when this war started,\u201d Kizer said. \u201cSo I think as the war continued, there\u2019s a real question of, what are we doing?\u201d\n\nIf you look at the new members who are coming into Congress, many of these folks, as well as a good proportion of the American public, were all preteens when this war started. Kate Kizer, Win Without War\n\nAny debate will be informed by the well-documented failures of American plans to reform Afghanistan and develop a government and security structure that can prevent it from again becoming a playground for violent groups that might target the U.S. The Afghan government now controls only slightly more than half the country, a congressionally mandated inspector general reported on Nov. 1 \u2015 the lowest level since the watchdog began its tracking. The rest of the nation is under the sway of the Taliban, the hard-line group the U.S. deposed, and other organizations like the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI have long been a proponent of a negotiated, diplomatic solution to the war in Afghanistan and for an end to this war period. Unfortunately, the war in Afghanistan has gotten us further \u2015 not closer \u2015 to achieving those goals,\u201d wrote Lee, who\u2019s expected to take on a new House leadership role in the next Congress.\n\nFrom War Vote To Peace Bills\n\nLee began confronting the prospect of endless war three days after the attacks of 9/11.\n\nDemocrats have since then tried to challenge the legal justifications for wars in the House and Senate, pressure the executive branch \u2015 including Obama \u2015 with votes against war funding and highlighted wastes of taxpayer money and other failures in implicit bids to call the whole endeavor into question. They have occasionally won Republican cooperation, but, in nearly every instance, Congress has tacitly blessed Pentagon-led requests for troop increases.\n\nWhat\u2019s different now is that years of worsening fighting on the ground make it harder to argue that the final Obama strategy continued by Trump \u2015 of keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan while officially saying that they\u2019re not engaged in combat and that peace is possible \u2015 is working. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s own rhetoric questioning foreign policy orthodoxies and divides with his party on issues like trade and U.S. alliances have made it easier for lawmakers and outside groups to consider national security shifts that might have been taboo before January 2017.\n\n\u201cThe menu of options hasn\u2019t changed much in the past 10 years,\u201d said Shamila Chaudhary, a Johns Hopkins University analyst who served in the White House under Obama, noting that Democrats and Republicans have both spent years worrying about what might happen in Afghanistan without a U.S. presence.\n\nBut it\u2019s easier to make different choices from that menu.\n\nWith the Trump administration pushing a new high-level attempt at talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Taliban movement while simultaneously ramping up troop numbers, Democrats can lead congressional pressure for actual progress toward a negotiated peace, Lee wrote.\n\nFormer Obama advisers are already supporting the effort by pointing to their own success in small-scale engagement with the militant group \u2015 helping make clear that the approach is hardly a Trump innovation.\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), who will chair the House Armed Services committee if the Democrats take the House, is expected to use hearings and expanded powers to scrutinize Pentagon arguments.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s reluctance to talk about human rights issues leaves the field to Democrats to highlight problems like Afghan military abuses and support for warlords, Chaudhury said, bolstering their general case for an ultimate end to the conflict.\n\nWith soldiers now enlisting who weren\u2019t even alive when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, the years-long mushrooming of reasons to question the war means nearly every kind of lawmaker can get behind one, staffers and activists say.\n\nNew Voices In The Chorus\n\nAmy McGrath is used to people wanting to talk Afghanistan. They ask the retired Marine lieutenant colonel, a Kentucky Democrat who\u2019s become one of the best-known candidates for office this election cycle, why U.S. troops are still there and say it feels like America is losing. She told HuffPost she responds by creating a dialogue \u2015 she understands the frustration, but she feels at least some degree of American assistance is essential to prevent the creation of a militant haven.\n\nShe\u2019s quick to note that she hasn\u2019t been there since 2010, when she served her last tour in Helmand province.\n\nThat still, of course, gives her a degree of on-the-ground experience way beyond that of the vast majority of her future colleagues if she wins her tight race.\n\nAdam Beam/ASSOCIATED PRESS Democrat Amy McGrath speaks to supporters at a campaign field office in Winchester, Kentucky. She says Congress \"has totally punted\" the Afghanistan question.\n\n\u201cCongress for the last 17 years has totally punted it because they don\u2019t want to be held responsible,\u201d McGrath said of the debate over how to handle the war. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nTwo groups loom large in the crop of candidates key to the Democrats\u2019 hopes of taking the House and general energy around the party this year. Both will likely feature heavily in conversations about issues like Afghanistan.\n\nMilitary veterans like McGrath and civilians who have worked in national security, like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Andy Kim in New Jersey, have pitched their first-time campaigns as part of a lifelong call to duty on behalf of the country. Many of them are close to foreign policy experts \u2015 both Spanberger and McGrath have been in contact with Obama aides involved in the National Security Action group, spokespeople told HuffPost \u2015 who see Trump as a danger to important U.S. engagement around the world and are wary of radical change.\n\nThe other circle is identified with more proudly left candidates: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Rashida Tlaib in Michigan, Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar in Minnesota and Ammar Campa-Najjar in California. They\u2019re less vocal on foreign policy but are expected to line up with already elected allies, such as antiwar leader Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). They\u2019re all endorsed by the Khanna-linked group Justice Democrats, which was formed by former presidential campaign staff for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For now, they and their partners on Capitol Hill are focusing on the groundwork for a stronger progressive role in Congress more than on specific issues, a Democratic aide familiar with the interactions with HuffPost.\n\nShaped by similar experiences and politics, those groups are likely to rely on each other as they grapple with thorny new problems in their new jobs, united also by the sense of being newcomers.\n\n\u201cWhen we get together, we sort of all get it\u2026 we have all been over there, we know it,\u201d McGrath said. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), a Marine veteran who won a special election earlier this year, told HuffPost he hadn\u2019t yet heard of the progressive effort to withdraw from Afghanistan.\n\nWhen we get together, we sort of all get it\u2026 we have all been over there, we know it. congressional candidate Amy McGrath, a military veteran\n\nBut the blocs already agree on key fundamentals like resisting Trump\u2019s attacks on the Affordable Care Act or the need for changes to Democratic leadership in the House. On Afghanistan, too, the distinction doesn\u2019t have to lead to a clash \u2015 deep blue or only marginally Democratic districts nationwide seem fed up. Both sides told HuffPost that for now they\u2019re optimistic about working together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the number of veterans and national security officials running for office,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cNo one understands the costs and consequences of these wars better than them.\u201d\n\nAnd the next few weeks \u2015 right after the midterms \u2015 could show how that kind of cooperation is already happening.\n\nA Post-Midterm Model\n\nDemocrats hope to move by December against a different war: a U.S. campaign of aerial refueling, intelligence support and arms sales for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are jointly fighting a militant group supported by Iran in Yemen. It\u2019s a dry run of sorts for the Afghanistan fight.\n\nThe Yemen war, which began after the pro-Iran Houthi movement seized the capital from a Saudi-backed government, has produced the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis and bipartisan outrage in Congress reflected in increasingly tight votes on arms sales.\n\nNow Sanders, Khanna and others want the House and Senate to vote up or down on bills that would end U.S. support for the Saudi-UAE coalition altogether \u2015 and with United Nations warnings about the risk of famine growing more dire and outrage about U.S.-Saudi relations after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, they feel the time is ripe.\n\nA Democratic aide involved in the measure pointed to the support of the No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Smith of the Armed Services Committee, powerful Reps. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and scores of others, including some notable Republicans. In the Senate, Sanders and his allies had managed to win over more than half the chamber in the spring.\n\nAsked why not wait, particularly if the House does swing blue, the aide noted the fears of widespread starvation in Yemen and the belief that a vote against the war might send an important signal, putting the ball in Trump\u2019s court and setting Democrats up to press him in the new Congress.\n\nPresaging likely battles on Afghanistan and other controversial engagements like in Syria, the hope is the Yemen fight will unite Democrats around the U.S. war that\u2019s perhaps hardest of all to justify and show the party\u2019s base that its representatives can get things done.\n\n\u201cCongress has not reasserted its power on war-making for a very, very long time,\u201d said Kizer, the Win Without War activist. \u201cSo these war powers fights show they\u2019re starting to exercise that muscle and understanding that the public wants them to take up these hard votes.\u201d\n\nOr really, elections matter.\n\n\u201cWith this hopeful blue wave around trying to curb an out-of-control president, trying to rein him in in all forms and re-energize Congress as a co-equal branch, I think that that will also lend itself to building a more humane, restrained U.S. foreign policy,\u201d the aide said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-steyer-run-for-president-2020-donald-trump_us_5c34ed5fe4b01e2d51f80a81": "Billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist Tom Steyer announced Wednesday that he will not enter the 2020 race for president, ending speculation that he would be one of many candidates to make a bid for the Oval Office in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Steyer isn\u2019t trying to boot President Donald Trump from office. He will instead spend at least $40 million on impeachment efforts against Trump this year, he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest issue in American politics today,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cWe have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse.

He gave heavily to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and contributed more than $87 million to Democratic candidates during that election cycle. He was also a major donor to both of former President Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and was reportedly floated for various roles in the administration.\n\nBut I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.\n\nNotably, he has called for candidates to be aggressive in advocating for clean energy and has put his money toward a number of causes to fight climate change.\n\nSteyer has long positioned himself as a vocal adversary of Trump. He raised $10 million to run ads calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment and has spent more money to display impeachment billboards in New York City\u2019s Times Square.\n\nTheir beef isn\u2019t one-sided.

Alyssa Milano, an actress and activist, accompanies him.\n\nThe Intercept launched the Ady Barkan Reporting Fellowship on Monday, honoring a progressive activist with Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease at the center of protests against the GOP tax cut legislation and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Intercept, an online news site launched by eBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar in February 2014, hopes to crowdfund upwards of $70,000 to hire an experienced journalist for the year-long reporting fellowship. The recipient could begin as early as January and would be tasked with covering social movements and protests of the kind Barkan has led and championed.\n\nAlthough the fellowship is currently a one-time opportunity, The Intercept would ultimately like to fund a year-long fellowship in Barkan\u2019s honor every year, according to Ryan Grim, the outlet\u2019s Washington bureau chief. (Grim, who ran HuffPost\u2019s Washington bureau until June 2017, previously edited this reporter\u2019s work.)\n\nGrim was covering Barkan\u2019s protests of the Kavanaugh confirmation and approached him with the idea for the fellowship. Barkan, a regular opinion columnist for the Columbia University newspaper who interned for the editorial board of The Miami Herald, warmed to the proposal.\n\n\u201cI want to promote journalism with a conscience \u2015 journalism that takes the progressive movement seriously, and journalism that takes human dignity seriously,\u201d Barkan told HuffPost. \u201cI think the Intercept does all that, and I would love to help encourage more young journalists to pursue that kind of livelihood.\u201d\n\nBarkan, a 34-year-old attorney, has a history of innovating grassroots movements that force elected officials and technocrats to face the people affected by their decisions. As a leader at the Center for Popular Democracy, which advocates for low-income communities, Barkan pioneered the Fed Up campaign in 2014, which successfully nudged the Federal Reserve in a more progressive direction.\n\nIn October 2016, Barkan was diagnosed with ALS, a terminal disease that slowly paralyzes people. Barkan, who has a two-year-old son with his wife Rachael King, renewed his commitment to rank-and-file activism, vowing to do everything in his remaining days to stop President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, beginning with the proposed tax cuts.\n\n\u201cI can joke or say honestly that if I\u2019m gonna die really young, I wanna go down swinging, in a blaze of glory,\u201d Barkan told HuffPost in December 2017.\n\nBarkan began speaking publicly about his condition and became a leading figure in progressive protests against the GOP tax cut legislation on Capitol Hill. Relying increasingly on a wheelchair to get around, the steady progress of ALS slurring his voice, he spent weeks lobbying potential swing votes in the Senate Republican Caucus. He argued that the nearly $2 trillion the tax cuts added to the national debt would eventually be used to justify cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2015 endangering programs he would depend on as his illness worsened.\n\nDuring each visit from his home in Santa Barbara, California, to protest the tax cuts on Capitol Hill, Barkan would be arrested for civil disobedience while telling his personal story with the help of fellow activists, who repeated his words in an Occupy Wall Street-style \u201chuman mic.\u201d Despite Barkan\u2019s failing health, his leadership moved numerous people to get involved, according to Winnie Wong, a co-founder of The People for Bernie Sanders who got to know Barkan during protests against the tax cuts and the Kavanaugh confirmation.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he is leading in this moment is extremely inspiring because he simply doesn\u2019t have the physical strength to be doing this,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAs someone who is still very healthy and active, every time I see him being carted away to the Capitol Police holding pen where he has to sit and be processed for his civil disobedience action, my heart breaks.\u201d\n\nDavid Stubbs/Reuters Ady Barkan speaks to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen during the inaugural Fed Up protest in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 23, 2014.\n\nBarkan\u2019s activism became national news when he confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on a flight back from his first civil disobedience arrest in Washington. In a video conversation that went viral, Barkan told Flake to \u201cbe a hero\u201d and vote against the tax legislation.\n\nFlake, who listened patiently during their airplane meeting, did not heed Barkan\u2019s request. But thanks to the chance encounter, Barkan succeeded in drawing attention to the tax fight and its human ramifications. What\u2019s more, the phrase \u201cbe a hero\u201d became the namesake of both a nonprofit and political action committee Barkan launched to continue his work.\n\nBarkan\u2019s \u201cBe a Hero\u201d PAC crowdfunded six-figure ad buys highlighting his story in the special elections in Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District in April and Ohio\u2019s 12th in August. (The PAC, which benefits from Barkan\u2019s inspiring story and now-mammoth social media following, is spending some $5 million on advertising in 100 congressional districts.)\n\nBarkan returned to Capitol Hill over the summer to help fight Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. His body weaker and his voice harder to understand, he continued to pour his strength into speaking out against the then-nominee to the Supreme Court, joining legions of other activists arrested in acts of civil disobedience.\n\nBarkan estimates he has been arrested at least seven times in Capitol Hill protests since he first began demonstrating there in late 2017.\n\n\u2018If Susan Collins votes to confirm this terrible nominee we will use your money to replace her with someone better in 2020.

He came up with the idea of teaming up with Maine progressive groups to crowdfund a challenge to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh. The initiative rattled Collins, who routinely raises money from corporate PACs but called the effort tantamount to bribery.\n\nBarkan and his allies crowdfunded nearly $4 million for a potential Collins challenger. She nonetheless went on to vote for Kavanaugh, which most observers believe she was set to do regardless.\n\nIn the process, however, Barkan innovated a new form of grassroots organizing and kickstarted the Democratic campaign against Collins two years before her next Election Day in 2020. The pressure campaign against Collins, like Barkan\u2019s Federal Reserve organizing before that, showcased his talent for \u201ccreating new angles\u201d and \u201cdisrupting\u201d institutions like Congress, according to Grim.\n\n\u201cThe work that he does is so unique in that in some ways, it felt like it needed a unique position to cover it,\u201d Grim said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-democrats-support_us_5bef1186e4b0f32bd5897f22": "The Washington Post via Getty Images Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) arrives in Washington for orientation to the next Congress.\n\nJust three Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus have pledged this week to support Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s bid for a so-called Green New Deal, the only policy proposal scientists say is ambitious enough to avert catastrophic climate change in the coming decades.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jos\u00e9 Serrano, who represent the low-lying New York City districts neighboring Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, joined Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to become the first sitting lawmakers to back the Democratic star\u2019s resolution to establish a 15-member select committee on the all-encompassing climate policy in the next Congress.\n\nThe Green New Deal committee, meant to include six Republicans, would be charged with drafting a 10-year federal infrastructure and jobs plan to neutralize the United States\u2019 output of greenhouse gas emissions, adopt 100 percent renewable electricity and reduce widening income inequality. The resolution would likely seek to bar lawmakers who have accepted donations from fossil fuel companies from serving.\n\nMaloney, Serrano and Khanna joined incoming House members Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) to support the proposal. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) did not return a request for comment, but told protesters on Friday he supported the Green New Deal.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the speed with which the Green New Deal has surged from the fringes of a long-stagnant climate debate into the mainstream. But the policy faces daunting obstacles. Democrats\u2019 long-standing obsession with balanced budgets is at odds with a plan to spend trillions on clean-energy research and building weatherization retrofits and infrastructure for renewable electricity \u2015 especially when Republican tax cuts are ballooning the national deficit.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders are considering a rule that would require a supermajority to raise income taxes \u2015 all but crippling any expensive, big-ticket legislation like a Green New Deal or Medicare for all, the popular proposal for universal health care.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, remain in the thralls of climate change denialism, and are closely allied with deep-pocketed oil, gas and coal companies eager to upend any such legislation.\n\n\u201cGiven that we are at or near full employment, the green jobs concept seems a bit distant from our current reality,\u201d former Rep.

But the idea is a good one.\u201d\n\nTwo California Democrats, Reps. Nanette Diaz Barrag\u00e1n and Alan Lowenthal, said they support the spirit of the Green New Deal, but oppose the creation of any new select committees on climate change.\n\n\u201cI fully embrace the enthusiasm behind the Green New Deal and support many of its aims,\u201d Barrag\u00e1n said in a statement. \u201cHowever, I agree with soon-to-be Chairman Pallone that creating an entirely new committee would only delay our efforts to combat this urgent problem.\u201d\n\nAnother lawmaker in the Golden State delegation, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, said he \u201csupports the intent of the legislation and looks forward to reviewing the resolution in full and discussing with colleagues.\u201d\n\nThe statements came as the death toll from two wildfires in California soared to 66, with the Camp fire in Northern California becoming the state\u2019s deadliest blaze in history during what was once its rainy season.

The findings also indicate potential challenges of selling moderate Democrats from more conservative districts on the populist branding of policies packaged in a Green New Deal.\n\nData for Progress\n\nForty-seven percent of survey respondents were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports a Green New Deal, while only 18 percent vowed to back someone who opposed the policy. Another 22 percent said support for a Green New Deal had no impact on their vote, and 13 percent were not sure.\n\nThe polling \u2015 conducted between Dec. 17 and Dec. 27 by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and shared exclusively with HuffPost \u2015 shows particularly strong support for a Green New Deal among women in the suburban portions of the Nassau County district abutting the New York City borough of Queens.\n\nForty-eight percent of women and 44 percent of men supported a pro-Green New Deal candidate. Yet 30 percent of men said they\u2019d back a candidate who opposed a Green New Deal, compared to just 10 percent of women who said the same.\n\nForty-nine percent of suburban voters in the district supported a Green New Deal candidate, compared to just 31 percent of urban voters. By contrast, 14 percent of suburban voters said they\u2019d support an anti-Green New Deal primary candidate, while 43 percent of urban voters said they\u2019d do the same.\n\nOlder voters, whites and Asians made up the strongest base of support for a pro-Green New Deal Democrat. Such a hypothetical candidate garnered 57 percent support from voters over 65 and 55 percent among voters aged 55 to 64.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Asian voters in the sample said they\u2019d support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, followed by 51 percent of whites, 39 percent of blacks and 33 percent of Hispanics.\n\n\u201cThe strongest margin of support are older suburban women,\u201d said Evan Roth Smith, co-founder of the polling firm Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. \u201cThat is the constituency for a Green New Deal in her district.\u201d\n\nRice did not join a handful of other Democrats in the New York delegation in supporting Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s resolution for a select committee on a Green New Deal. But in a statement to HuffPost, Rice said she supports \u201crobust federal investment in energy-efficient infrastructure projects and training for green energy jobs\u201d and said \u201cmembers of Congress committed to this fight should no longer accept campaign contributions from oil and gas companies.\u201d\n\nIn my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\n\n\u201cFighting climate change isn\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about protecting our homes and jobs and preserving our communities for future generations,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe survey found Rice has a 70 percent approval rating \u2015 higher than Pelosi\u2019s, as The Washington Post first reported. Still, Nassau County activist Siela Bynoe said she is considering a primary challenge in 2020.\n\nThe polling is the first in a series surveying districts where incumbent Democrats could be vulnerable to a progressive primary challenge in 2020.\n\nRice, who has built a strong base of support over the last five years, has not faced a primary challenger since she made her inaugural bid in 2014. The former Nassau County prosecutor\u2019s votes in favor of environmental legislation and against deregulatory efforts earned her a 100 percent score on the League of Conservation Voters\u2019 2017 ranking. Her lifetime score is 95 percent.\n\nIn 2015, she crusaded against plans to build a liquefied natural gas terminal off the coast of Jones Beach. In 2017, she co-sponsored legislation to mandate 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Rice proposed legislation last year to prohibit members of Congress from serving on public companies\u2019 boards, and fought for more aid to victims still struggling to recover from 2012\u2032s Hurricane Sandy.\n\nBut Rice has long wooed Republicans. In the four years leading up to 2013, she accepted donations from Donald Trump totaling $53,000. Her father, a contractor who became the building commissioner of New York\u2019s Archdiocese, registered as a Republican after moving to once deep-red Nassau County. Because New York\u2019s primaries are closed to nonpartisans, he registered as a Democrat only when his daughter ran in a primary for district attorney, according to a New York Times profile from March 2014.\n\nRice won endorsements from a handful of GOP officials in her district in 2016. Since 2016, she\u2019s voted in favor of legislation Trump pushed just over 30 percent of the time, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, which predicted, based on Trump\u2019s support in her district, that figure would be closer to 48 percent.\n\nSunrise Movement Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) joined a protest led by the climate justice group Sunrise Movement in November, helping to propel a Green New Deal into the mainstream political debate.\n\nHer vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the Democratic electorate. Support for a Green New Deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. Among New York 4th Congressional District voters who picked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn\u2019t. Among voters who picked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a Green New Deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don\u2019t.\n\nThe results mirror support for Ocasio-Cortez, whose surprise primary victory over the summer skyrocketed the 29-year-old to national fame. In Rice\u2019s district, 52 percent of those polls viewed Ocasio-Cortez favorably, of which 56 percent said they\u2019d support a Green New Deal proponent in a 2020 primary.\n\n\u201cOcasio-Cortez has clearly broken through,\u201d Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress, said by phone. \u201cPeople like Ocasio-Cortez are more than willing to primary a Democrat for not supporting a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nBut reaching a point where there\u2019s enough \u201corganic buzz\u201d around a Green New Deal that it\u2019s a \u201ctopic of discussion beyond the direct actions of a primary opponent,\u201d will require a lot of work, said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive strategist.\n\nThe policy stormed into mainstream political debate over the past two months after activists staged sit-ins in Pelosi\u2019s office and Ocasio-Cortez proposed a resolution to establish a select committee charged with drafting a Green New Deal. Eighty-two percent of Americans said they had heard \u201cnothing at all\u201d about a Green New Deal, yet 81 percent of registered voters said they supported the policies outlined under early proposals, according to a survey released last month by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University.\n\nNinety-two percent of Democrats supported the Green New Deal, including 93 percent of liberal Democrats and 90 percent of moderate-to-conservative Democrats. But, more surprisingly, 64 percent of Republicans backed the policy, including 75 percent of moderate-to-liberal Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\n\nThe poll found that as the policy becomes more associated with leftist politicians like Ocasio-Cortez, support among conservatives is likely to wane.\n\nMost of the Democrats likely to run for president in 2020 are now giving their support to a Green New Deal. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who this week announced an exploratory committee for a potential bid, became the latest on Tuesday when she told Axios she supports the \u201cidea\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nBut convincing voters that punishing a Democrat like Rice who opposes the policy is \u201ca boon to a Green New Deal\u2019s chances of implementation\u201d is another challenge altogether, Hauser said.\n\n\u201cIt is seems more than plausible to me but rather very likely that if made salient to voters, opposition to a Green New Deal would be deeply dangerous for the primary chances of any incumbent Democrat,\u201d Hauser said by email. \u201cHowever the work of making it salient is no small task.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/critics-attack-trump-for-burying-release-of-clime-report-during-holiday_us_5bf9da14e4b0771fb6b9568a": "Critics are slamming the Trump administration\u2019s cunning timing for releasing a devastating federal report exposing the appalling consequences of continued climate change.\n\nThe 1,700-page report, produced by scientists from 13 federal agencies, warns that tens of thousands of people will die each year, and that livelihoods, agriculture, the economy and the environment will be destroyed as unchecked climate change wreaks havoc.\n\nThe National Climate Assessment was released the day after Thanksgiving.

The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.\u201d\n\nA second report by New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company based in Austin, Texas, focused on which groups were targeted and how.

The voter suppression effort was focused particularly on Sanders supporters and African-Americans, urging them to shun Mrs. Clinton in the general election and either vote for Ms. Stein or stay home.\n\nThe IRA, whose leadership has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, used an array of tactics to get its message out. Sometimes it gathered followers with a Facebook or Instagram page about something relatively innocuous \u2015 like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d or \u201cThe Muppet Show\u201d \u2015 and then switched to political content.

So of course everything was dead silence.\u201d Bill and his co-workers finished out the day, and not knowing what else to do he said fuck it, let\u2019s go bowling, and, man, is he glad he did because it was the best game of his life. He\u2019d never bowled so well in decades of trying. He\u2019d never bowl so well again. Amid the chaos and fear and uncertainty of the world changing in ways neither he nor the rest of us yet understood, Bill Moro went and bowled a perfect damn game on 9/11. I first heard about Bill\u2019s game this summer, when someone on Twitter posted a picture of him. When you bowl a perfect game at the Cove Lanes there in Great Barrington, they go and put your photo on the wall as a way of commemorating the occasion.\n\nMy brother was at a bowling alley in western mass and he sent me this iconic photo of a dude who bowled a perfect game on 9/11 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/6srCon1KMa \u2014 jake bender (@JakeSBender) June 29, 2018\n\nI knew instantly I wanted to talk to Bill when I saw the photo, but he wasn\u2019t so easy to track down. I reached out to the bowling alley and after a couple weeks Juanita O\u2019Rourke, one of the owners, wrote me back.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the bowler who bowled the 300 on 9/11 no longer bowls at the Cove and has not for many years,\u201d she told me. \u201cI do not have contact information for him although I do believe he is local. Hope that gives you something to go on,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSorry I\u2019m not much help.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke bought the lanes with two of her nephews in 2003. Both of the nephews had worked there doing odd jobs in exchange for unlimited video games when they were kids. The timing of the purchase was perfect for one of them, Michael Hankey. He was looking to try something new after he\u2019d lost his job of 10 years at the Rising Mill, which had been shuttered by new ownership the year before. Built in 1873, the Rising Mill was once the biggest employer in the area and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nI asked everyone I knew from the Berkshire County region if they knew anyone named Bill Moro. Why, they\u2019d ask. Uh \u2026 because I saw he bowled a perfect game on 9/11, and I wanted to interview him about that, I said, which made me feel like a pervert of some kind.\n\nAnd then, finally, on 9/11 of this year, I found what I thought might be the number and address for a William Moro in Great Barrington. Could it be him? Would he even still be alive?\n\nIt was our man. The man. Bill the man.\n\nHis lovely wife answered the phone and didn\u2019t seem all that surprised when I explained sheepishly what I was calling about. \u201cSeventeen years ago today he bowled a perfect game down there,\u201d she told me with pride. It was as if they\u2019d been waiting for someone to call this entire time.\n\nBill and I had a great chat, and then the next day my computer crashed. Motherfucker.\n\nThe interview, along with a ton of other work I\u2019d been doing, disappeared forever. Was I getting too close to the truth?\n\nA couple months later, I said screw it and decided I\u2019d call Bill back and do it all over again. I didn\u2019t want to let his story go untold. He was happy to oblige me. After all, 9/11 was one of the best days of his life.\n\nBill and I talked about his big game, the changes to Great Barrington and the paper industry, and his opinions on everything from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders to, well, let\u2019s just say the pins weren\u2019t the only thing Bill was surprised to see fall so fast that day.\n\nWalk me through the game that night. When was it?\n\nWell, we started at 6:30 in the evening for practice, and then at 7 the league starts. So of course everybody was talking about the events of the day.\n\nAnd you all decided, despite what happened, you might as well go bowling anyway?\n\nYeah. They still held the leagues. Everybody else was going to be there, and they didn\u2019t cancel anything, so all the teams showed up.\n\nHow regularly had you been bowling?\n\nOnce a week. We bowled every Tuesday night.\n\nTell me a little more about the day.\n\nI was at work when it happened. Of course we didn\u2019t have a television there, but we had a radio and a newsflash came across the radio. So of course everything was dead silence. We\u2019re listening and listening to all the things that are going on. We stayed at work. When I got out of work, I went home and watched the news, got home probably 3:30-ish, had supper, then I got ready to go bowling. Just had the TV on all the while listening to all the updates and the reruns, the constant reruns they were showing.\n\nWhen we got to the lanes, of course everybody was talking there, and they had TVs on at the bar. It was a lot of conversation about \u2026 wondering what would happen next.\n\nDo you remember what you were all thinking? Were you scared? Did you think we were going to go to war?\n\nWell, we knew it was a terrorist attack, and the investigation was where they came from, how they got in, how they managed to do all that. It was a high alert for everything, railroads, planes. Of course they grounded all the planes. There was no war, we weren\u2019t worried about war, but the talk was about getting back at them. Find out who did it and strike back.\n\nWas that your first perfect game?\n\nYes! My one and only. It was fantastic. I had been bowling steadily in leagues probably, let\u2019s see, I started in leagues when I was around 28 or so. I\u2019m 67 years old now.\n\nWas it common for other guys in the league to bowl perfect games?\n\nWell, there\u2019s a few guys that \u2026 they have a lot of pictures on the walls down there of people who bowled 300. Once you get one, they put your picture up. There\u2019s some guys, I\u2019ve got a couple of nephews, I think one of them has probably 30 perfect games.\n\nWow, that\u2019s crazy.\n\nI never bowled a perfect game again. I haven\u2019t bowled in probably 12, 13 years now.\n\nWhy did you stop?\n\nBecause of the establishment. They weren\u2019t taking care of the facilities very well. The league started, well, we think they were screwing around with the money, so our team voted to drop right out. We got tired of it.\n\nYou didn\u2019t go to another lane?\n\nThe only one nearby is up in Pittsfield, about 14 miles from here. It wasn\u2019t worth traveling all the way up there, bowl for two and half, three hours, then come back late at night.\n\nBoston Globe via Getty Images Ryan Isherwood inspects the quality of the paper inside Onyx Specialty Papers in Lee, Massachusetts.\n\nYeah, that doesn\u2019t make sense. You recently retired from the paper mill you worked at?\n\nI\u2019m gonna retire next March. I\u2019ll have 50 years in. Now it\u2019s called Onyx Specialty Papers.\n\nWhat exactly do you do?\n\nPersonally? I finish and ship rolls. It\u2019s a machine, you\u2019re operating a machine, and then you\u2019re on a clamp truck, where you load trailers. You do office paper work. \u2026 I started in the paper mill when I was 18.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed about it since then?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot. The progress of the equipment, different papers they make, new procedures. A lot of changes in 50 years!\n\nPeople don\u2019t seem to use as much paper as we used to, right?\n\nIt depends on the papers now. It\u2019s different papers that we make. It\u2019s a specialty. It\u2019s not writing paper, it\u2019s not newspaper, it\u2019s papers they use in transmissions, friction papers. One of our biggest items now is a blood paper they use for sampling blood \u2015 that goes all over the country. We make paper for laminates.\n\nI guess people don\u2019t really think about paper that much.\n\nExactly!\n\nWere you in a union there?\n\nNo, they never had a union. They had a couple of votes years ago, and they never passed, so we\u2019ve never been unionized.\n\nThey treat you OK though?\n\nYeah. The pay is good and the benefits are good.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m interested in your story is because there\u2019s something fascinating about going bowling directly after a terrorist attack, right?\n\nThat was the concept. Rudy Giuliani at the time said America\u2019s gonna go about their duty, we\u2019re not gonna let this divert us in anyway. We\u2019re America, we\u2019re not gonna be scared by this. Everybody should do what they do, and we did. The whole country did. We didn\u2019t just stop. We had jobs to go to, functions to go to.\n\nDo you remember what people were saying, any conversations?\n\nNo, just discussing who did it and why and how they managed to get on board. You can think about it now, but there\u2019s all these conspiracy theories they have out there now, too. I\u2019ve been looking at a lot of that online.\n\nYou find it a little suspicious how the buildings came down, right?\n\nOh, yeah. When you hear experts say it was a planned demolition, the way they came down. Thermite and different things that were used, and how fast they cleaned up and got rid of evidence. You gotta admit they did a quick job cleaning up that mess to get things back in order. And Building 7, which was not affected at all. That just came down? That was very suspicious to me.\n\nDo you believe any of these other conspiracy theories they have going around now?\n\nThere\u2019s a few. The biggest one they were talking about on the news just recently was about the Kennedy assassination. The anniversary of that. The government hiding things.\n\nWho do you think did that?\n\nOh, well, from what I understand [Lyndon] Johnson had a lot to do with it. He and [John F.] Kennedy were always feuding. Kennedy said something or did something to Johnson, and Johnson said he wasn\u2019t going to let him get away with it. They had an interview with Johnson\u2019s mistress. She gave a lot of evidence too, so \u2026\n\nInteresting. The world is pretty crazy.\n\nIt is.\n\nYou\u2019re not a Trump guy, though, right? What do you think about him?\n\nNo! I despise the man. He\u2019s not doing a good job at all. I don\u2019t like his arrogance. He\u2019s manipulative. He wants to be like Putin. He wants to be a tyrant. He wants total control, control over the judiciary, over everything. He gives his family, who are not qualified for the positions, he gives them positions.\n\nWere you a Clinton supporter?\n\nWell \u2026 much of what she did was good, but because of all the allegations and stuff, we were kind of tired of Clinton for a while. Eight years of her husband, then all her positions in the State Department and everything else. I really don\u2019t know, just time for new blood.\n\nWhat about Bernie [Sanders]?\n\nBernie had very good ideas for the people. Universal health care, that\u2019s one of the big topics. One thing Trump wanted was to get rid of Obamacare. He was gonna make it better \u2015 repeal and replace, all that. He hasn\u2019t done anything for health care!\n\nYou prefer candidates that care about working people.\n\nAbsolutely. The rich are getting richer. The tax plan just showed that. That was supposed to be trickle-down. Look what\u2019s happening with GM now. Closing plants, thousands of people going to be out of work. It\u2019s just not working.\n\nWhat\u2019s Great Barrington like? Kind of artsy and cute?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a tourist place now. Antique stores, just a lot of shops. A quaint little town.\n\nHas it changed since you were a kid?\n\nYes, it has. It\u2019s gotten \u2026 it\u2019s changed a lot for the wealthy people. You\u2019ve got tourists that come in from the cities, so that changes prices and attitudes. Some of the out-of-towners have gotten involved in restructuring the view of the town. They redid the whole Main Street, which is a mess. It\u2019s not very good.\n\nDid they put a marijuana dispensary out there? What do you think about that?\n\nWe have one here. I never had marijuana. I don\u2019t do drugs, never did. So I don\u2019t \u2026 I guess it\u2019s OK. If alcohol is legal \u2015 they\u2019re just going to have to monitor it the same way they do alcohol.\n\nI think I read somewhere that Cove Lanes was supposed to be an influence on the Farrelly brothers. You know those guys? [Editor\u2019s note: In fact, the Coen brothers, who made \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d are the directorial duo said to have bowled at Cove Lanes as college students.]\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know them. I never heard that.\n\nThey made the movie \u201cKingpin.\u201d You ever see that?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve seen that!\n\nDo you have a favorite bowling movie?\n\nOh, I don\u2019t know that there are many.\n\nWhat about \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d?\n\nNope.\n\nOh, you gotta watch it. It\u2019s so good.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-media-pipe-bombs-republicans_us_5bd3ab97e4b0a8f17ef7bd1e": "President Donald Trump attacked the news media yet again at a rally on Friday, just hours after law enforcement apprehended a suspect in connection with over a dozen package bombs mailed to Democratic public figures and CNN this week.\n\nAt a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Friday evening, Trump first thanked law enforcement for capturing the mail bomb suspect, identified as 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc from South Florida. The president said the \u201cterrorist actions\u201d should be punished \u201cto the fullest extent of the law,\u201d and added that \u201cpolitical violence must never, ever be allowed in America.\u201d\n\nThen, moments after saying that the nation was having \u201ca broader conversation about the tone and civility of our national dialogue\u201d and that we should \u201cunify as a nation in peace, love and harmony,\u201d Trump attacked the news media for its \u201ctone\u201d and \u201cdriv[ing] people apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media has a major role to play, whether they want to or not.

Very unfortunate, what is going on.\u201d\n\nAt another rally on Wednesday, Trump called for unity and vowed to bring to justice the people responsible for the week\u2019s bomb scare \u2015 but he also criticized and partially blamed the media.\n\n\u201cAs part of a larger national effort to bridge our divides and bring people together, the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to stop, bring people together.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-fox-news-pocahontas-2020_us_5c2e4cf2e4b05c88b70730eb": "President Donald Trump sure does love his nicknames \u2015 and surely he must be glad to see any of them pop up on Fox News.\n\nTucker Carlson\u2019s Wednesday evening broadcast featured one such moment with this scornfully racist chyron: \u201cPocahontas 2020?\u201d\n\n\u201cPocahontas,\u201d of course, is Trump\u2019s nickname for Sen.

Just a couple of weeks ago this city was shrouded in a suffocating blanket of wildfire smoke that had traveled down from giant blazes in the north.

Sunrise Movement\u2019s most recent campaign has been focused on putting pressure on members of Congress to support Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in pushing for a Green New Deal, a policy proposal aiming to ensure a just and rapid transition to a decarbonized economy.\n\nFollowing a day of sit-ins and protests on Monday outside the Capitol Hill office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 which drew in thousands and saw more than 130 arrested \u2014 the action in San Francisco on Tuesday also targeted Pelosi, whose local district office was just on the other side of the demonstrators\u2019 human barricade.\n\nRobert Raymond The Sunrise Movement demonstration in San Francisco, where protestors called for a Green New Deal.\n\nPelosi, likely the next Speaker of the House, will be in charge of shaping the House legislative agenda for the next two years.

They say they\u2019re done asking politely and are no longer willing to accept the inaction, ineptitude and corruption that pervade the corridors of power. They are willing to put their bodies upon the gears, the wheels and the levers of the carbon economy \u2014 and they have very good reasons for it.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images Demonstrators at the COP24 climate conference on Dec. 10 in Katowice, Poland, respond to Donald Trump's advisor Wells Griffith saying the U.S. will not reject coal mining or fossil fuel use.\n\nThe report may have left many curled up into a quivering ball of despair \u2014 if not physically, then at least emotionally. The end of the world is a profoundly moving and yet paralyzing proposition to comprehend.

Perhaps not unlike Al Gore\u2019s jaw-dropping emissions chart in \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d the report seems to have hit a collective nerve. It\u2019s a line in the sand.

In the United Kingdom, a group calling themselves Extinction Rebellion has been organizing giant swarms around cities like London and putting together flash mobs that disrupt traffic at high-profile spots. Their aim is to put pressure on those in power and increase the public\u2019s awareness of climate change by disrupting the material flows of the U.K. economy.\n\nLarch Maxey is a coordinator with Extinction Rebellion in London. He\u2019s a veteran of the climate justice movement and helped to organize the group\u2019s recent Rebellion Day on Nov. 17. The day of mass civil disobedience drew in around 6,000 people, according to the group, and shut down five major bridges in London.\n\nNIKLAS HALLE'N via Getty Images Environmental activists gather in Parliament Square, London, the U.K., during a demonstration organised by the movement Extinction Rebellion on Nov. 24, 2018.\n\n\u201cNonviolent direct action with a mass movement behind it is the best opportunity we\u2019ve got at this point,\u201d Maxey told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried many things over the last few decades \u2014 marches, petitions, academic papers, reports \u2014 I\u2019ve personally tried all of those. But I don\u2019t hold a lot of hope for those processes anymore.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion has declared open rebellion against the U.K. Parliament because they believe the social contract had been broken. Their proclamation has resonated with tens of thousands of people all across the U.K. Maxey refers to a 17-year-old called Jack who took part in November\u2019s mass disruption.\n\n\u201cHe just turned up and swarmed with us,\u201d Maxey said. \u201cThe second day, he led a swarm. The third day, he was coordinating his own roadblock.\u201d He says Jack\u2019s story is similar to many others who have recently joined Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really refreshing that you\u2019ve not got all the baggage that you\u2019ve often got with the old guard,\u201d Maxey said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say some of us old codgers aren\u2019t useful and bringing value to it \u2014 but I think it\u2019s really important that we are all equals in this movement.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion is currently working to launch chapters across the globe, including in the United States, where the brand new San Francisco Bay Area chapter is just getting off the ground.\n\nRussell Gray, 24, is the full-time coordinator for Extinction Rebellion U.S. He helped to coordinate the group\u2019s Declaration of Rebellion action earlier this month on Capitol Hill, and has been working with organizers like Zack Exley \u2014 a senior adviser for Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign \u2014 to help establish new chapters forming all across the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur biggest priority right now is growth,\u201d Gray told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to establish chapters in as many areas as we can and it\u2019s exciting because we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from both urban and rural areas \u2014 major coastal cities but also places like Montana and Wyoming.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion U.S. is currently coordinating a national day of action for Jan. 26 that will consist of mass disruptions. They are hoping to take advantage of their increasing momentum to mobilize as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cWe have to disrupt the whole system,\u201d Gray told HuffPost. \u201cAnd if we are to avert runaway warming it\u2019s going to be because of a social movement. There\u2019s no other place that that power can be marshaled to successfully overcome the power of profit and capital.\u201d\n\nCurrently only two countries have made commitments or efforts that would achieve the Paris accord\u2019s goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. In fact, according to The Climate Action Tracker project, the United States itself is on track for over 4 degrees of warming. And with the confirmation that the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, has refused to adopt the IPCC\u2019s most recent report, it\u2019s never been more clear that change is not going to come from above.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long shot and we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Gray acknowledged. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I need to be in this fight.

A spokesperson for O\u2019Rourke said he is \u201csupportive of the concept\u201d of a Green New Deal and \u201chow it invests in green jobs.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke is the latest potential 2020 presidential candidate to get behind a Green New Deal.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, a spokesman for O\u2019Rourke, whose high-profile bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) propelled the former House Democrat from Texas onto the national stage last year, said he is \u201csupportive of the concept\u201d of a Green New Deal and \u201chow it invests in green jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201c[He] is looking forward to engaging more on the issue as it continues to develop,\u201d Chris Evans, a spokesman for O\u2019Rourke, said by email Friday. \u201cAs he mentioned while traveling to every county across Texas during his senate campaign, he\u2019s proud to come from a renewable energy producing state that is number one in wind power production, number one in wind power jobs and number one in solar energy potential.\u201d\n\nThree days ago, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who on Monday announced the launch of an exploratory committee for a presidential bid, told Axios she supports the \u201cidea\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nThe term surged into mainstream political discourse just two months ago when activists staged a protest in now\u2013House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, demanding that the incoming Democratic majority in the House champion a sweeping climate policy to zero out greenhouse gas emissions and combat worsening income inequality. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal and garnered support from about 40 House Democrats.\n\nAP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite Protesters with the Sunrise Movement stage a sit-in in the office of Rep. Steny Hoyer, now the House majority leader, late last year to demand a Green New Deal.\n\nDemocratic leadership rejected the plan, but the effort succeeded in shifting the climate debate in the direction scientists say matches the extent of the crisis. By mid-December, more than 300 local and state officials voiced support for a Green New Deal in an open letter. Days later, a poll from Yale University and George Mason University found 81 percent of registered voters surveyed said they supported a Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\n\nNinety-two percent of Democrats said supported the concept, including 93 percent of liberal Democrats and 90 percent of moderate to conservative Democrats.\n\nThat popularity is reflected in the growing number of likely presidential contenders endorsing a Green New Deal with varying degrees of couched language.\n\nBeto is supportive of the concept and how it invests in green jobs, and is looking forward to engaging more on the issue as it continues to develop. Spokesman for former Rep. Beto O'Rourke\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who sponsored what some saw as an early version of the Green New Deal in 2012, backs the policy and is planning to introduce legislation on it this year. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) was among the first in the Senate to endorse Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s select committee push. Long shot Richard Ojeda, a populist Democrat from West Virginia\u2019s coal country who was the first to announce a bid for president, shortly after losing a House race in November, gave the Green New Deal his full-throated support.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) indicated her support for a Green New Deal last month. Days later, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced his support for the policy in a tweet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to see so many 2020 hopefuls and 2020 potential candidates embracing the idea of a Green New Deal,\u201d Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, said by phone Friday. \u201cWe hope to further define the scope and scale of what the Green New Deal is and what it can do for our economy and our country.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s embrace of a Green New Deal is likely to face skepticism among progressives advocating the policy. He won early endorsements from environmental groups when he challenged Cruz, a climate change denier and fossil fuel ideologue. But O\u2019Rourke, who declined donations from corporate political action committees during his Senate campaign, generated controversy last month over fossil fuel donations he received.\n\nO\u2019Rourke had won plaudits for taking the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge administered by the watchdog group Oil Change USA, which bars politicians from accepting contributions over $200 from \u201cPACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies.\u201d In December the investigative news site Sludge found that he accepted $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry, 75 percent of which came in the form of donations over $200. Fossil fuel executives made at least 29 large donations.\n\nHe was removed from the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge roster, and the revelations prompted fresh scrutiny of his voting record. The Houston Chronicle, the newspaper of record in Texas\u2019 biggest city, criticized his oil and gas ties in an editorial and warned that \u201cif fans of fossil fuels can\u2019t find an effective way to address climate change, Texas will have to start dealing with problems even more destructive than an oil bust.\u201d\n\nSunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash, whose climate-justice group spearheaded the push for a Green New Deal, said the growing number of 2020 presidential contenders backing the policy \u201cshows how much the movement has shifted the conversation on climate in American politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we\u2019ll be organizing all across the country to build on the momentum and make it clear to all politicians that if they want to be taken seriously by young people, they need to sign the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge and back the Green New Deal,\u201d she said by email.\n\nStill, to some, a lawmaker from a top oil-producing state like Texas nodding to a Green New Deal signals \u201ca major shift\u201d in the national debate, said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who is tracking how the policy is being discussed.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to make this transition, it has to be a transition that engages the whole country, so it is important that it\u2019s not just a dialogue led by people in New York and Massachusetts,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt has to encompass all parts of the country.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-stacey-abrams-georgia-governor_us_5bdcee5ae4b01ffb1d0250f7": "Former President Barack Obama spoke at a campaign rally Friday for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Georgia, and insisted on the importance of exercising one\u2019s right to vote \u2015 particularly in the face of efforts to suppress it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll try to disenfranchise people and take away their right to vote,\u201d Obama said in his speech at the campaign event just days before the Nov. 6 midterm elections, organized by the Georgia Democratic Party at Morehouse College, a historically black, all-male school in Atlanta. (Abrams graduated from neighboring Spelman, a historically black women\u2019s college.)\n\n\u201cStacey\u2019s opponent has already been caught multiple times,\u201d the former president added.\n\nAbrams is in a tight and potentially historic race for governor against Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) \u2015 vying to become the country\u2019s first black female governor.\n\nThe Georgia gubernatorial race has gotten heated around voting rights controversies. Last month, an Associated Press report found that over 53,000 voter applications, nearly 70 percent of which were from black people, were on hold for verification with Kemp\u2019s office. Kemp, in his role as secretary of state, oversees elections.\n\nAbrams has accused Kemp of voter suppression. Kemp has called such accusations a \u201cfarce\u201d and insisted that people with \u201cpending\u201d registrations could still vote. (Those 53,000 voters can vote on Election Day if they show up to the polls with an accepted form of photo ID \u2015 but they can\u2019t vote absentee or by mail until they resolve the discrepancies with their registrations.)\n\nGeorgia \u201cpurged twice as many voters \u2014 1.5 million \u2014 between the 2012 and 2016 elections as it did between 2008 and 2012,\u201d according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Kemp took office in 2010.\n\n\u201cGeorgia, be unafraid,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf they try to take away your right to vote, there\u2019s only one way to take it back: Vote.\u201d\n\n. @BarackObama: \u201cIf they try to take away your right to vote, there\u2019s only one way to take it back: VOTE\u201d pic.twitter.com/rvZ19VXtaz \u2014 Georgia Democrat (@GeorgiaDemocrat) November 2, 2018\n\nAt her rally Friday, Abrams spoke of her own history working on voting rights issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to do this against Georgia\u2019s homegrown architect of voter suppression,\u201d she said, in an apparent reference to Kemp.\n\nCivil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who also spoke at Abrams\u2019 rally Friday, recalled decades-old voter suppression tactics like literacy tests meant to disenfranchise black voters, saying, \u201cThere are forces in America that want to take us back \u2015 but we\u2019re not going back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave enough blood on that bridge in Selma 53 years ago. I almost died, some of my friends were murdered,\u201d Lewis added. \u201cI\u2019m not asking any of you to give any blood, I\u2019m just asking you to go and vote like you never voted before.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to headline a rally for Kemp in Macon, Georgia, on Sunday. Earlier this week, Kemp pulled out of the second and final debate he and Abrams were scheduled to have on Sunday in order to join Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nTo that, Obama said: \u201cI saw [Abrams\u2019] opponent backed out of that debate. What\u2019s he afraid of? He\u2019s afraid of Stacey, I guess.\u201d\n\nAbrams has garnered a number of high-profile endorsements: Oprah Winfrey, in a rare political endorsement, gave a speech and knocked on doors for Abrams this week. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter have all endorsed Abrams, along with celebrities Will Ferrell, Tracee Ellis Ross and Uzo Aduba.\n\nObama has endorsed Abrams along with a slew of other Democratic candidates, including Lucy McBath, running for Congress in Georgia\u2019s 6th district, who also spoke at Friday\u2019s rally. Earlier Friday, Obama stumped for Democrat Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor in Florida.\n\n\u201cCongressman John Lewis is here. John saw this game being played before,\u201d Obama said at Abrams\u2019 rally Friday, noting the country had gone through other tough periods in history.\n\n\u201cJohn Lewis didn\u2019t sit back and say, \u2018I hope some day it\u2019ll get better.\u2019 ...

Even though we essentially have everyone in the world at our fingertips, we inevitably fall back into our in-groups. HuffPost can reveal that \u2015 shock, horror \u2015 the people we rely on to weigh evidence and make decisions on behalf of the American people are not immune to this.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s dive into the followers of the potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, we decided to turn things around and look at the interests of the politicians themselves: We\u2019ve compiled an enormous data set that shows who people in both chambers of Congress are following on Twitter. The results point to a significant partisan divide and give a glimpse into the wildly different places where Democrats and Republicans get their information.\n\nThe Nerdy Bit: Methodology\n\nTo put this together, we attempted to compile as complete a list of congressional Twitter accounts as possible \u2015 which was harder than you might think, as there is no central list. When a member of Congress had multiple accounts \u2015 for example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has @ewarren and @SenWarren for her campaign and her congressional office, respectively \u2015 we lumped together the follows rather than try to arbitrate which was the \u201creal\u201d account. So, in this example, if @ewarren follows a given account but @SenWarren doesn\u2019t, that still counts as a follow. For the purposes of keeping count, we\u2019ve decided to count independent Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Angus King (Maine) as Democrats because that\u2019s who they caucus with.\n\nThese numbers are inevitably not going to be 100 percent accurate: There could be accounts we missed or other errors \u2015 not to mention the simple fact that politicians follow and unfollow accounts all the time. But we believe our data is good enough to draw the following interesting conclusions, even given those caveats.\n\nTo keep things clear, we stuck to using data from the House only in the tables below \u2015 but on the bar charts toward the end you\u2019ll see we also collected Senate data. You can use the widget at the bottom to explore data from both chambers.\n\nA Congress Divided\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s take a look at the Twitter accounts most likely to be followed by House Republicans. The most followed accounts are directly related to their work, with the GOP leadership and recently departed Speaker Paul Ryan at the top of the table. According to our data, not everyone in the House follows President Donald Trump.\n\nFox News is ranked pretty high, as are insider news outlets Politico and The Hill. Perhaps most revealing here is the appearance of The Heritage Foundation, an all-powerful right-wing think tank.\n\nMost Followed Twitter Accounts By House Republicans Rank Screen Name R - House D - House 1 HouseGOP 169 28 2 GOPLeader 167 39 3 SpeakerRyan 162 58 4 realDonaldTrump 155 59 5 FoxNews 149 55 6 Heritage 147 10 7 politico 145 172 8 thehill 142 164 9 cathymcmorris 139 22 10 SteveScalise 139 26\n\nThe blue team is similarly obedient to its leaders, with Democrats following their leadership and their most recent president. The appearance of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is interesting: He\u2019s not in leadership, but he\u2019s chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, where much of the Russia investigation action takes place.\n\nMost Followed Twitter Accounts By House Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 BarackObama 184 32 2 HouseDemocrats 182 20 3 nytimes 172 105 4 politico 172 145 5 NancyPelosi 171 35 6 washingtonpost 170 129 7 AP 167 129 8 WhipHoyer 165 27 9 thehill 164 142 10 RepAdamSchiff 157 19\n\nThe divide also extends to the media.

The list of media figures followed by House Republicans looks a bit like the Fox News TV schedule, with the top account being the network\u2019s congressional correspondent.\n\nMost Followed Journalists By House Republicans Rank Screen Name R - House D - House 1 ChadPergram 132 113 2 BretBaier 117 38 3 seanhannity 109 10 4 DanaPerino 104 12 5 mikeallen 101 122 6 jaketapper 96 138 7 TuckerCarlson 95 10 8 megynkelly 93 20 9 chucktodd 90 146 10 IngrahamAngle 90 4\n\nThe Democrats, however, have also curated their follows along partisan lines, with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow in the No. 1 spot. The Democratic top-10 list also features Chuck Todd of MSNBC, Jake Tapper of CNN and Mike Allen of Politico. What is really striking is the disparity in numbers for some other journalists, like Ezra Klein and Nate Silver, whom some detractors might characterize as \u201cliberal.\u201d For example, as you can see in the table below, 119 Democrats \u2015 but only 37 (out of 199) Republicans \u2015 follow Silver of FiveThirtyEight. It\u2019s also interesting to note that despite Fox being\u2026 well, Fox, Chad Pergram is still clearly someone whom Democrats in the House are interested in hearing from.\n\nMost Followed Journalists By House Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 maddow 151 16 2 chucktodd 146 90 3 jaketapper 138 96 4 ezraklein 136 33 5 chrislhayes 129 20 6 mikeallen 122 101 7 NateSilver538 119 37 8 daveweigel 114 48 9 ChadPergram 113 132 10 mitchellreports 113 43\n\nThis, however, is just scratching the surface.\n\nFollow The Leader\n\nWe decided to see if the data could tell us anything about the 2020 Democratic primary. Perhaps Twitter follows by people in Congress could be a useful proxy for establishment support \u2015 in which case, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is narrowly leading the pack of potential presidential candidates, closely followed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren. (Note that some people are listed twice, as they have multiple Twitter accounts.)\n\nMost Followed 2020 Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 CoryBooker 138 13 2 SenWarren 137 9 3 SenGillibrand 136 19 4 JoeBiden 133 5 5 SenSanders 119 14 6 KamalaHarris 112 5 7 ewarren 91 5 8 BetoORourke 74 4 9 BernieSanders 70 6 10 SherrodBrown 11 2 11 gillibrandny 3 0\n\nIt\u2019s also fun to look at other individual accounts to see the breakdown of congressional followers. For example, here are the results for Katy Perry, who was one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most high-profile supporters in 2016 \u2015 she\u2019s followed by 22 House Democrats and one Republican:\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nTaylor Swift has more bipartisan appeal, and is followed by eight House Democrats and seven House Republicans:\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nThe ghost of culture wars past are still reflected on Twitter. Here\u2019s the follower breakdown for Chick-fil-A, which became a cause celebre for Republicans in 2012 after a top executive commented publicly on his opposition to same-sex marriage. (Sadly, no one in Congress appears to follow Gillette, so we couldn\u2019t surmise anything about its ongoing \u201ccontroversy.\u201d)\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nAnd now the best part. As we did last week, we\u2019ve built a widget so you can go through the data yourself. Enter the name of a Twitter account, and it\u2019ll show you how many Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate follow that account. There are over 70,000 accounts, so get going \u2015 and be sure to tweet us with the most interesting results you\u2019ve found.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-supporting-los-angeles-teachers-strike_us_5c3d2db6e4b0922a21d7dc4f": "Los Angeles public school teachers went on strike on Monday after 20 months of failed negotiations for higher pay, greater school funding and more support staff.\n\nUnlike many of the teacher strikes that gripped red states in 2018, the LA strike pits the massive United Teachers Los Angeles union against the Los Angeles Unified School District, which runs public schools in the city of Los Angeles and many surrounding communities. The labor dispute reflects a bitter Democratic Party rift on education policy that splits unions and their allies from proponents of charter schools, whose influence on the LA school board has helped precipitate the strike.\n\nA number of high-profile Democratic elected officials have nonetheless come out on the side of Los Angeles teachers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who announced her 2020 presidential campaign on Dec. 31, and Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who are expected to announce presidential bids soon.\n\nSome of the U.S. House\u2019s biggest progressive stars have also declared their support for the city\u2019s teachers union, with Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairs Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.), as well as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ro Khanna (Calif.) tweeting their solidarity.\n\nEven Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, a former secretary of labor, released a statement saying he stands with the striking teachers \u201cfighting for the children they teach to have the resources they need to achieve and flourish.\u201d\n\nConservatives have been slashing school funding for years and our children, our future, will suffer for it.\n\n\n\nI stand with #LAUSD teachers and with ALL teachers fighting for better funding, better pay and a better and brighter future for our children. https://t.co/QsjgF4ETuG \u2014 Rep.

In fact, some Democrats who want to diminish the clout of teachers unions, like former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, actually back the city\u2019s school district against the union.\n\nOf the 10 Democrats representing parts of the city of Los Angeles, Reps. Jimmy Gomez, Brad Sherman, Adam Schiff, Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, Ted Lieu and Tony C\u00e1rdenas have announced unequivocal support for the teachers union.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 30 years, teachers from the LA Unified School District are on strike, fighting for fair pay, smaller class sizes, and better resourced schools for our kids,\u201d Schiff said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we fail to support our public school teachers, we fail our students too.

Judy Chu (D-Calif.), who represents communities in Los Angeles County with students in the affected school district, said that as a former teacher, she knows the importance of \u201cproper resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so disappointed that there could not be an agreement reached before this strike,\u201d Chu said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\n\u201cBut as a former teacher myself, I know how critical it is to have the proper resources that will give every student the ability to succeed in their education,\u201d she added, noting the need for smaller class sizes, more nurses and mental health counselors for students, and fair wages for teachers.\n\nRep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, another Democratic representative of the nation\u2019s second-largest city, encouraged the two sides in the strike to \u201cfind common ground\u201d that accommodates students, their families and teachers.\n\nOther prominent California Democrats likewise urged conciliation.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D), who is rumored to be considering a presidential run, expressed his disappointment that talks had broken down between teachers and the school district.\n\n\u201cI strongly urge both parties to consider returning to the negotiating table for talks over the weekend for the sake of our children, our teachers, and our schools,\u201d he said on Friday as a strike loomed.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued a similar statement on Monday, lamenting that the \u201cimpasse is disrupting the lives of too many kids and their families.\u201d\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D), an outspoken supporter of public charter schools, which are a point of contention in ongoing labor talks, declared that \u201cboth sides need to come together,\u201d and argued that the state had resources the city lacked to improve school funding.\n\nHuffPost reached out to the remaining three House members from LA, as well as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). Castro and Gabbard have announced plans to run for president. Thus far, none of them has commented publicly on the matter.\n\nKevin de Le\u00f3n, the former California state Senate president who unsuccessfully challenged Feinstein from the left in November, met with striking teachers to express solidarity.

(That move, of course, comes with a tax break.)\n\nIs it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality? https://t.co/jEvoGVRbT9 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 23, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez herself has been gleefully returning fire on Twitter. \u201cIs it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality?\u201d she tweeted this week.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about the 29-year-old political wunderkind \u201cclapping back.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has done something even more remarkable with this tax thing \u2013 she\u2019s popularized a wonky tax idea that asks the rich to pay their fair share, ending years of gaslighting from conservatives and the wealthy, who\u2019ve tried to argue lowering taxes on high-income earners is good for everyone.\n\nOther progressive economic policies \u2013 think the $15 an hour minimum wage or Medicare for all \u2013 have captured the public\u2019s imagination over the past few years. But it\u2019s hard to think of a progressive economic idea that has caught fire as quickly as this one, said Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University, who advised Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPart of that has to do with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s undeniable star power.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something unique about her in this moment where she\u2019s captured the attention of so many people on the left and the right,\u201d said Kelton. \u201cSo when she says something like this it just makes a splash.\u201d\n\nThe idea of raising the marginal rate to 70 percent isn\u2019t new. Sen. Sanders talked about raising taxes on the rich during his campaign, though it arguably wasn\u2019t his most resonant pitch.\n\nIn fact, from 1936 to 1980, the top rate never dipped below 70 percent. That changed with former President Ronald Reagan, who rode a wave of anti-tax backlash that has grown stronger with each year since, culminating when Congress passed Trump\u2019s tax cut in 2017.\n\nThe fantasy that these cuts would benefit ordinary Americans is largely over, said Kelton.\n\n\u201cThe policies of the last several decades going back to at least 1981 have largely decimated what was once the American dream, hollowing out communities, the middle class,\u201d she said, adding that people are now unable to afford what was once considered \u201cthe essentials\u201d: healthcare and housing.\n\nThough unemployment is at record lows, ordinary Americans are feeling anxious in the face of ballooning student debt, increasingly out-of-reach real estate and the prospect of affording a secure retirement.\n\n\u201cThose anxieties are deep and very really and were ignored,\u201d Kelton said.\n\nTrump tapped into that anxiety with his rhetoric, but not his policy. Ocasio-Cortez is doing both.\n\nShe\u2019s also managed to explain marginal tax rates to the millions of Americans who likely didn\u2019t understand the concept.\n\nSlavery is when your owner takes 100% of your production.\n\nDemocrat congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez wants 70% (according to CNN)\n\nWhat is the word for 70% expropriation? \u2014 Grover Norquist (@GroverNorquist) January 5, 2019\n\nWhile some conservatives have attempted to portray a 70 percent rate as the equivalent of you make $10 million and you pay $7 million in taxes, that\u2019s grossly incorrect. (Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist took that rationale to a wildly absurd place earlier this month, with the above tweet.) It is only the first dollar over $10 million that would be taxed at the higher rate.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has patiently explained the concept to the country again and again. Most recently in an appearance on the \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert.\n\n\u201cThis has been a chance to educate people,\u201d said Dean Baker, senior economist at the professor Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cThe confusion about marginal tax rates is pervasive.\u201d\n\nVoters, who get the concept, like the idea of raising rates. A survey conducted earlier this month found a majority of voters support raising the rate. Even hard-right conservative Ann Coulter is on board.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there just aren\u2019t many Americans who earn more than $10 million in income a year. An estimated 16,000 taxpayers would be subject to the higher tax bracket.\n\nWhile some conservatives argue that raising taxes on multimillionaires\u2019 income would lead them to work more and \u201ccreate less,\u201d there isn\u2019t much evidence to support that idea. And several prestigious economists have written about and support her plan.\n\nStill, Ocasio-Cortez hasn\u2019t fleshed out the details, so it\u2019s not clear if she intends to also raise taxes on \u201cunearned income,\u201d the money rich people earn from their investments.\n\nSome progressive economists believe that raising the marginal rate would just be part of the way to start getting the wealthy to pay their fair share. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea then is a signal of a larger ethos that\u2019s taking hold and likely part of a bigger plan to shift economic burdens to the well off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she probably has this in mind as her singular way of addressing income and wealth inequality,\u201d Kelton said.\n\nThe billionaires freaking out likely understand that the popularity of this idea is a flashing warning sign: The jig is up.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-presidential-exploratory-committee_us_5c37a3e1e4b0c469d76c52f0": "NEW YORK \u2015 Sen.

The decision has also triggered backlash from the U.S. security establishment, including the resignation of top officials like former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.\n\nWhether to withdraw from the conflicts and how to do so without creating more chaos is also likely to come up repeatedly in Democratic primary debates and be a key element of candidates\u2019 foreign policy platforms. But since only three of the declared or potential 2020 candidates \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) \u2014 have publicly commented on Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw, HuffPost contacted a dozen potential candidates to clarify their foreign policy approaches toward Afghanistan and Syria and ask whether they support pulling U.S. forces out.\n\nHere are their responses:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): Troops should withdraw, but not the way Trump is doing it.\n\n\u201cU.S. troops should be withdrawn from [Syria] and Afghanistan, but in a planned and coordinated way,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost in an email. \u201cThis must be combined with a serious diplomatic and political strategy which helps deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sudden decision to pull out of Syria and the resulting confusion among allies was more evidence of his administration\u2019s \u201cerratic and reckless approach,\u201d according to Sanders.\n\nAlthough Sanders holds that Syrian dictator Bashar Assad must not remain in power and has perpetrated crimes against humanity, the senator said he wants a diplomatic approach with Russia and Iran to resolve the conflict. (He did not explain how he would convince Assad\u2019s two biggest guarantors to give up their support for the dictator.)\n\nU.S. troops should be withdrawn from [Syria] and Afghanistan, but in a planned and coordinated way. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nOn Afghanistan, Sanders called for an orderly end to the intervention and noted U.S. troops have been in the country for nearly 18 years. But he also rejected fully walking away from U.S. commitments abroad.\n\n\u201cIn both Afghanistan and Syria, withdrawing troops does not mean withdrawing all involvement, and we should stay politically engaged in these countries and do whatever we can to help them build governments and economies that are responsible to their people,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.): Trump\u2019s withdrawal is reckless, but no comment on whether U.S. forces should leave.\n\n\u201cSenator Booker believes that President Trump\u2019s immediate and unplanned withdrawal of troops from Syria is reckless and dangerous. Unfortunately, the withdrawal is part of Trump\u2019s larger chaotic and directionless foreign policy approach to Syria that includes freezing \u2013 and ultimately withdrawing \u2013 much-needed stabilization funding,\u201d a spokesperson for Booker said in an email.\n\n\u201cThis fly-by-night foreign policy approach has blindsided the President\u2019s own national security team, stoked fear and confusion among our allies, and risks seriously harming our efforts to achieve an enduring defeat of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for Booker did not respond when asked to clarify the senator\u2019s own position on whether he would support a withdrawal of forces from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.): Diplomacy cannot be through tweets.\n\nIn a statement Monday to reporters at Howard University in Washington, D.C., Harris, who announced her intention to join the 2020 presidential race earlier in the day, rebuked the current White House on its foreign policy strategy but did not specifically mention Syria and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that we cannot conduct foreign policy through tweets,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMy concern is that when we make decisions about what we will do in terms of our military presence, much less our diplomatic priorities, that we do that in a way that will involve consultation with our military leaders, in a way that will involve some kind consultation or at least outreach to our allies, and that when we make those decisions, the American public can have a better sense of confidence that it is the right decision. So, as much as anything, I\u2019m concerned by the process by which the president has gone about doing what he has done.\u201d\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio): Troops should withdraw, but not the way Trump is doing it.\n\n\u201cI support an organized withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan that is coordinated with our allies and well planned with the input of both the State Department and the Department of Defense,\u201d Brown told HuffPost in an email.\n\n\u201cI do not support President Trump using our troops for his own political gain by making announcements without talking to his own cabinet officials, let alone our partners on the ground.\u201d\n\nBrown criticized Trump as unwilling to stand up to Russia in both the Middle East and Ukraine, and said the deaths of four U.S. servicemen in an ISIS attack in Syria this week \u201cunderscores the need for a broader conversation about our presence in the region.\u201d\n\nI support an organized withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan that is coordinated with our allies and well planned. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio)\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): Troops should withdraw, but not the way Trump is doing it.\n\nWarren was one of the few likely Democratic candidates to publicly speak at length about the pullouts in Syria and Afghanistan following Trump\u2019s withdrawal announcement. In an interview with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow earlier this month, Warren said she supported withdrawing troops from both Syria and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI think that everybody who keeps saying, \u2018No, no, no, we can\u2019t do that,\u2019 in the defense establishment needs to explain what they think winning in those wars [looks] like and where the metrics are,\u201d Warren said.\n\nBut Warren criticized Trump for tweeting the withdrawal order and not coordinating with allies on how to pull back troops in a way that would ensure safety and stability. Warren also gave a speech before the announcement in late November at American University, calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and called for re-evaluating current U.S. military deployments.\n\nWhen HuffPost contacted Warren for comment on her policies toward Syria and Afghanistan, as well as if she supported a total troop withdrawal, a spokesperson referenced Warren\u2019s university speech and MSNBC interview.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.): Trump\u2019s withdrawal is too sudden and poorly executed.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News shortly after Trump\u2019s Syria announcement, Klobuchar criticized the president for not listening to the advice of the military and called the chaotic nature of the withdrawal a disaster for allies.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think you pull out suddenly and do this to your allies, and especially to the Kurds who we trained to fight for us and who are going to be sitting ducks there,\u201d Klobuchar told Fox News. She added, \u201cthere\u2019s got to be a better way to do this.\u201d\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii): Trump is right to leave Syria; no comment on Afghanistan withdrawal\n\nGabbard also did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but following Trump\u2019s withdrawal order, she tweeted, \u201cWe need to get out of Syria ASAP in a responsible manner (it shouldn\u2019t take long).\u201d In her tweets, Gabbard also said there was a \u201chysterical reaction\u201d to the withdrawal and claimed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was pushing for war and regime change in Iran and Syria.\n\nGabbard is a longtime apologist for Bashar Assad, even meeting with him in 2017, and has been heavily critical of U.S. intelligence linking him to crimes such as deadly chemical attacks in Syria.\n\nWe need to get out of Syria ASAP in a responsible manner (it shouldn\u2019t take long). Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii)\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.): Withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq\n\nGillibrand did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Five days after HuffPost initially reached out to her, however, Gillibrand told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC that she supported withdrawing troops.\n\n\u201cI think we should be drawing down our troops, not only in Afghanistan but the remainder in Iraq and in Syria,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cThen give Congress the opportunity that if they believe we should be in combat missions in any of these countries that we actually file a new authorization for the military use of force.\u201d\n\nGillibrand also criticized Trump\u2019s actions as capitulating to Russia and isolating traditional allies.\n\nThe following Democrats have made no public statements on the withdrawals, and did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment:\n\nRep. John Delaney (D-Md.)\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Julian Castro\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas)", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-byrd-democrats-civility_us_5b3a935fe4b07b827cb9bd89": "JIM WATSON via Getty Images \"To negotiate with such people, to treat them as colleagues and friends, to accept this as a normal partisan disagreement is to validate this grotesque hypocrisy.\"\n\nDemocratic politicians have a seemingly endless well of good faith for their Republican colleagues. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and even Bernie Sanders all speak with the language of decency, full of assurances that Republicans will be heard, understood and engaged. They offer appeals to morality, norms and shared values as if saying it often enough will make it true.\n\nBut there is no salvaging the Republican Party. Its leaders are beyond shame, beyond rules, beyond reason. Democrats can speak in the dialogue of peace, but the only dialect Republicans understand is power.\n\nIn the face of an unspeakable atrocity on our southern border \u2015 constructed, announced and implemented by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, this Republican-led Congress does nothing and leverages none of its authority as a co-equal branch of government. Despite years of rhetoric about family values and shining cities on hills, the Republican Party allowed and tacitly condoned separating, perhaps irreparably, asylum seekers from the very children they fled here to save. Then, with more than 2,000 children still stranded away from their parents, they went on vacation.\n\nTo negotiate with such people, to treat them as colleagues and friends, to accept this as a normal partisan disagreement is to validate this grotesque hypocrisy.\n\nThis is what it means to give good-faith scoldings about civility when the barest hint of power is turned against those who constantly wield it as a weapon. This paradigm renders civil disobedience in the face of abuse outside the bounds of society. It civilizes lying daily for the purpose of obfuscating the sins and crimes the federal executive is committing against his own population. That the previous sentence makes sense is a tragedy, yet it is a greater calamity that both national parties are defending the order of a world in which it is true.\n\nIf Democrats are to change the course of events, they will need to process that they, like all of us, have been utterly betrayed.\n\nThe Republican Party has gotten much out of this arrangement: a compliant press; an intractable base, and a consolidation of power heretofore unseen in U.S. politics. What benefits have accrued to the Democrats from all their pleasantry and open-mindedness? They have received nothing but scorn. Republicans have spent years savaging Democratic constituents, attacking their cities, towns and cultures, denying them resources and abrogating their rights.\n\nPredictably, without any restraints placed upon them, Republicans have begun shaping the law and its interpretation in their favor at an alarming rate. Senate leadership, embodied by Mitch McConnell, prevented a hearing on a nominee for the Supreme Court not due to qualifications or extremism, but simply because proceeding with established norms would not serve Republican goals.\n\nWhen it still appeared that Hillary Clinton would win the White House and control of the government would remain split, arguments were forwarded that the court simply did not need nine members. After years of their own obstruction, Republicans have ended the courtesy of blue slips, a veto on judicial nominees from senators\u2019 home states. As a result, judicial nominations have gone through at an extraordinary pace on all except the most visibly unqualified nominees.\n\nDemocrats, by refusing to defend their authority to govern on behalf of their constituents and prioritizing the sentiments and responses of Republican voters, have sacrificed the instruments of power for the perception of principle. Continuing this strategy is to misunderstand this moment in history. The Republican Party has already conceded to its extremism, codified it and entrenched it. There is no political no norm it will not break, no kindness or tolerance its leaders will reciprocate. They do not believe in government by the people, for the people, but in government by Republicans for Republicans. To accommodate them is only to empower them.\n\nLeah Millis / Reuters\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive that the only means of saving democracy is to jettison the civility and standards that lay at its foundations. But this mistakes civility as the source of good in democracy and not the product of a system that sees and protects the equality of its citizens. The former view \u2015 seeing empathy, reciprocity and mutual respect as ends in and of themselves rather than tools of consensus and understanding \u2015 only leaves the door open for abuse from those who have no interest either.\n\nIf Democrats are to change the course of events, they will need to process that they, like all of us, have been utterly betrayed.\n\nIt will be difficult. It will make our politics feel more rancorous, more hostile, less conciliatory. But it would be wrong for the Democrats to seek reconciliation while the Republican Party organizes government to recognize only its ideology as legitimate, systematically assaults Democratic constituents and actively condones the abandonment of international law and the heinous human rights abuses still happening to thousands of asylum-seekers.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-green-new-deal_us_5c1415ffe4b05d7e5d81f322": "Sen.

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a potential 2020 contender, was among the first in the Senate to endorse the effort.\n\nThe proposal breaks the boundaries of the last three decades of debate over climate change, shifting from policies focused on the need to tweak markets by putting a price on carbon emissions to large-scale federal intervention the likes of which the United States hasn\u2019t pursued in decades.\n\nJustin Sullivan via Getty Images A search and rescue crew member searches for human remains at a mobile home park that was destroyed by the Camp Fire in California last month.\n\nClimate change went largely ignored during the 2016 presidential election. In the years since, the crisis of human-caused global warming became disturbingly tangible as record-breaking storms and wildfires killed thousands and destroyed property worth hundreds of billions of dollars. In an ironic twist, President Donald Trump\u2019s bellicose denial of the scientific realities of human-caused global warming, rollbacks of greenhouse gas regulations and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords helped propel the issue into mainstream political discourse.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear what a Green New Deal would entail, but the key point is to eliminate net emissions by 2030. That\u2019s the deadline by which world governments must halve global emissions to keep the planet from warming by 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit, scientists at the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change determined in October. Climate change is forecast to be cataclysmic beyond that temperature.\n\nThe other core pillar is using the rapid build up of renewable and energy-efficiency infrastructure to reduce unemployment and under-employment, and provide funding to transition workers in fossil fuel industries into new jobs and aid communities sickened and impoverished by the oil, gas and coal pollution.\n\nIn April, Booker announced legislation to lay the groundwork for a federal jobs guarantee \u2015 a policy first proposed in the 1930s under the original New Deal. On Friday, he indicated that such a policy would serve as a vehicle for a Green New Deal.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that any politician who wants to be taken seriously by our generation needs to have the courage to stand up to the fossil fuel billionaires and back a Green New Deal. Varshini Prakash, co-founder of Sunrise Movement\n\nBooker\u2019s record on environmental issues is strong. As the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, he established the city\u2019s first environmental commission and Office of Sustainability and contracted energy-efficiency retrofits on city buildings to a union that specializes in green construction. In the Senate, Booker pushed to extend tax credits on renewable energy, fought offshore drilling and seismic testing and was one of only 10 senators to attend the Paris climate talks in 2015. In October 2017, he introduced a bill to require federal agencies to address environmental justice issues in low-income and ethnically marginalized communities.\n\nThe nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters scored him at 100 percent last year and 98 percent over his lifetime on its ranking, which is based on how lawmakers vote.\n\nBooker has been criticized for accepting donations from major corporate players, including the pharmaceutical giants based in his state and the finance, insurance and real estate industries that make up the bulk of his campaign fundraising. But, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the energy and natural resources industries contributed about $331,000 to him between 2013 and 2018, less than half of which came from corporate political action committees.\n\n\u201cCory Booker taking this step is huge for our movement and huge for the Democratic Party,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that helped lead Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s winning primary campaign.

They\u2019ve been standing around the front of Bethel AME Church in their \u201cAndrew Gillum for governor\u201d tees for about an hour. When they see Gillum striding toward them, they erupt into raucous applause. He immediately scoops up Jett Williams, a precocious 2-year-old sitting in a wagon and sporting a Florida A&M University football jersey, initiating the first of many photo ops that Saturday in early October.\n\nGillum, 39, has barely handed Jett back to the boy\u2019s mother, Kay Harper Williams, before a group of people in \u201cBlack Voters Matter\u201d shirts rush up to him with their arms extended and their camera apps open. He stretches out his arms and flashes a bright smile that quickly becomes a warm chuckle.\n\nSee, it\u2019s homecoming, y\u2019all. And Gillum is a fixture of FAMU\u2019s homecoming parade. They love him here, not in the way that fans love a celebrity or adherents love their leader. It\u2019s simpler than that \u2014 something like a mother doting on a long-lost son. Except that Gillum is at home here. He served on the Tallahassee City Commission from 2003 to 2014 before he was elected mayor, a position he has held since. He\u2019s a Rattler, having graduated from the university in 2003. This is his element.\n\nAround here, Gillum needs no introduction, and he don\u2019t meet no strangers. These are his talents. He is at home everywhere, and everywhere he is loved like someone who finally came home.\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost Every facet of his platform, Gillum says, is rooted in his life.\n\nA few weeks ago, something miraculous happened in American politics. A black politician called a white politician a racist and got away with it. A black man called a white man a racist in public, on live television, and he did it so deftly, and he so discombobulated the other guy, that people forgot to accuse him of playing the race card.\n\nTo be sure, Gillum technically didn\u2019t call his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, a racist during their second debate. That was the political genius of the riff. Later, a campaign staffer told me Gillum cribbed the concluding line from a pastor with whom he spoke about two weeks before the debate. It was strategic, and Gillum was prepared to use it. How could he not? This was oppo from God.\n\nLet me back up, though. The context is important. From the surprising moment in August when Gillum grabbed the Democratic nomination, making him the first black major-party gubernatorial candidate in Florida\u2019s history, racism became the fulcrum of the election. This was certainly not Gillum\u2019s desire when he launched his bid for governor; his people are at pains to say his campaign is not explicitly about race. Endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Gillum is running on a straightforward populist platform: Medicare-for-all, hiking the minimum wage, boosting Florida\u2019s corporate tax rate.\n\nBut then DeSantis told Florida voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum. And then voters began receiving robocalls from a neo-Nazi group in Idaho. In the call, a man pretends to be Gillum and says in a stereotypically exaggerated dialect over drums and jungle noises, \u201cWe Negroes \u2026 done made mud huts while white folk waste a bunch of time making their home out of wood an\u2019 stone.\u201d The speaker also falsely claims that Gillum will pass a law allowing black people to escape arrest \u201cif the Negro know fo\u2019 sho he didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnd then a GOP official from the Orlando area posted a meme falsely claiming that Gillum will issue reparations for African enslavement. And then, stumping for DeSantis on Oct. 6, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) accused Gillum of overseeing a rise in crime in Tallahassee, dubbing him \u201cAndrew Kill \u2019Em.\u201d (In September the Leon County sheriff said violent crime has dropped since Gillum has been in office.)\n\nAnd then a second robocall went out from the same group, once again featuring a man pretending to be Gillum and speaking in an exaggerated dialect, this one with Negro spirituals interlaced with monkey screeches in the background as the narrator muses that using chicken feet as medicine is what would keep Gillum\u2019s health plan cheap.\n\nThe election had become a local production of America\u2019s ongoing psychodrama about race. During the candidates\u2019 second debate on Oct. 24, the moderator began winding his way through a question regarding DeSantis\u2019 \u201cmonkey this up\u201d statement and why he made four appearances at events hosted by a white nationalist. But before the moderator could finish, DeSantis lashed out, declaring that he wouldn\u2019t let the media smear him and he wouldn\u2019t take anything from Gillum.\n\nTo this, Gillum dropped his head and chuckled, and then he put home what will go down as an iconic slam dunk. \u201cWell, let me first say, my grandmother used to say, \u2018A hit dog will holler.\u2019 And it hollered through this room. Mr. DeSantis has spoken. First of all, he\u2019s got neo-Nazis helping him out in the state. He has spoken at racist conferences. He\u2019s accepted a contribution and would not return it from someone who referred to the former president of the United States as a Muslim n-i-g-g-e-r,\u201d Gillum said, spelling out the slur once tweeted by Steven Alembik in reference to Barack Obama. \u201cWhen asked to return that money, he said no. He\u2019s using that money to now fund negative ads.\u201d\n\nAnd here came the coup de grace, the line the pastor handed him. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\u201d Gillum said, shooting his eyebrows skyward and nodding. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\n\nIt was a perfect formulation, suggesting both a fluency and an impatience with how the political and media culture typically handles accusations of racism. Black candidates operate in a bind. They can\u2019t call out racism because the minute they do, they\u2019ll be accused of playing the race card, of responding emotionally to attacks based in the denial of their humanity. Had he gone directly after DeSantis and bluntly called him a racist, Gillum might have expected several weeks\u2019 worth of tortured coverage: Is DeSantis truly a racist? There would be testimonials from his side, black friends of DeSantis\u2019 deposited in front of cameras and microphones, counteraccusations that his opponent was making too much of race, and in turn, Gillum would be pressed to qualify his statement.\n\nBut Gillum avoided the trap. People responded to it as if it were a sports highlight. When I first saw it, I laughed and said \u201cOh, shit!\u201d as if I had just watched Allen Iverson step over Tyronn Lue for the first time. Gillum was smooth up there too, rolling into the line instead of snapping it off in the hammy way that politicians often do.\n\n\u201cWhat happens too often happens to black people in a role such as his is that you find that you have to be twice as prepared, you have to toe the line more than anyone else but that you\u2019re carrying your people on your shoulders,\u201d said Cynthia Moore Chestnut, a former member of the Florida House of Representatives and now the chairwoman of the Alachua County Democratic Party. \u201cSo you can\u2019t afford not to be prepared, not to seize the moment. You have to because you\u2019re representing more than yourself.\n\n\u201cBut you know, we have to walk on water. We have to walk on water.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost \u201cIt was energizing, and I\u2019m honored that somebody wants to take a picture,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cIt\u2019s not work for me.\u201d\n\nBy 8:57 a.m. on the day of FAMU\u2019s homecoming parade, Gillum has greeted at least a hundred people. He hasn\u2019t broken a sweat. Every person gets the best version of Gillum that he has to offer. He stops to greet a woman sitting on the side of the road watching the parade. He holds her hand as she shouts out that she\u2019s praying for him and his wife, R. Jai Gillum.\n\nThe scene charges up Andrew Gillum\u2019s entourage. They start chanting their campaign slogan, \u201cBring it home, Andrew! Bring it home!\u201d He stops again to photograph one of his campaign staffers and another member of the black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha, the latter woman wearing a \u201cPretty girls for Gillum\u201d shirt. He pushes the importance of voting while conversing with a woman on her Instagram live. He frequently leaves his designated spot behind the car guiding his path through the parade to interact with onlookers \u2014 a maneuver that causes one member of his entourage to gently guide him back to his spot. Defiantly, Gillum jogs to the other side of the road to do it all over again.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not going to the people, they\u2019re running to him. They have their cameras in their hand, ready to take photos and shake hands with the man they believe will be the next governor of Florida. While this may seem exhausting to some, Gillum meets everyone with open arms and says he doesn\u2019t mind the onslaught of attention.\n\n\u201cIt was energizing, and I\u2019m honored that somebody wants to take a picture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not work for me.\u201d\n\nThis love for people was a gift from his father, Charles Gillum. He worked in construction, and when things were slow, he and a young Andrew would sell fruit on a corner, back when no one cared to take Andrew\u2019s photo. On the street, watching his father look his customers in the eye, Andrew learned an early lesson in what you might call retail politics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d loop people in personally. \u2018What\u2019s going on? How\u2019s such and such?\u2019 That kind of thing. And then they\u2019d leave buying stuff they didn\u2019t think they needed because my dad had hooked them in,\u201d Andrew Gillum says with a laugh. \u201cBut he loves people, and that love for people passes on. It\u2019s not new to me.\u201d\n\nFrom his mama, Frances Gillum, and her people, he got the habits of selflessness you tend to find in church mothers in un-air-conditioned Southern Baptist chapels after service. She is from Clyattville, a small town right outside Valdosta, Georgia, and tucked deep into the state\u2019s farm belt, where Southern hospitality is law. \u201cI remember my grandmother, if she had nothing in the refrigerator ... [and] people came over, somehow she was making something. And it was always good,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019d make something out of nothing. But that\u2019s what you do for folks when they come by to see you. When they take interest in you, you do what you can to accommodate.\u201d\n\nChestnut remembers Andrew Gillum as a teenager living in Gainesville, Florida. He was best friends with her son, Chris. After school, Gillum and other students would head over to Chestnut\u2019s house to chill. While the others were out front eating pizza, Gillum would be in the kitchen, helping her prepare food or talking.\n\n\u201cHe was always the helper. My son said that they called him \u2018the principal\u2019 because he was the one in class always prepared, ready with the agenda, with whatever needed to happen. He believes in being prepared,\u201d she says. (If there was a hint of an insult in the nickname other kids assigned to him, it hasn\u2019t lived on in the anecdote\u2019s telling.) \u201cIt said a lot to me about the kind of person he was \u2014 and he is.\u201d\n\nHis politics flow out of his personality. Every facet of his platform, Gillum says, is rooted in his life. When he talks about health care, he recalls those all-day waits at the free dental clinic to have his teeth cleaned as a child. He remembers believing that\u2019s the way things worked \u2014 you went, and you waited your turn. He stumps for increasing teacher pay because of educators who saw something in him worth saving.\n\nGillum fights for LGBTQ equality because he has a gay sibling who packed up and left for California, he says, \u201cjust so that he could be himself.\u201d Cliff Thaell, a former Leon County commissioner-at-large, recalls Gillum speaking to a crowd at First Presbyterian Church in Tallahassee after the Pulse shooting in Orlando in 2016.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was able to take all that pain and express that we were going to stand up to that kind of terrorism, that kind of bullying, to the NRA, but he put it in a personal context,\u201d says Thaell. \u201cHe was able to take that incident and put it in the most personal of terms and share it with a large crowd of people and help us feel his pain \u2014 and his leadership, his vision.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Gillum\u2019s approach to criminal justice reform \u2014 including bail reform, restoration of voting rights and \u201cban the box\u201d measures, which would prohibit asking on job applications whether applicants have a criminal record \u2014 was informed by his siblings\u2019 experience. Three of his brothers have had run-ins with the law. His older brother Patrick Gillum was accused of burglary and assault in 1991. A few months later, he was sentenced to a year in jail for cocaine possession. That year, 17-year-old Chuck Gillum was charged with armed robbery and sentenced as an adult. Patrick Gillum took plea deals because he couldn\u2019t afford to post bail, and both brothers had a hard time finding work after their release. In 1999, Chuck Gillum was sentenced to 15 years in prison for trafficking just under a pound of cocaine. In 2006, Eric Gillum was sentenced to four years for burglary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not somebody\u2019s talking point,\u201d says Andrew Gillum of his criminal justice platform. \u201cThat\u2019s what I believe. And it\u2019s shaped by the fact that I\u2019ve seen how this thing plays out and how it works.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost Gillum's slogan, \"Bring it home,\" is based in an ideal instilled in him by his maternal grandmother.\n\nElla Baker Jackson, Gillum\u2019s maternal grandmother, was the only child in her family to attend grade school. She, like many black kids who were fortunate enough to attend school in the early days of Jim Crow, was instructed to bring home what she had learned in class so she could educate the rest of the family. She instilled the same notion in Gillum.\n\n\u201cI can still hear my grandmother\u2019s voice,\u201d he says in a campaign ad from September. \u201cShe said, \u2018Go to school, mind your teachers, get your lesson. And one day, bring your education home.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBring it home\u201d is now his campaign slogan. Too little has been said of the role memaws play in shaping the politics of black folk. I\u2019m serious. Grandmothers are a kind of government unto themselves in the black community, at once a legislature, an executive and a judiciary. It\u2019s one-party rule, tough but fair, a whole benevolent system of social control running on anecdote and aphorism (\u201cA hit dog gon\u2019 always holler,\u201d my Muss would always say.)\n\nBlack grandmothers might be affectionate and nurturing, but there\u2019s nothing soft about their job, which is to raise their grandkids to be impenetrable. They ensure that you know how to handle all the racist ills that will inevitably be thrown your way. They\u2019ve been where you\u2019re trying to go \u2015 so they hip you to how folks will try to discredit your intellect and your experiences. They reaffirm your blackness. They guide you through what it means to be black in this country. They teach you what it means to demand respect as a black person and that no bit of disrespect is too small to raise hell over.\n\nThey lay a foundation in their grandkids for a moral self, which is what becomes a political self.\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost \u201cI don\u2019t think people are looking for perfect. They\u2019re looking for real,\u201d says Gillum.\n\nDuring my day following him around Tallahassee, I realized something about Gillum. He is black black. He is openly and proudly black in a way rarely seen in politics, which tend to prefer a blackness that\u2019s been modulated by white institutions. He grew up poor in South Miami-Dade County. He has multiple family members who have cycled through the criminal justice system. He attended a historically black university. He\u2019s black in the big things and the small ones. At a Congressional Black Caucus Week forum in September, I noticed him pointing at his interlocutor and popping his hand back \u2014 black semaphore for \u201cI heard what you said, and I agree.\u201d He frequently employs African-American vernacular in a natural way. It\u2019s not an empty attempt to connect with black voters who aren\u2019t black like he is. It\u2019s just how he talks. And while blackness is by no means a monolith, Gillum represents a kind of blackness that is commonplace in black life and basically nonexistent in high-level American politics.\n\nHis campaign is an exercise in recasting populism in a black idiom. In political terms, this manifests as a friendly pragmatism. \u201cWe\u2019re running a campaign that is historic in nature but that is practical in its goals,\u201d says one campaign staffer. \u201cThe things that he wants to do are going to help a whole lot of white people. He said that in church \u2026 and everyone laughed. But it\u2019s true, and everyone knows it, and we don\u2019t want to lose sight of that.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s political message has remained the same in predominantly white, conservative Baker County as in Democratic stronghold Miami-Dade.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people are looking for perfect. They\u2019re looking for real,\u201d says Gillum. \u201cDonald Trump ain\u2019t perfect. In fact, he\u2019s far from it. He\u2019s, I think, unqualified for the office. But he tapped into something that was real for people, and they rewarded him with their support.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost Andrew Gillum and his wife, R. Jai Gillum, at the FAMU homecoming parade. He\u2019s a Rattler, having graduated from the university in 2003.\n\nIt\u2019s 9:30 a.m. now, and the procession is nearing Bragg Stadium. The crowd up this way is thicker, louder.\n\nWhen Gillum and company round the corner, onlookers let out a roar similar to what you hear when the Rattlers score a touchdown. A little boy who has spotted Gillum shouts, \u201cIt\u2019s Andrew Gillum!\u201d before darting out to meet the mayor. A few steps down the road, a little girl alerts her mother to Gillum\u2019s arrival: \u201cThere he go, Mama! There he go!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what I hear the most in the crowd: variations of \u201cThere he go!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he go, right here!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere go the man!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat just makes us all so proud here,\u201d says Castillo Mitchell, a 22-year-old senior at FAMU and the owner of Flex My Complexion. \u201cAnd just the motivation that it gives us as students \u2026 letting you know that when you come to FAMU, you could go anywhere.\u201d\n\nSays Kay Harper Williams, the mother of 2-year-old Jett, \u201cHope seems clich\u00e9, but I think it definitely puts in perspective what it is that my son can accomplish.\u201d\n\nPolls show that Gillum is locked in a tight race. During the Democratic primary, his campaign drew from his grandmother\u2019s lesson: Even when he didn\u2019t see anything useful lying around, he found a way to make something out of nothing. He beat out more-established and better-funded white candidates to drive the highest turnout in the state\u2019s four most populous counties \u2014 Duval, Orange, Broward and Miami-Dade. These counties also have the highest percentage of black voters. Gillum spent a mere $4 million, compared with the $90 million spent by his opponents. He raised only $6 million. The game plan was pure retail politics.\n\n\u201cThe most dehumanizing part of my day was call time,\u201d he says, shifting his eyes downward for the first time during our conversation, \u201cbecause I knew we weren\u2019t going to raise any money. And I was going to be rejected God knows how many times in that one day. And I just told the team, \u2018Look, this is not getting us anything. Not to mention, it\u2019s beating me down a little bit. I need to get out and talk to people.\u2019\n\n\u201cI kept believing that if we can get to people, if we can get to voters, if we can get into that auditorium or that living room or that space, I could introduce myself, and we will make it work. And so that\u2019s what it became about.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot of, let\u2019s say, audacity in his confidence. He is certain he can walk into a room and tap into the depths of what people need from their elected officials. It is breathtaking.\n\n\u201cWhen it was determined that this was what we were going to do, then we were going to do it. And, like I said, this was nothing but my faith,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThat being said, we\u2019ve got to be ready, and we got to work, and we can\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd the beauty of this all is that we decided \u2014 my wife and I both \u2014 when we were going to do this, that we were going to run this race our way and we\u2019d run it by being us. There\u2019s no sense in running for an office as big as this trying to perpetrate somebody that you\u2019re not. My grandmother was like, \u2018Look, son, if you tell the truth, you don\u2019t have to worry about telling enough lies. You just tell the truth.\u2019\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost \u201cThis got laid on my heart. I didn\u2019t seek it,\u201d said Gillum of his historic run for governor. \u201cSo all I had to do was be disciplined to it.\"\n\nIn 2015 three men with grandiose plans to redevelop Tallahassee parachuted into the city. Mike Miller, Mike Sweets and Brian Butler began scheduling meetings and attending gatherings with the best-connected people in City Hall, spending months getting tight with city officials.\n\nBut the businessmen were actually undercover FBI agents investigating whether developers were influencing city projects. One lobbyist of particular interest was Adam Corey, a former close friend of Gillum\u2019s. (Gillum has since cut ties with Corey.) In 2016, Corey introduced Miller to Gillum. One meeting of the three men, which took place at a restaurant Corey had developed with taxpayer funds, made headlines because it was scheduled while Corey and Gillum were on vacation with other city lobbyists in Costa Rica. Gillum has said that he didn\u2019t talk about business while he was there and that he paid for his portion of the trip. Corey\u2019s attorney has said otherwise.\n\nA separate investigation by the Florida Commission on Ethics centers on a 2016 trip Andrew Gillum took to New York with his brother Marcus Gillum, Corey and Miller. Emails show that Corey informed Andrew Gillum that Miller had arranged lodging, a trip to a Mets game and a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty. Gillum didn\u2019t attend the Mets game and instead went to a performance of \u201cHamilton.\u201d He says he paid for his trip, but recent texts released from Corey\u2019s attorney indicate that Miller might have covered the tickets. (Although in the grand scheme of politics, \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets are low ball.)\n\nThe FBI probe has resulted in a number of subpoenas name-dropping numerous city officials and insiders. Gillum is not among them.\n\nDespite the lack of charges and despite Gillum\u2019s protestations that FBI agents have assured him he is not the subject of their investigation, the case has lingered. One reason is that corruption has racial valences dating at least as far back as Reconstruction, when the figure of the crooked black politician became a powerful stereotype.\n\nDeSantis and his supporters stop just short of making subtext the text. An October TV ad from the Republican Party of Florida pieces together misleading sound bites from news reporters to back the narrator\u2019s false claim that Gillum is involved in an active criminal investigation and is \u201crunning from the FBI.\u201d Just the other day, President Donald Trump, an avid DeSantis supporter, accused Gillum of being a \u201cthief.\u201d\n\nBetween the corruption talk \u2014 from politicians who are not exactly goo-goos \u2014 and the more straightforward racist political attacks, it\u2019s not hard to see what Gillum\u2019s opponents are driving at. \u201cWe know that the threatening black man \u2026 [has] persisted in our culture for hundreds of years, and they\u2019re employing that,\u201d one campaign staffer tells HuffPost. \u201cThere\u2019s a genetic memory in the population that\u2019s susceptible to these sort of images, these sorts of tones.\u201d\n\nChestnut points to Gillum\u2019s direct interactions with DeSantis during the state\u2019s two gubernatorial debates, during which DeSantis continually referred to Gillum \u2014 a sitting mayor of the capital \u2014 as \u201cAndrew.\u201d Gillum, however, referred to DeSantis as \u201ccongressman\u201d or \u201cMr. DeSantis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe subliminal message to people watching that debate was \u2018I\u2019m going to put you in your place, boy,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201c\u2019I\u2019m going to put you in your place, and I\u2019m not going to give you your due respect. You can call me mister, \u2019cause that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do \u2014 and I\u2019m going to call you Andrew.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was just so disrespectful, but to see it happen twice, in each debate? DeSantis did the same thing. It was very disrespectful. That was just very disconcerting \u2026 to see someone as young as DeSantis to carry that subliminal message of \u2018I\u2019m going to put you in your place.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nNone of it shook Gillum, though. In the midst of the attacks, he fell back on his faith. He maintains that God didn\u2019t bring him this far to walk off and leave him. \u201cAt no point did I ever think there wasn\u2019t a way to win,\u201d he says. \u201cAt no point. If I had, I would not have finished. There was no point in the race that I did not think we could win.\n\n\u201cThis got laid on my heart. I didn\u2019t seek it,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo all I had to do was be disciplined to it. Even now, we\u2019re running around the state like we\u2019re 10 points behind, because that\u2019s what you have to do. That hustle is required. But I have to tell you, I think the story is already written on this. I think the outcome is already determined. I\u2019m walking in it.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost The Gillums stand with other FAMU alumni during the homecoming football game coin toss.\n\nBy 10:30 a.m., Gillum is nearing the end of the parade. A smudge of brown foundation sits on his shoulder, a residue of all the hugs he has given in the past two hours. He\u2019s still charged up. He\u2019s still greeting people who flock toward him. His arms are still open, and his smile remains as wide as it was at 8:15.\n\nAs he passes, a woman in the crowd shouts, \u201cHe\u2019s making history!\u201d\n\nMitchell, Harper Williams, Lamb, Chestnut and Thaell all believe that Gillum understands the magnitude of this election. When he won the nomination, he became the first black person to win a major party nomination in the state. Not to mention that seeing another black man doing something like this is affirming in a society that doesn\u2019t allow most black people the space to be anything greater than the racist popular imagination.\n\nLater I ask Gillum about the historic nature of this election. I tell him what black folks around the state have said to me about what his campaign means to them, about what it means to their children and grandchildren. His eyes widen, and a soft \u201cwow\u201d escapes his lips, and he seems to retreat inward. The natural extrovert who always has something to contribute looks stumped by what he should say next.\n\n\u201cI try to keep it in its proper place. Not to let, you know, history overtake the present,\u201d he says, perking back up a bit. \u201cBut not for a moment do I not have, in the backdrop, what this means \u2014 not just for that woman\u2019s children but for my own children and for the kids I mentored over the years \u2014 to be able to see someone that is accessible and that reflects their lives in the way that I think I do. Because there\u2019s nothing that disrupts somebody\u2019s negative opinion of themselves or what people limit them to better than seeing it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe needs no introduction!\u201d shouts an announcer at the parade. \u201cThe FAMU graduate, the mayor of the city of Tallahassee ... Andrew Gillum! Let\u2019s hear it for Gov. Andrew Gillum!\u201d\n\nGillum throws his hand up to wave at the crowd surrounding him. Cheers and applause pierce the air, drowning out the ambient noise of the marching bands, and wrap around him like a mother\u2019s warm embrace.\n\n\u201cBring it home, Andrew!\u201d chants the crowd. \u201cBring it home.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-care-new-york-washington-california_us_5c34c9d7e4b0116c11f0a5bc": "After nine years of playing defense on Obamacare, Democratic leaders at the state and local level want to go on offense when it comes to health care.\n\nNew plans announced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week also demonstrate that ideas short of single-payer could partially address the shortcomings of America\u2019s health care system \u2015 and reach people the Affordable Care Act did not.\n\nNewsom, Inslee and de Blasio all support the implementation of a national, government-run single-payer health care system, but that\u2019s not the focus of this round of policy proposals.\n\n\n\nInstead, the two governors are calling for new programs \u2015 and spending \u2015 to shore up the health insurance market for people who find Affordable Care Act exchange policies too expensive. In New York, the mayor is eyeing a local plan to use city money to cover medical expenses for uninsured residents. The California and New York City proposals include assistance for undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for federal programs like Medicaid and the health insurance exchanges.\n\nDemocrats are bullish on health care as an electoral issue after focusing on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda during the midterm elections last year, during which the party won control of the U.S. House and made gains in state legislatures and governors\u2019 offices around the country. In addition, voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2015 three reliably Republican states \u2015 approved ballot initiatives to expand coverage for low-income residents through Medicaid.\n\nNotably, Inslee and de Blasio are potential presidential candidates this cycle, something Newsom has ruled out. Newsom is in his first days as California governor after winning election in November, while Inslee and de Blasio are each in their second terms in office.\n\nSingle-payer health care proposals have become mainstream among Democratic officials at all levels of government in the wake of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 Democratic presidential campaign and electoral wins last year by proponents of the policy who now serve in Congress and state legislatures.\n\nOther Democrats have proposed an expanded government role in providing health coverage and medical care through means such as a public option plan that would compete with private health insurance or proposals to allow consumers to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nBut it\u2019s virtually certain that no major expansions are going to happen in Washington for the next two years because Republicans still control the Senate and the White House. Their agenda has focused for years on scaling back federal and state programs that provide assistance to low- and middle-income families and would lead to millions fewer Americans covered.\n\nAt least for now, it\u2019s up to the states \u2015 and cities \u2015 to act.\n\n\u201cLots of time and energy has been put into taking away health care from tens of millions of people,\u201d de Blasio said Tuesday during a press conference at a Bronx hospital. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here in New York City, we\u2019re getting health care to a lot of people who never had it before. We\u2019re going the opposite direction.\u201d\n\nCalifornia, New York and Washington are among the states that embraced the Affordable Care Act by immediately adopting its Medicaid expansion for low-income adults and by creating state-run health insurance exchanges.\n\nThese states also already have relatively generous health care safety nets. The uninsured rates in all three states are below the national average of 10 percent as of 2017, the most recent year for which Census data on the uninsured at the state level are available.\n\n\u201cWe have done fantastic things in the state, with one of \u2015 if not the \u2015 most successful health care efforts in the United States,\u201d Inslee said at Tuesday press conference, just hours after de Blasio\u2019s. \u201cBut there is more to do.\u201d\n\nJae C. Hong/Associated Press California Gov. Gavin Newsom\ufeff (D) is pushing for policies to expand health care access in his state.\n\nThe California Plan\n\nSingle-payer is still the main topic of political discussion in California, and among the moves Newsom made on Monday was to send a letter to the Trump administration and congressional leaders calling for legislation that would give states like his the authority to craft their own single-payer systems.\n\nBut given that single-payer is staunchly opposed by Republicans in Washington and has struggled to get sufficient support even in California\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature, the more consequential action, for now, will likely be on three other parts of Newsom\u2019s announcement.\n\nOne is a call to substantially increase the financial assistance available to people who buy private insurance through Covered California, which is the online insurance marketplace that the state runs as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, tax credits are available to people whose incomes are up to four times the poverty line, or $48,500 for an individual and $100,400 a year for a family of four. People with higher incomes can find coverage difficult, if not impossible, to afford \u2015 even in California, where the marketplace is considered among the most successful in the country.\n\nAnd because the tax credits are available on a sliding scale, relative to income, even some people eligible for assistance struggle with either premiums, high out-of-pocket costs or both.\n\nNewsom is calling for legislation that would make many more people eligible for assistance \u2015 increasing the thresholds all the way up to $72,840 for individuals and $150,600 for a family of four. The legislation would also provide more assistance for people who already qualify.\n\nIn order to offset the cost of those new subsidies, Newsom wants to reinstate the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance \u2015 a penalty that was part of the Affordable Care Act until congressional Republicans and Trump eliminated it, effective this year. This would make California the fourth state to adopt an individual mandate with a penalty; Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont already have such a policy in law.\n\nFinally, Newsom called for legislation that would open up Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of the Medicaid program, to undocumented young adults. California already offers Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants until they turn 19. This would push the eligibility age up to 26.\n\nA similar proposal that the state legislature considered last year would have cost an estimated $250 million per year, according to the Los Angeles Times, and it would all have to come from California because federal dollars cannot be spent on health care programs for undocumented immigrants under the Affordable Care Act and other laws.\n\nThe outlook for any of these proposals in the state legislature is unclear. California has a history of aggressive action to help people get health care, up to and including its implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But some of its more ambitious initiatives have failed because legislators could not agree on funding and the state constitution requires a two-thirds vote for new taxes.\n\nThe other initiative Newsom announced Monday will affect prescription drugs and won\u2019t require legislative action because Newsom was able to use executive authority. He issued an order that will allow one state agency to negotiate prices for all state programs that purchase drugs. That includes Medi-Cal, which by itself insures some 13 million people.\n\nWhether it succeeds in reducing drug prices meaningfully ultimately will depend on a number of factors, not least among them the ability \u2015 and willingness \u2015 of state negotiators to exclude popular but duplicative drugs from coverage because manufacturers won\u2019t agree to lower prices.\n\nTed S. Warren/Associated Press Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) called for a \"public option\" in his state.\n\nThe Washington State Plan\n\nInslee\u2019s plan is the most straightforward and most familiar, because he wants the state legislature to create something that progressives have wanted as part of the Affordable Care Act all along. He\u2019s calling for the state to create a \u201cpublic option\u201d \u2015 a stand-alone insurance plan, which a state agency would manage, available to people buying coverage on their own through the state\u2019s exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder.\n\nAt the Tuesday press conference, Inslee said the plan would be available in all parts of the state, in part to fulfill one of its chief goals: to make sure everybody has coverage available. Washington, like many states, has had trouble keeping insurers from abandoning rural areas. This year, 14 counties in the state have only one carrier.\n\nThe public option would reimburse doctors, hospitals and other providers of health care at the rate that the federal Medicare program uses, Inslee said.\n\nThat is no minor thing. Medicare pays far less than commercial insurers and hospitals say the reimbursements are not sufficient to cover their costs. It\u2019s why a public option could potentially offer lower premiums but also why, historically, proposals have generated such intense opposition from hospitals.\n\nIn his remarks, Inslee talked about the Washingtonians who were grateful for the coverage they\u2019d gotten from the Affordable Care Act over the last few years \u2015 and those who were still struggling, even with the law fully in place.\n\n\u201cWe still have thousands of people in the state of Washington who still do not have that comfort, who still live under the anxiety of a potential loss of coverage, who still are dealing not only with the problem of a disease but the problem of anxiety over their economic circumstances,\u201d Inslee said.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said his plan would be available to the 600,000 city residents who currently are uninsured.\n\nThe New York City Plan\n\nThe goal of the New York City plan is to promise access to health coverage and health care services to all of the city\u2019s 8.6 million residents, de Blasio said.\n\n\u201cFrom this moment on, in New York City, everyone is guaranteed the right to health care,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nAccording to the mayor, 600,000 New Yorkers who currently are uninsured would be eligible for existing programs he wants to expand and for a new medical care program. Based on that figure, the uninsured rate in New York City is about 7 percent, the same as New York state and lower than the national rate of 10 percent as of 2017, according to Census data.\n\nMedical services for this population will cost the city about $100 million a year once his plan is fully implemented over the next two years, de Blasio said.\n\nAbout half of those newly eligible people are undocumented immigrants, de Blasio said. The remaining uninsured generally are people who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or other city, state and federal programs, including New York State of Health, the insurance exchange. The new initiatives will target young adults in particular, he said.\n\nThe plan has two parts. The first is an expansion and enhanced enrollment outreach for MetroPlus, a city-run insurance program. The second is the creation of what de Blasio called NYC Care, which would give uninsured residents \u2015 especially undocumented immigrants \u2015 access to medical and mental health care services provided by hospitals and clinics managed by a city agency.\n\nPatients would pay for care on a sliding scale based on their income, he said. These programs would build on New York City\u2019s and New York state\u2019s health care safety net, which is more comprehensive than in most states.\n\nDe Blasio reiterated his support for single-payer health care, both at the national level and in New York state.\n\nThe majority-Democratic New York Assembly passed single-payer health care bills several times in recent years, but the state Senate \u2015 then controlled by Republicans \u2015 didn\u2019t take up the measure. Democrats now have a majority in both chambers of the legislature and are set to reconsider single-payer, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has expressed skepticism.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-gop-uses-green-party-as-vote-splitter_us_5bdce9ede4b04367a87ca86a": "The Arizona Republican Party is sending mailers to Democratic voters tying the Green Party nominee in the state\u2019s crucial Senate race to Sen.

A onetime leftist, Sinema has shifted to the center over the course of her political career and now votes with President Donald Trump more than 50 percent of the time. Liberal activists in the state have occasionally grumbled about supporting her.\n\nWhile Green dropped out of the race earlier this week to back Sinema, extensive early voting in Arizona means ballots for her have almost certainly already been cast.\n\nIn an interview with a local television station, Green said she struggled with her decision to drop out but ultimately decided to back Sinema after watching her debate McSally. \u201cSinema\u2019s stance, on a lot of things, are very similar to mine,\u201d she said.\n\nBREAKING AZ Green Party's U.S. Senate candidate Angela Green tells #12News she's dropping out & throwing support to @kyrstensinema.

The vote provides the biggest rebuke yet of a three-year U.S. policy that the Trump administration says it has no plans to end.\n\nThe historic 56-41 vote on a resolution from Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) represents the first time the Senate has voted to end a U.S. military operation not approved by Congress. It\u2019s also a major loss for the Saudis, who are already worried about mounting criticism in Washington over their government\u2019s role in the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nBut the passage of the resolution is symbolic, at least for the moment. It will not legally require President Donald Trump to withdraw American intelligence and logistical assistance for the Saudi effort because the GOP has quashed attempts to pass similar bills in the House this session and, even if passage there was possible, Trump has already threatened to veto the resolution.\n\n\u201cToday is the beginning of a new day in terms of the Congress acting on military issues,\u201d Sanders said after the vote, adding that it is important for the public to see that \u201ctheir elected representatives are about to take back their constitutional responsibility on the issues of war.\u201d\n\nBecause the resolution was considered \u201cprivileged\u201d under the 1973 War Powers Act, which limits military actions abroad without a formal congressional declaration of war, senators were able to force a vote on it after an initial attempt to bring it up failed in March. Since then, outrage over the Khashoggi killing, fresh accusations of war crimes by the Saudis and their partners in Yemen and fierce advocacy have helped the bill\u2019s advocates rack up significant new support. They won over 10 Democrats \u2015 all 49 voted for the legislation this time around \u2015 and in an earlier vote on whether the Senate should take up the proposal, dramatically secured 14 Republican votes. Only two GOP members, Lee and his ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), ultimately stood by the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) loudly condemned it, warning that it could help Iran, which is supporting the Yemeni rebel group that the Saudis are fighting.\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel helped stiffen senators\u2019 resolve to admonish the kingdom in a briefing last week in which she offered details of a classified CIA assessment that blames de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the Khashoggi assassination, undercutting Trump\u2019s claims that the crown prince might not have been involved.\n\nThe fact that a U.S.-made bomb killed dozens of children in a Yemen school bus in August also helped convince several Democrats who previously opposed ending the policy to change their minds, according to Murphy.\n\n\u201cI think this resolution was going to pass even if Khashoggi was never murdered. I think the momentum was just growing,\u201d Murphy told reporters Wednesday.\n\nSenators faced uncharted territory in forcing a vote to curtail the president\u2019s war-making powers, including the possibility of unlimited amendments that threatened to kill the effort once more. The resolution\u2019s proponents successfully sidestepped the procedural hurdles via a parliamentary procedure on the floor, however, limiting debate to only a handful of amendments.\n\nOne of those amendments, authored by Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), would codify Trump\u2019s decision to end one crucial part of the U.S. support: the aerial refueling of jets belonging to the Saudis and their partners the United Arab Emirates. It was adopted Thursday by a vote of 58-41.\n\nThe Senate on Thursday also unanimously approved a nonbinding joint resolution authored by Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) that directly blames Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi\u2019s murder and calls for a ceasefire to hostilities in Yemen. It was backed by GOP leadership and other hawks in the Senate, who opposed ending U.S. support for the Saudis.\n\nThe Pentagon admitted this week that \u201cerrors in accounting\u201d meant the Saudis and Emiratis have not been properly charged for that refueling assistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fraud,\u201d Murphy said Wednesday of the revelation. \u201cThe American taxpayers were told they weren\u2019t going to foot the bill for this, and they have been. These are hundreds of billions of dollars we\u2019re spending to refuel planes that are hitting school buses. That\u2019s an abomination.\u201d\n\nActivists supporting the bill described their win this week as a seminal moment and evidence that grassroots pressure over the crisis in Yemen and over Saudi excesses more broadly would force even greater upheavals in the traditionally chummy U.S. relationship with the autocratic kingdom.\n\nStill, additional action on Yemen, where humanitarian groups warn millions may soon slip into famine status, is unlikely on Capitol Hill this year. With many in Washington expecting the Senate vote to go as it did, the GOP-controlled House moved preemptively and used a controversial provision in a must-pass spending bill to block the House from considering any version of the Yemen bill this session, making it harder to amplify the congressional condemnation.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the move, which was supported by five House Democrats.\n\nBy a vote of 206 to 203 congress just flushed our War Powers down the toilet.

Why? Because despite all of the anger and nonsense, Twitter is where journalists and activists hang out. It is where a lot of savvy people get their news, where opinions are formed and debates are framed.\n\nSo we were wondering: Can any good come of this? Now that we\u2019re in the early days of the 2020 election, rather than simply hitting retweet on the best Chris Cillizza slams, can we actually learn something about the shape of the race from Twitter data?\n\nSo we went to work, downloading data on the followers of six front-running Democrats \u2015 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas). We also worked out who their followers follow, giving us a detailed picture of what Beto Twitter looks like compared to Warren Twitter, and so on. Obviously, not everyone who follows a given account will support the candidate \u2015 our data reveals, for example, that over 45 percent of Biden, Sanders and Warren followers also follow President Donald Trump. But the data does offer us a refracted look at the context in which their candidacy is being viewed.\n\nSo what did we discover? We can show that Warren might be the other potential candidate who Sanders\u2019 followers are most interested in hearing from \u2015 but the feeling apparently isn\u2019t mutual for Warren\u2019s followers. We can also reveal that Biden\u2019s followers have the least interest in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and make one hypothesis on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s meteoric rise.\n\nHow We Did It\n\nTo mine this data, we had to work within the limitations of Twitter\u2019s tools \u2015 this is the bit that stats nerds will find most interesting. For our initial samples, we took 100,000 followers of each from the six potential candidates. For those who have multiple Twitter accounts \u2015 for example, Bernie has both @BernieSanders and @SenSanders \u2015 we chose the account more closely linked to their campaign rather than their office, which in all cases happily turned out to be the account with more followers anyway.\n\nSo we had six sets of 100,000 followers, each made up of the followers that Twitter spat back at us when we queried its servers \u2015 which, considering how Twitter works, is most likely each account\u2019s more recent followers. We then randomly crunched the numbers on 8,000 followers from each of these large samples so we could work out who they, in turn, are following.\n\nFor byzantine technical reasons, we discounted any accounts following 5,000 or more accounts. This could arguably make the data more useful, as we\u2019re more likely to capture data on users who might actually stand a chance of consuming candidates\u2019 content, rather than users who follow many thousands of accounts for other reasons.\n\nEach potential candidate\u2019s sample size is slightly different from the rest, but we believe each sample is broadly statistically significant to a 99 percent confidence level with around a 1.5 percent margin of error, as long as you generally accept our methodology.\n\nThe other obvious caveat is that the samples are not weighted by demographics or other factors, so this is not analogous to a high-quality, scientific poll. Let\u2019s not go wild and start drawing concrete conclusions from this data.\n\nThis is a snapshot of the potential social media dynamics of the coming primary, demonstrating the interests and preferences of the followers of six major potential candidates. It tells us which other candidates and Twitter accounts could have the most influence or strongest ability to reach followers of each candidate. In other words: We know that Twitter isn\u2019t reflective of the real world, but the dynamics in the social media war will matter \u2015 so this is more of an attempt to provide some data points to help understand that.\n\nBlue On Blue\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at what proportion of each candidate\u2019s followers also follow the five other politicians we have looked at, and indulge in some wild speculation.\n\nFirst up, here\u2019s a look at the account for Warren \u2015 the only one of the six who has declared she plans to run. The results for her recently renamed @ewarren account are perhaps not what you might expect. Despite her position on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, Booker is the potential candidate in whom her followers are otherwise most interested. Booker is sometimes framed as a more corporatist or centrist Democrat, but 32 percent of Warren\u2019s followers follow him \u2015 while just 18 percent of Warren\u2019s followers follow Sanders, arguably her closest ideological rival.\n\nSo what about Sanders himself? Warren is by some distance the other candidate that his 8.96 million followers are most interested in hearing from; 52.5 percent of his followers also follow her. Of our sample, the candidate whom Bernie followers are least interested in is Biden \u2015 but to keep this apparent ideological distance in perspective, the former vice president is still followed by 30 percent of Sanders\u2019 followers.\n\nThe relative disinterest in Biden, however, does appear to be mutual. According to this data, only 20 percent of his 3.2 million followers are also following Sanders.\n\nNow here\u2019s Booker. What\u2019s perhaps most striking is how his followers are less likely to follow the other candidates (compared to, say, Sanders). Just 24 percent of his followers also follow Harris, and she\u2019s the other potential candidate his followers are most interested in. Sanders performs the worst, with just under 10 percent of Booker\u2019s followers also following the Vermont senator.\n\nThis is actually pretty surprising. If we had made a guess before running the numbers, we would have guessed the opposite: Given that Sanders has a much higher profile off the back of 2016, surely he would be the candidate with the fewest mutuals? Wouldn\u2019t many of his followers be average Americans, not nerds like us who follow lots of politicians and read detailed data analyses? But this suggests otherwise \u2015 that Booker has forged the most \u201cindependent\u201d Twitter footprint, compared to the other candidates. Why? We have no idea.\n\nHarris is in almost the opposite situation as Booker, as she has the single biggest overlap with another potential candidate. Amazingly, 60 percent of her followers also follow Booker.\n\nAnd finally, what of the Democrats\u2019 new wunderkind, O\u2019Rourke, who is a youthful, umm, 46 years old? His followers appear most interested in Booker, Harris and Warren, with Biden and Sanders proving less enticing. So maybe add this as fuel to the fire in the ongoing Beto/Bernie Twitter war...\n\nInfluential Voices?\n\nWe also looked at which Twitter accounts are the most popular among the followers of each of the six candidates, in hopes of giving a more detailed snapshot of which voices could conceivably influence the social media conversation during the primary.\n\nFor example, Oprah Winfrey is followed by 37 percent of Cory followers \u2015 which arguably makes her a slightly more influential voice on \u201cBooker Twitter\u201d than \u201cBeto Twitter.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Rachel Maddow is hugely influential in several of the potential candidates\u2019 Twitter worlds \u2015 a significant proportion of every candidates\u2019 following are also following the MSNBC host. (It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the other candidates follow in the footsteps of Warren by heading over to Maddow\u2019s studio for a long-form interview once they say they have plans to run.)\n\nIt\u2019s also striking to see how many of the potential candidates\u2019 followers follow Ocasio-Cortez, Congress\u2019 biggest new star. Despite having only been a national figure for a few months, Twitter data suggests what is obvious in the real world: Ocasio-Cortez is well-positioned to be hugely influential in the primary. Over 50 percent of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s followers also follow her (and she even already has double the number of followers that he does), as do over 40 percent of the followers for both Warren and Sanders. Only Biden\u2019s followers seem less interested in what she has to say.\n\nThis data also contains some fun surprises. For example, it turns out Sanders\u2019 followers are most likely to follow SpaceX, even though that doesn\u2019t make much intuitive ideological sense. Our guess that it isn\u2019t all \u201cChapo Trap House\u201d listeners looking for material to dump on Elon Musk. Instead, it\u2019s probably more of a reflection of Sanders\u2019 mainstream success in 2016 \u2015 so his almost 9 million followers are perhaps more reflective of average Americans, with average interests, and not just people who read Jacobin.\n\nYou may be wondering how O\u2019Rourke became such a big deal so quickly. Yes, he\u2019s an impressive candidate. But some of his rise could have something to do with the fact that almost 9 percent of his 1.2 million followers also follow \u201cPod Save America,\u201d a podcast that consistently boosted him throughout his 2018 Senate campaign.\n\nChoose Your Own Twitter Argument\n\nNow here\u2019s the exciting part: You can forget our wild speculation about the data above and have your own fun. We\u2019ve built a tool to look into our data so that you can type in the name of a Twitter account, then see how popular that given account is among the followers of these six major potential candidates. There\u2019s data for over 25,000 accounts, so knock yourselves out \u2015 and don\u2019t forget to tweet your most interesting finds back at us.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-campaign-video-populism-dna_us_5c2a6b87e4b08aaf7a92e073": "Sen.

The trouble started in October when she tried to defuse the controversy over her past claims of Native American ancestry by taking a DNA test and producing yet another video, this one featuring relatives vouching for her side of the story.\n\nThe test and testimonials actually backed up her repeated statements that, as a child, she\u2019d been told she had a Native American ancestor. They came on the heels of an exhaustive Boston Globe investigation showing that claims of Native heritage had played no role in Warren\u2019s getting law faculty positions at the University of Texas, the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard.\n\nEven so, Warren ended up angering Native American activists and provoking a new round of \u201cPocahontas\u201d mockery from President Donald Trump, creating a media scrum that raised new doubts about her political judgment rather than quelling old ones about her ancestry and honesty.\n\nEvery person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, & take care of themselves & the people they love. That\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for, & that\u2019s why I\u2019m launching an exploratory committee for president. I need you with me: https://t.co/BNl2I1m8OX pic.twitter.com/uXXtp94EvY \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) December 31, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, many of the progressives who had urged her to run in 2016 had since become more excited about Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ultimately did challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Other voters in the party seemed increasingly interested in younger, less familiar candidates, such as Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic congressman from Texas who came surprisingly close to ousting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nSince then a series of polls has shown Warren falling in the Democratic pack, despite her high name-recognition and familiarity to politically informed voters. And although early polls are notoriously misleading, one problem for Warren is the questions some progressives have about her electability. As much as they may support her positions, they worry that she will come off as too liberal or maybe too shrill \u2015 an adjective, they know only too well, that voters apply selectively to women.\n\nThese are not crazy thoughts. Warren really does have some serious political liabilities. But it\u2019s an open question just how much those liabilities would matter at the polls \u2015 and Democrats should know this better than anybody, just based on recent history.\n\nFive different Democrats have run for president since 1992, and the two that won carried massive, potentially fatal vulnerabilities into their campaigns. For Bill Clinton, the problem was accusations of philandering and serial dishonesty at a time when those characteristics were considered at least somewhat disqualifying. For Barack Obama, it was darker skin and a Middle Eastern-sounding middle name at a time when (as now) racism remained among the most powerful forces in politics.\n\nTheir eventual electoral success, despite these weaknesses, had a lot to do with the political environments in which they first sought the office. If you want to challenge a president, it helps to campaign when the economy is struggling. But what ultimately allowed Clinton and Obama to succeed were their electoral assets \u2015 including their charisma and eloquence, their superior campaign organizations, and ultimately their ability to carry a message perfectly suited for the political moment and the opponents they faced.\n\nThe same was not true of Al Gore, John Kerry or Hillary Clinton. They were experienced and smart, for sure, but they had ambiguous political identities and reputations, deserved or not, of altering their positions to match the public\u2019s ever-changing moods. They could deliver speeches competently but couldn\u2019t do so with passion. They could command respect, for the most part, but they could not generate affection.\n\nSo on which list does Warren belong? It\u2019s impossible to say right now, but there are plenty of reasons to believe that, like Obama and Bill Clinton, she\u2019s the type of candidate with enough strengths to overcome her weaknesses \u2015 especially given the man she would be running to replace.\n\nArguably two of Trump\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities are his history of personal corruption and his pursuit of the traditional Republican economic agenda, which showers benefits on corporations and the rich while taking away programs and supports for everybody else. A Democrat with a strong record of fighting corruption could exploit the corporate largesse. A candidate with a strong record of fighting for the middle class and poor could exploit the weakening of the safety net. Warren happens to be both.\n\nAs the campaign video reminds viewers, she first became a political headliner by attacking banks for taking advantage of unsuspecting poor and middle-class customers. She can legitimately claim credit for developing the idea of a new government agency to protect consumers and then lobbying for it until it became reality. She can also take some credit for pushing the entire political discussion about the finance industry in a more progressive direction.\n\nIt helps that Warren is a bona fide policy wonk who long ago worked out her own political identity and her own preferred ideas on many key issues. That might not sound like a big accomplishment, but surprisingly few politicians have done the thinking and research it takes. Even among the ranks of serious presidential contenders, it\u2019s not easy to find candidates who can articulate exactly why they want to be president, beyond the mere pursuit of power, and what they\u2019d actually do if they were to win.\n\nWarren has a few other things going for her, too. They include a compelling, impressive biography of facing and then overcoming challenges familiar to so many Americans \u2015 like growing up in a family that teetered on the edge of financial catastrophe or struggling, as a working mom, to find decent child care that she could afford.\n\nThe video emphasizes this, showing old family photos of her with her children. It\u2019s an almost-perfect juxtaposition to Trump, who became rich and reportedly avoided the Vietnam draft because of his father\u2019s wealth and connections \u2015 and who probably never changed a diaper in his life. (Trump famously has derided men \u201cwho act like the wife.\u201d)\n\nWhether all of this is enough to make Warren the Democrats\u2019 best candidate, obviously, is another question entirely. The reality is that many of the Democrats intent on running have significant strengths. They also have significant weaknesses, which Trump would exploit just as surely as he has Warren\u2019s.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-presidential-run-2020_us_5c180c24e4b0432554c31615": "Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has settled speculation about her political ambitions with her announcement that she\u2019ll run for president in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cI have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week,\u201d Gabbard told CNN\u2019s Van Jones during an interview scheduled to air at 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Hawaii Democrat said there were \u201ca lot of reasons\u201d behind her decision to run and named some of the top issues that would be on her campaign platform, including health care, criminal justice reform and climate change.\n\n\u201cThere is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace,\u201d Gabbard told Jones.\n\nGabbard\u2019s declaration follows a Dec. 12 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d in which she said she was \u201cseriously considering\u201d a presidential run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the direction of the country,\u201d Gabbard told host Chris Matthews.\n\nGabbard, 37, enters what\u2019s likely to be a crowded Democratic field. She could find herself competing against the likes of such heavy hitters as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nGabbard became the first Hindu member of Congress when she was elected to the U.S. House in 2012. She also was one of the first female combat veterans elected to Congress \u2015 deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005, and to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009 as a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard.\n\nThough considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, Gabbard has displayed an unorthodox approach to progressive leadership.\n\nThe congresswoman recently found herself publicly sparring with a fellow Hawaii Democrat, Sen. Mazie Hirono, over lawmakers\u2019 questioning of judicial nominee Brian Buescher. Gabbard accused Hirono and other Democrats of discriminating against Buescher\u2019s Catholic faith in their line of questioning. Hirono suggested Gabbard was aligning herself with conservatives.\n\nBut asked whether Gabbard\u2019s rebuke would affect their relationship, Hirono told Hawaii News Now she \u201cworks well\u201d with \u201cRepublicans\u201d and said she would \u201ccertainly\u201d welcome opportunities to work with Gabbard.\n\nGabbard\u2019s spat with Hirono is just the latest incidence of her alienation from establishment Democrats.\n\nGabbard threw her support behind Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign \u2015 an endorsement that led her to publicly resign from her role as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nGabbard positioned herself as one of President Barack Obama\u2019s fiercest critics over his handling of the so-called Islamic State. She has made no secret of her controversial views on the Middle East and Islam, and criticized Obama for refusing to use the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d to discuss jihadist groups. She opposes admitting Syrian refugees to the United States.\n\nShe drew criticism in 2017 for meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has been accused of war crimes for massacring, torturing and starving civilians.\n\nGabbard also met with Donald Trump after the election in November 2016 to discuss Syria and terrorism policy. Though Gabbard has been aligned with Trump over some aspects of Middle East policy \u2015 including whether the U.S. should provide support for Syrian militias fighting Assad \u2015 she recently called Trump \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s bitch\u201d for his failure to react to the Saudi killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nRepublican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens dismissed Gabbard\u2019s chances in a statement on Friday.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barbara-lee-loss-congressional-progressive-caucus-gains_us_5c002b15e4b0864f4f6b6cba": "The activist left suffered a major blow on Wednesday when California Rep. Barbara Lee, a progressive antiwar icon, lost her bid to lead the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nNotwithstanding Lee\u2019s loss, though, the Congressional Progressive Caucus significantly increased its representation in Democratic leadership.\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 48, who defeated Lee, 72, by 10 votes, is, like Lee, an African-American member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Lee, the most liberal person in the caucus, lost the contest for caucus chair by 10 votes should say a lot,\u201d said a progressive House aide who was unauthorized to speak on the record. \u201cAnd she lost to someone who is in the top one-third most progressive members in terms of his voting record.\u201d\n\nOn a number of criteria, Jeffries is simply more moderate than Lee. He is an outspoken proponent of charter schools, which are anathema to both teachers unions and the grassroots left. He delivered a hawkish speech at a New York City rally in solidarity with Israel during its widely-criticized invasion of Gaza in the summer of 2014. And during the 2016 presidential primary, he led the charge of Hillary Clinton allies who attacked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for being \u201cmissing in action\u201d on issues relevant to the African-American community.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) speaks after defeating Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) in the contest for House Democratic Caucus chair on Nov. 28, 2018.\n\nJeffries\u2019 more cautious brand of liberal politics is matched by a greater dependence on wealthy donors. In the last election cycle, less than 1.4 percent of the contributions Jeffries raised were in increments of less than $200, compared with over 21 percent of Barbara Lee\u2019s campaign haul.\n\nAt the local level, Jeffries is a strident ally of centrist New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and a onetime critic of progressive New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. He even reportedly considered challenging de Blasio for re-election in 2017.\n\n\u201cThis really seems like a moderate choice,\u201d said New York City-based progressive strategist who requested anonymity for professional reasons. \u201cHe has been aligned with Gov. Cuomo and not with the more progressive parts of the New York Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, New York Rep. Joe Crowley, Jeffries\u2019 predecessor as caucus chairman, who lost his primary race due in part to his perceived coziness with big donors, hailed Jeffries\u2019 election.\n\n\u201cI am incredibly proud that a fellow New Yorker and my friend will help lead the Democratic Caucus,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cNew York, and the country, are in good hands with Hakeem.\u201d\n\nIt's tremendously disappointing that @HouseDemocrats failed to elect @RepBarbaraLee their new Caucus Chair. It's a real missed opportunity to break a glass ceiling for #BlackWomen on Capitol Hill & have an unabashed progressive champion on the House leadership team. https://t.co/lZIFjs7E74 \u2014 Democracy for America (@DFAaction) November 28, 2018\n\nLater on Wednesday, in a starker ideological battle, Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, a CPC member, handily defeated California Rep. Pete Aguilar, a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, to fill the sixth-highest post of caucus vice chair.\n\nIn addition, on Thursday, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, another CPC member, defeated Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell, a New Democrat, in the race for a new leadership post reserved for junior members of Congress.\n\nProgressives likewise swept elections for seats on the newly expanded House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, which oversees messaging on key policy priorities. Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, an authority on antitrust policy, was re-elected to head the panel, while fellow CPC members Matt Cartwright (Pa.), Debbie Dingell (Mich.) and Ted Lieu (Calif.) won contests for supporting seats.\n\nThey replace a moderate member, Rep. Cheri Bustos (Ill.), who previously co-chaired the committee with Cicilline. Bustos was elected to head the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the incoming Congress.\n\nThanks to those outcomes, the CPC now has made a net pickup of at least five spots in Democratic leadership. In the last Congress, CPC member Linda Sanchez (Calif.) served as caucus vice chair and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline co-chaired the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. Cicilline was re-elected and will now serve as \u201cchair\u201d \u2015 a superior role over the three\n\nBy contrast, consider the outcome of the Democratic leadership races the last time the Democrats flipped the House in 2006. Not a single CPC member won a seat, moderate Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.) defeated outspoken Iraq War critic Jack Murtha, and the famously transactional centrist Rahm Emanuel, then an Illinois congressman, was elected caucus chair.\n\nStill, Lee\u2019s defeat is a stinging one for the left-leaning activists, organizations and women\u2019s rights groups that flocked behind her candidacy.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) could have made history as the first black woman in the congressional leadership of either major party.\n\nLee, a former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is best known for casting the lone congressional vote against the Authorization for the Use of Military Force following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Although radical at the time, her vote and famous speech accompanying it are now widely regarded as prophetic: The legislation, putatively meant to authorize the war in Afghanistan, has since become the legally dubious basis for military operations in over 20 countries.\n\nWhen Crowley, the outgoing caucus chairman, lost his primary election to Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June, it set off a scramble for his seat in leadership. Soon Sanchez, who had previously bested Lee for the vice chair spot, made clear she would not run to replace Crowley.\n\nLee was the first to jump in and quickly became a favored contender when she announced her bid for the post, which helps determine what types of legislation come up for a floor vote.\n\nShe quickly picked up the backing of the new grassroots powerhouse Indivisible and liberal stalwarts like Democracy for America; civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis (Ga.); Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairs Rep. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.); activist Ady Barkan; and the women\u2019s rights organizations NARAL Pro-Choice America and Feminist Majority.\n\nFor a progressive movement that still faces criticism for the relative racial homogeneity of its most committed partisans, Lee also added welcome diversity. She would have made history as the first black woman in the congressional leadership of either major party.\n\n\u201cLee is not just a progressive. She\u2019s one of us,\u201d said Murshed Zaheed, a former congressional aide who now leads the progressive consulting firm Strategy and Hustle.\n\nLee\u2019s loss has echoes of other progressive proxy battles since the 2016 presidential election in which the nascent left wing succeeded in shifting the terms of the debate, but not in installing its champions in sought-after positions of power.\n\nFor example, progressive Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison fell short in his Feb. 2017 bid for chair of the Democratic National Committee, but earned the title of deputy chairman and likely generated political momentum for the presidential nominating reforms that the central party body adopted in August.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, defeated a more moderate colleague in a race for vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nOf course, there are also still arguments for downplaying the significance of Jeffries\u2019 win for the left.\n\nJeffries is not a centrist in the mold of Hoyer, the once and future House majority leader. He is a co-sponsor of the Medicare for all legislation in the House and a passionate proponent of criminal justice reform.\n\nAnd Jeffries, who worked as a corporate lawyer prior to his election to Congress in 2012, began his career in public life as an insurgent, unseating veteran state Assemblyman Roger Green in 2000 with a primary challenge from the left.\n\nEvan Stavisky, a veteran New York Democratic strategist and friend of Jeffries,\u2019 noted that Jeffries is not associated with Brooklyn Democratic machine leaders like borough President Eric Adams.\n\n\u201cCalling him some voice of the establishment is probably not accurate,\u201d Stavisky said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly a progressive.\u201d\n\nThe moderates still have a lot of strength they\u2019ve built up over the years. New York City-based progressive strategist\n\nOthers, like Lee herself, chalked up Jeffries\u2019 appeal to his relative youth \u2015 and the fact that he is male.\n\nBut that does not diminish the reality that Jeffries is more of a standard-issue Democrat than Lee. Whatever the reason for Lee\u2019s defeat, it is a lost opportunity for progressive activists who proved incapable of launching one of their own into the fifth-highest House leadership post.\n\n\u201cThe moderates still have a lot of strength they\u2019ve built up over the years,\u201d the New York City-based progressive strategist said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to despair. It\u2019s still early,\u201d the strategist added. \u201cIt\u2019s good for progressives to realize they need to know how the levers of power work in Washington.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-run-foreign-policy_us_5c393bb2e4b01c93e00a0009": "Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN on Friday that she definitely will seek the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, ending months of speculation.\n\nHer bid makes sense on its face: Democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like Gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (She is a military veteran and was the first Hindu member of Congress.) Much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. In 2016, she surrendered a plum Democratic National Committee post so she could endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and argue top Democrats were unfairly helping former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton secure the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nProgressives are already welcoming the news: \u201cLet them make their case and we\u2019ll find out who has the most compelling narrative,\u201d commentator Cenk Uygur said of Gabbard\u2019s taking on left favorites Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose 2020 plans are already in motion.\n\nBut the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party\u2019s rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond America\u2019s shores. Like Sanders and Warren, Gabbard is acutely attuned to the left\u2019s frustration with endless wars. What she\u2019s offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they\u2019ve been pushing into the national conversation.\n\nOn domestic matters, Gabbard is in line with her counterparts: She supports a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, and she says Democrats need to do more to resist money from corporations and billionaires. Yet on foreign policy, she\u2019s gone rogue, tying the anti-intervention rhetoric adopted by nearly every Democrat (and Republicans like President Donald Trump) to embracing global leaders who flout international human rights standards and complain of persecution by American empire.\n\nGabbard\u2019s language is that of the old left, holding up the U.S. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests \u2015 and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways \u2015 while neglecting its own people at home. It\u2019s a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that Trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of Iraq. (Why have politicians of both parties gotten Americans trapped in these far-away places?)\n\nAnd it connects seamlessly to another Trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly Muslims. Gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from Iraq and Syria to enter the U.S., courted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite his links to anti-Muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a Fox News darling for her willingness to claim President Barack Obama was making Americans less safe by supporting Arab rebels in Syria and not using the phrase \u201cradical Islam.\u201d (Obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; Gabbard and Trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the Islamic State.)\n\nWhat Sanders and Warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters\u2019 deep skepticism of U.S. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can\u2019t be fixed and that\u2019s just not Americans\u2019 problem. They\u2019re rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with Clinton and many Republicans \u2014 the idea that U.S.-led diplomacy combined with \u201csmart\u201d limited use of force is the key to world order. They have challenged the notion that it\u2019s essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like Russia for the sake of American global standing. Instead, they\u2019re talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of U.S. citizens as well as people abroad.\n\nThe Sanders/Warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps \u2014 both in the U.S. and in rivals like Russia and China. In that view, challenging the status quo of American foreign policy doesn\u2019t mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as Gabbard did with brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad \u2015 it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-American regimes like Assad\u2019s or U.S. partners like Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism,\u201d said Heather Hurlburt of the New America think tank.\n\n\u201cGabbard\u2019s views are more a left hard-realist direction,\u201d she added, referring to a school of national security thought that suggests it\u2019s a waste of time for the U.S. and others to try to prioritize principles like inalienable human rights in global affairs.\n\nThe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism. Gabbard\u2019s views are more a left hard-realist direction. Heather Hurlburt of the New America think tank\n\nTo Hurlburt, a longtime follower of the debate over how Democrats should talk about foreign policy, it\u2019s difficult to see who Gabbard will appeal to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mass feeling across the public\u2026 that Trump has walked away from what are perceived as American values, and that\u2019s gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren\u2019t,\u201d Hurlburt said. She sees Sanders and Warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.\n\nAs the race takes shape, Gabbard\u2019s rivals \u2015 of whom there are likely to be many \u2015 will know they can make political hay of her controversial views and over episodes like her visit to Assad amid his devastating campaign against his own people.\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. Gabbard has developed deep roots in the party\u2019s left wing, working with the Sanders Institute, founded by the senator\u2019s wife, Jane Sanders, and frequently posturing as the Democrats\u2019 leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party\u2019s base dislikes, as when they endorsed Trump\u2019s strike against Assad in 2017.\n\nThe quiet hope among backers of Sanders and Warren so far is that her campaign will ultimately fizzle out before things have to get ugly.\n\nBut that\u2019s far from assured, given that many of Gabbard\u2019s supporters \u2015 particularly in parts of the peace movement \u2015 are fervent and have been hoping for this kind of announcement by her for years.\n\n\u201cThe left realists are present in a lot of places and are able to be spoilers quite effectively,\u201d Hurlburt said. Though their numbers are vanishingly small, \u201cthey\u2019re loud and articulate, and they have a critique that can be very resonant when you look at some of the disasters going on around us.\u201d\n\nHow the contest evolves will determine how serious that fight gets \u2015 and for now, it hasn\u2019t even officially begun.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for anyone to make any point out of attacking Gabbard loudly and publicly unless she starts to get some traction,\u201d Hurlburt said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jay-inslee-washington-2020_us_5c3553a5e4b0f5aba7d93813": "Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D) signed a pledge Tuesday promising to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry ahead of a likely run for the White House that he\u2019s vowed to uniquely center on climate change.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Inslee, 67, said he added his name to the list of more than 1,300 politicians across the United States who took the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge.\n\nThe vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to \u201cadopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies \u2014 companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation,\u201d Inslee said by phone Tuesday night. \u201cThis challenge calls for the scale of national effort similar to when we went to the moon, similar to when we beat fascism.\u201d\n\nInslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge \u2015 called Oil Money Out \u2015 but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has to put a candidate forward who will make it the primary commitment to get this stuff done,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be put in just one of the baskets of many issues.\u201d\n\nBy signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely. Record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the U.S. over the past three years as President Donald Trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation.\n\nEven amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images An American flag flies on top of a Unit Drilling Co. rig in the Bakken Formation outside Watford City, North Dakota.\n\nIn October, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. Yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released Tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the United States alone.\n\nA new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. It\u2019s a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\n\nYet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voiced tepid support for the concept of a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThe pledge, even more than the Green New Deal, represents a true litmus test for serious climate action in 2020 and beyond,\u201d R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email of Inslee\u2019s announcement. \u201cOur democracy is being drowned in a dark oily tidal wave of dirty money and it needs leaders who can rise above.\u201d\n\nInslee stands alone as the first candidate to say climate change takes priority over other hot-button issues like health care, immigration and inequality.\n\n\u201cThe political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be done just because somebody now decides they\u2019re interested in climate change. It takes someone who\u2019s frankly cared about it for years and years.\u201d\n\nInslee boasts a lengthy record on climate.\n\nIn 2006, Inslee, then one of Washington\u2019s 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apollo\u2019s Fire: Igniting America\u2019s Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey.\n\nThis is the 11th hour. But it should be our hour to shine. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D)\n\nSince he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020. In 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. A glowing profile published last week in The Atlantic credited Inslee with pursuing \u201carguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it.\u201d\n\nIn just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation\u2019s largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River.\n\n\u201cThis is the 11th hour,\u201d Inslee said of the time that\u2019s left to halt catastrophic global warming. \u201cBut it should be our hour to shine.\u201d\n\nInslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Inslee\u2019s third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.\n\nBut Inslee said he\u2019s not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. Carbon taxes are gaining favor among Republicans and oil companies. But a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in France and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that don\u2019t directly benefit low- and middle-income workers.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A photo shows the smoky haze that obscured the Space Needle and downtown Seattle in August 2018.\n\n\u201cPeople have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary\u201d to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said. \u201cWe may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren\u2019t worried about the deficit when they did that.\u201d\n\nInslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff \u2015 Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour \u2015 railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting \u201ctooth & nail\u201d against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August.\n\nMargolin called Inslee \u201can old corperate [sic] establishment white man who screws over the youth and indigenous folks of his state.\u201d She pointed to the ongoing fight over a massive liquefied natural gas terminal in Tacoma, Washington, which the Puyallup Tribe and leaders from 14 other Northwest tribes pleaded with Inslee to reject.\n\nAsked about the accusations on Tuesday, Inslee said the Tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was \u201cgoing to follow the law\u201d and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project.\n\n\u201cI cannot make statements about eventual permitting until that plays out,\u201d he said. In a follow-up email, Inslee\u2019s spokesman reiterated that the project \u201cdoesn\u2019t have final permitting yet.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Inslee visited the scorched remains of Paradise, California, a town decimated by the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire in history. He said that visit made clear to him that the 2020 election needed to be singularly focused on the crisis at hand.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-manchin-senate-energy-committee_us_5c097b83e4b0b6cdaf5d2fe5": "Patrick Smith via Getty Images Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a supporter of the coal industry, appears set to move into a top position on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and some progressives are not pleased.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 High profile progressives and climate advocates are urging Senate Democrats not to give coal-friendly Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) a top post on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which deals with much of the nation\u2019s energy policy and use of federal lands.\n\nBut the prospect of Manchin, who famously used a rifle to shoot a greenhouse gas emission cap-and-trade bill in a 2010 campaign ad, as the committee\u2019s senior Democrat next year did not appear to alarm some of the party\u2019s most influential voices in the Senate on climate change.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll find a way to work through that,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said Thursday when asked about opposition to Manchin serving as the panel\u2019s ranking member. While Whitehouse did not express an opinion on Manchin\u2019s elevation on the committee, Whitehouse said he would \u201cdo what I can to make him effective at improving our environment in that realm.\u201d\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), meanwhile, said he had confidence in Democrats\u2019 ability as a whole to fight for progressive climate policies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have concerns about it [because] it\u2019s all in the end about the caucus. It\u2019s not necessarily about who\u2019s chairman and who\u2019s ranking [member],\u201d Brown said.\n\nAs it stands, Manchin could become the senior Democrat on the committee because of his seniority if current ranking member Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) moves to the Senate Commerce Committee, as expected. While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) outranks Manchin on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Vermont senator suggested to Politico last month that he would prefer to remain the senior minority member on the Senate Budget Committee. (He caucuses with the Democrats.) He declined to answer a question about committee machinations on Thursday.\n\nDespite Manchin\u2019s votes opposing the repeal of Obamacare and the Republican tax cut bill, progressives remain frustrated with his spotty record on the environment.\n\nThat Manchin could be given the top spot on the energy committee drew alarm from two Western Democrats who have been talked about as likely 2020 presidential contenders this week: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and California billionaire and environmental activist Tom Steyer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for progressives to band together and take a real, meaningful stand for combating climate change. Appointing Senator Joe Manchin to lead Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee would be the opposite of that,\u201d Inslee wrote in an email to supporters on Tuesday. \u201cHere are the facts: Joe Manchin literally shot climate legislation in one of his campaign ads. He supports Donald Trump\u2019s dirty energy agenda. And he simply can\u2019t be trusted to make the bold, progressive decisions we need.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Steyer told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that Senate Democrats need to offer a \u201cbold, positive path forward\u201d on combating climate change and that Manchin \u201cdoes not offer that vision and should not\u201d get the energy committee post.\n\nAmid the outcry, Manchin this week reversed course and voted against Bernard McNamee, a fossil fuel lawyer nominated by Trump to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The senator said he changed his mind after viewing footage in which McNamee denied the impact that humans are having on the planet\u2019s climate.\n\nManchin\u2019s centrism in the Senate and support for the coal industry, a major sector in his state, probably helped him win re-election to a second term this year in a state where President Donald Trump is overwhelmingly popular. Despite Manchin\u2019s votes opposing the repeal of Obamacare and the Republican tax cut bill, progressives remain frustrated with his spotty record on the environment. The League of Conservation Voters, a top climate advocacy group, gives him only a 45 percent on its policy scorecard, for example.\n\nAsked about the opposition to his elevation Thursday on Capitol Hill, Manchin invited his critics to his office to discuss his views on the matter.\n\n\u201cCome in and talk to me. Door\u2019s open,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nWhile he did not explicitly state he was seeking the position, Manchin suggested that he would accept it if no other members who outrank him want it.\n\n\u201cI want to do whatever I can to help my country and my state. The rules are the rules. Sure, I\u2019ll do whatever I can,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause Republicans gained seats in the November midterms, the size and ratios of Senate committees could change substantially next year. Manchin\u2019s status, as well as that of other members like Judiciary Committee member Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is in danger of losing the high-profile slot, will likely be negotiated by Senate leaders by the end of the year. The office of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) office declined to comment for this story.\n\nSome climate advocates said Manchin\u2019s ascent on the committee posed little risk of upending efforts to pass legislation on climate change or renewable energy while Democrats remain in the minority.\n\n\u201cIt would be problematic for Manchin to be the chair in 2020,\u201d said Brad Johnson, a co-founder of the super PAC Climate Hawks Vote. \u201cBut even if he becomes ranking member now, that doesn\u2019t mean that the Democrats take the Senate or that he becomes chair.\u201d\n\nUnder Schumer\u2019s leadership, \u201cDemocrats haven\u2019t been putting up significant roadblocks against Trump nominees,\u201d Johnson said, and pointed to the fact that just two Democrats so far \u2015 Sens.

There\u2019s the lack of focus (Trump starts with health care and ends with immigration) and the nasty, hyperbolic attack on Democrats (he calls them \u201cradical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela\u201d).\n\nAnd then there are the predictable boasts about what Trump has accomplished in office \u2015 which, just as predictably, aren\u2019t accurate.\n\nFirst Trump claims he kept his promise to protect people with pre-existing conditions. In reality, he lobbied hard to pass legislation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. That legislation would have gutted regulations prohibiting insurers from charging more, withholding benefits or denying coverage to people with serious medical conditions.\n\nThe bill didn\u2019t become law, but Trump has used his executive authority to undermine pre-existing protections in other ways \u2015 by reversing regulations that kept cheap, skimpy plans off the insurance market, for example, and by asking the federal courts to deem the existing regulations unconstitutional.\n\nTrump also takes credit for the fact that premiums for people buying coverage on their own are going to fall this year. But that\u2019s because insurers increased premiums too much last year \u2015 in no small part because Trump was trying (and is still trying) to sabotage the system and they were trying to anticipate the consequences.\n\nBut the main thrust of the article is an attack on Medicare-for-all \u2015 in particular, the proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to create a government-run insurance program that would cover everybody.\n\nThe idea of creating a single-payer system has been around for decades, but it has gotten new attention in the last few years. That\u2019s partly because people have become frustrated that so many Americans are still struggling to pay their medical bills, even with the Affordable Care Act in place. And it\u2019s partly because Sanders made Medicare-for-all a centerpiece of his bid for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential nomination.\n\nWhether the Sanders proposal qualifies as \u201cradical\u201d depends on your perspective. It would eliminate all private insurance, as Trump says, while eliminating nearly all out-of-pocket expenses and having the government set prices for everything from doctor visits to prescription drugs.\n\nBut similar systems exist in other countries, including Sweden and Taiwan \u2015 where, notably, the government studied different models for universal coverage and decided such a \u201csingle-payer\u201d scheme was not just the most equitable, but also the most efficient.\n\nPolls show the idea is popular here in the U.S., even with Republicans, although it\u2019s not clear how many people understand the concept fully.\n\nIn the op-ed, Trump warns that Medicare-for-all would mean \u201cmassive rationing of health care\u201d and \u201clong waits for appointments and procedures.\u201d And it\u2019s true that rationing in one form or another could happen in a single-payer system \u2015 or, really, any system where government sets prices \u2015 if the government sets payments too low.\n\nBut not all analysts agree, and Medicare-for-all\u2019s effect on providers and producers of medical care would ultimately depend on details Sanders hasn\u2019t fully fleshed out. At the very least, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine variations on the proposal that could avoid such painful consequences.\n\nMark Wilson via Getty Images\n\nMany countries with government price-setting manage to spend less than the U.S. And they provide care that is just as good, if not better, and a heck of a lot more convenient. They also make sure everybody has comprehensive insurance \u2015 so, unlike in the U.S., relatively few people struggle to pay for care.\n\nReplicating those results here would not be easy. Medicare-for-all, like all big policy proposals, would require some very real tradeoffs \u2015 among them, a massive increase in government spending. That would be about $32 trillion over 10 years for the Sanders plan, according to several independent estimates. Trump cites this figure in the op-ed, but he fails to mention that private spending would fall as public spending rose.\n\nExactly how many people would end up better or worse off financially is difficult to say right now. It would depend on several factors, like whether employers would increase pay once they no longer had to pay for insurance \u2015 and whether those raises offset the higher taxes the Sanders plan would require. But both effects would matter.\n\nYet another attack \u2015 that Medicare-for-all would hurt seniors, supposedly by taking money from the program \u2015 in the op-ed is in the headline. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised,\u201d the piece reads.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new argument. Republicans, including Trump, have been using it for several weeks. It\u2019s also not terribly accurate. The Sanders plan imagines strengthening Medicare by having it offer more comprehensive coverage than the program does today. And, in fact, it is the Republican Party that has repeatedly called for some combination of Medicare cuts and privatization.\n\nNone of this means reasonable people wouldn\u2019t find Medicare-for-all objectionable. That\u2019s especially true for people presently enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans or employer-sponsored policies. They might not believe promises that coverage under the Sanders plan would be better \u2015 and, given that final legislation would undoubtedly look different than the original proposal, it\u2019s easy to understand why.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why many Democrats who have endorsed \u201cMedicare for all\u201d actually prefer less ambitious schemes, in which enrollment in the new public plan would be voluntary \u2015 and in which, perhaps, the government would impose restrictions on prices more slowly. Still other Democrats seem content with more modest steps, like making the Affordable Care Act\u2019s financial assistance more generous \u2015 or having the government put more pressure on drugmakers, but without setting prices too aggressively.\n\nBut whether Democrats end up rallying behind the Sanders bill, less sweeping versions of Medicare-for-all, or an entirely different set of reforms, they should expect more arguments like the ones Trump made on Wednesday \u2015 because, after all, they are nothing new.\n\nRepublicans have pilloried pretty much every major Democratic health care plan, from Harry Truman\u2019s to Barack Obama\u2019s, as radical, dangerous socialism. The attacks weren\u2019t honest then and they aren\u2019t honest now.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-deficit-highest-six-years_us_5bc545ece4b0a8f17ee4c5d6": "President Donald Trump likes to boast that he\u2019s breaking records with the latest low unemployment figures.

That\u2019s mostly due to the massive corporate tax cut that slashed rates from 35 percent to 21 percent, choking revenue for spending, which climbed 3 percent.

But the economy was already in a strong recovery when Trump moved into the White House, and he still boosted the deficit.\n\n\u201cBy cutting taxes in 2017 when the economy was already quite strong, Congress and the administration not only missed a golden opportunity to begin to address the fiscal problem, they actually made the problem worse,\u201d William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CBS News.\n\nThe GOP had traditionally been the party that battled for a balanced federal budget.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/larry-kudlow-climate-change_us_5bc35628e4b01a01d68ba03b": "President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser on Sunday brushed off the dire warning issued this month by United Nations researchers who say the world is quickly running out of time to avoid catastrophic global warming.\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he believes the authors of the report, released a week ago by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \u201coverestimate\u201d the likelihood and potential timetable for environmental disasters.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think the UN study is way, way too difficult,\u201d Kudlow told host George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a scare tactic, but I think they overestimate.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should panic. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an imminent catastrophe coming. But I think we should look at this in a level-headed and analytic way.\u201d\n\nDirector of White House National Economic Council Larry Kudlow says he's \"not denying any climate change issues,\" but thinks the UN report on climate change is \"way, way too difficult.\"\n\n\n\n\"I won\u2019t say it\u2019s a scare tactic but I think they overestimate\" https://t.co/f63v833Kz0 pic.twitter.com/OjRC2JFvph \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 14, 2018\n\nThe IPCC report, authored by 91 researchers and editors from 40 countries that cited more than 6,000 scientific references, details the barriers that exist to keeping the planet from warming beyond the 1.5-degree Celsius target, considered the aspirational goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\nIf greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the authors wrote, Earth could face cataclysmic planetary changes by 2040, including worsening food shortages, wildfires and droughts, as well as rapidly rising sea levels.\n\nIn order to avert a warming disaster, the global economy must transform at a speed and scale that has \u201cno documented historic precedent,\u201d according to the report. But under Trump, the U.S. \u2015 the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases per capita \u2015 is shredding major policies that aim to reduce the nation\u2019s carbon footprint. In one of his early presidential acts last year, he announced the U.S. would pull out of the historic Paris climate accord.\n\nKudlow on Sunday downplayed the overwhelming scientific evidence when asked whether Trump planned to \u201cdo anything about\u201d climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not denying any climate change issues, George, I\u2019m just saying, \u2018Do we know precisely \u2015 and I mean worth modeling \u2015 things like how much of it is man-made, how much of it is solar, how much of it is oceanic, how much of it is rainforest and other issues?\u2019\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cI think we\u2019re still exploring all of that.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos did not follow up on the question, so it\u2019s unclear what Kudlow may have meant when he wondered how much climate change is \u201crainforest.\u201d\n\nDespite what Trump and his senior aides say, at least 97 percent of climate scientists agree that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver of global warming trends over the past century, according to NASA.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who followed Kudlow\u2019s appearance on \u201cThis Week,\u201d condemned the economic leader\u2019s response to the UN report.\n\n\u201cThe comments, a moment ago, that Larry Kudlow made are so irresponsible, so dangerous, that it\u2019s just hard to believe that a leading government official could make them,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nCiting one of the report\u2019s findings, he said, \u201cWe have 12 years \u2015 12 years \u2015 to substantially cut the amount of carbon in our atmosphere or this planet, our country, the rest of the world is going to suffer irreversible damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in crisis mode and you have an administration that virtually does not even recognize the reality of climate change, and their policies working with the fossil fuel industry are making a bad situation worse,\u201d Sanders said."}
