{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-bureaucratic-coup-trump_n_5c6a69c7e4b033a79943feaa": "Sen.

Experts said in July 2017 that the Pyongyang had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States,\u201d McCabe said during the interview. \u201cAnd he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIntelligence officials in the briefing responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses to which the president replied, \u2018I don\u2019t care.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-kentucky-school-border_n_5c69ef82e4b01757c36ca404": "Sen.

As President Obama said himself in 2013, he is not an emperor; his job is to execute laws that are passed, not write his own. Congress must hold him accountable,\u201d Jordan said in a statement in 2014.\n\nThe comparison between Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and his predecessor\u2019s executive action on immigration is not perfect; Trump is claiming authority via the National Emergencies Act of 1976, a legally dubious move in itself. But the case does illustrate the willingness of some Republicans to cheer on a president as he attempts to circumvent Congress \u2015 as long as it\u2019s for a priority they support.\n\nDuring a separate interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen.

I wish he wouldn\u2019t use it in this case. But again, I understand his frustration,\u201d Johnson said Sunday.\n\nWhile six previous presidents collectively declared dozens of national emergencies, Trump\u2019s declaration over a border wall would be the first to finance a project that Congress explicitly refused to pay for.\n\nTrump on Friday signed a spending bill into law that allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 a fraction of the president\u2019s $5.7 billion demand for more than 200 miles of concrete or steel barriers.

New York was largely expected and marks the latest step in a closely watched legal battle over next year\u2019s census. Critics contend that adding the citizenship question would discourage people, particularly people of color, from responding to the survey. An inaccurate census would have drastic consequences, they warn, because its results are used to allocate congressional seats and hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds.\n\nIn January, a federal judge in Manhattan blocked the Trump administration from adding the question.

And he warned in a very unjudicial statement, \u201cWhat goes around comes around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe really scary thing for us right now is there are all these cases teed up already in front of the court. It\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said one lawyer for a liberal group who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cI live in a constant state of terror, and I do not want [the court] to take any of these cases now. And if they do, it\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d\n\nLiberal groups that spoke with HuffPost said it\u2019s obviously still too early to tell how the new court will shake out. After all, Anthony Kennedy \u2015 the swing justice Kavanaugh replaced \u2015 was once considered more solidly in the court\u2019s conservative majority. But over the years, he shifted.\n\n\u201cWe think it will be incumbent upon [Kavanaugh] and the other justices to show, moving forward, that the Supreme Court is a nonpartisan institution and will be applying the law fairly and neutrally,\u201d said Ian Fein, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether the court applies the law fairly or not, and that may affect our long-term strategy.\u201d\n\nBut based on Kavanaugh\u2019s record, they\u2019re prepared for hostile territory. There\u2019s a sense that Kavanaugh was just about the worst person President Donald Trump could have picked, not just because of his conservative positions but also because of his partisan political record. And none doubt that this new court will be the most conservative they\u2019ve faced in decades.\n\nSome ways liberal groups said they\u2019re looking to shift with the new Supreme Court:\n\nMore Coordination Among Groups\n\nEnvironmental groups told HuffPost that they\u2019re starting to talk with one another about developing approaches to the Supreme Court. If one group decides on a strategy \u2015 like trying to keep an issue away from the high court \u2015 that decision won\u2019t matter if another group makes a different choice. So they figure it makes sense if they work together.\n\nA model they\u2019re looking at is the Tribal Supreme Court Project, a 2001 initiative staffed by attorneys from the Native American Rights Fund and the National Congress of American Indians. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were a series of decisions on Indian law that dealt significant losses to the tribes. This project was set up to promote greater coordination and approve strategies for dealing with the Supreme Court \u2015 and sometimes that strategy means keeping cases away from the court as much as possible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at a very high alarm level and am encouraging folks to seriously consider making some big strategy changes,\u201d said an environmental lawyer involved in the discussions, \u201cbut I think other folks are a little more hesitant and don\u2019t want to make any big lurches yet.\u201d\n\nFocusing More On State Legislatures And Courts\n\nNo one is planning to give up on the federal judiciary altogether. On some issues, there\u2019s just not a choice.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with immigration law is that it\u2019s a fundamentally federal arena,\u201d said Kamal Essaheb, the director of policy and advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nBut on others, state courts will be getting a fresh look. In 1977, William Brennan \u2015 a liberal stalwart during his three decades on the Supreme Court \u2015 wrote a law review article urging liberals to focus more on state courts to protect civil liberties at a time when the Supreme Court was turning more conservative.\n\n\u201cUnder the banner of the vague, undefined notions of equity, comity and federalism the Court has condoned both isolated and systematic violations of civil liberties,\u201d he wrote. Such decisions hardly bespeak a true concern for equity. Nor do they properly understand the nature of our federalism.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, citizens had to trust state courts, \u201cwhose manifest purpose is to expand constitutional protections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be going full bore at the state level,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, the Sierra Club\u2019s legal director, \u201cbecause our biggest problem that we face is climate change and the need to convert our economy from a fossil-fuel-dependent economy to a clean energy economy. ... It just has to be done at the state level.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new idea to turn to state courts for protection,\u201d said Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, pointing to key decisions in the marriage equality movement that laid the groundwork for Supreme Court cases like Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges. \u201cBut given that we\u2019re facing a much less receptive U.S. Supreme Court, I think you\u2019ll probably see more litigation happening in state courts.\u201d\n\nAside from the judiciary, liberal groups will be surveying the landscape at the state and local government levels after the November elections. During the Trump administration, states have been at the forefront of challenging some of the president\u2019s most conservative policies.\n\nA central issue around Kavanaugh was whether he would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case guaranteeing a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. Erica Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, said the group is \u201cdoubling down\u201d on its state policy work and looking at where it can expand services and strengthen abortion funds, which provide financial resources for women who can\u2019t afford the full cost of an abortion.\n\n\u201cWe will work to create an ironclad group of states where abortion will remain legal even under a hostile Supreme Court,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll continue to fight tooth and nail to stop legislation that seeks to further restrict access to abortion.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Legal groups will increasingly tailor their arguments to Chief Justice John Roberts with the more conservative Supreme Court.\n\nSwaying Chief Justice John Roberts\n\nEver since Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, liberals have been looking at him as someone who may occasionally break with the party\u2019s conservative wing. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s not conservative; there\u2019s just a sense that he is more of an institutionalist who doesn\u2019t want the Supreme Court to completely lose the public\u2019s trust.\n\nLawyers said that more arguments before the court will likely be tailored to influence Roberts, just as they were for Kennedy and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor before him.\n\n\u201cHe has some institutional sense, institutional preservation instincts, institutional reputation concerns, and those might be more heightened with a Justice Kavanaugh joining,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund.\n\nSeveral people pointed to Roberts\u2019 comments in the days after the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh, in which he said the job of being a justice \u201crequires independence from the political branches.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur role is very clear: We are to interpret the laws and Constitution of the United States and ensure that the political branches act within them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose were heartening comments, and we\u2019ll see what actually happens when ideologically charged cases come before the new court, but it was good to know that the chief justice and hopefully the other justices are keeping an eye on their institutional legitimacy,\u201d said Adav Noti, the senior director of trial litigation at the Campaign Legal Center, which is a nonpartisan organization that focuses on campaign finance, voting rights, redistricting and government ethics.\n\nExposing The Bad\n\nSometimes, a bad decision by the Supreme Court can be useful. And liberal groups may have to rev up their activist wings in the Kavanaugh era to use those rulings to change policy in other ways.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to have the court reveal themselves, if you will, in a bad ruling that can then be legislatively overturned or certainly can influence the electorate,\u201d said Saenz. \u201cSometimes our job is to expose the court for the full scope of their thinking.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-kavanaugh-gorsuch_us_5bf806e3e4b0771fb6b8489a": "The recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and Republicans\u2019 2016 stonewalling of Merrick Garland have upended liberals\u2019 view of the Supreme Court as a protector of key constitutional rights. Now, progressives are starting to talk about how to challenge the power of the sitting Supreme Court.\n\nThe issues under discussion range from process reforms like ending lifetime appointments and enacting recusal and ethics laws to stripping the court of jurisdiction and retaking \u201cstolen\u201d seats. Many of the ideas have been debated by legal scholars in decades past, but the rise in interest among progressive political partisans is decisively new. And even though opinions on the path forward diverge, and lawmakers have yet to jump on the bandwagon, the discussions are evidence of a new adversarial posture toward the court for progressives and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe disempowerment that progressives are feeling is one familiar to conservatives who have long viewed the court with a mix of suspicion and outright hostility.\n\n\u201cProgressives have felt that they were well taken care of in the judiciary and that we had secured a lot of important rights with this past litigation mid-century and that was going to be the way we would defend our gain,\u201d Todd Tucker, a legal scholar at the progressive Roosevelt Institute, said.\n\nThe same 20th-century rulings led by chief justice Earl Warren\u2019s court and and the early years of chief justice Warren Burger\u2019s term in office that progressives have long sought to defend \u2015 the end of segregation, the ban on compulsory school prayer and the legalization of abortion \u2015 galvanized conservative Christians into a political bloc within the Republican Party. They were joined by business conservatives looking to roll back rules and regulations established from the New Deal through the consumer safety and environmental protections of the 1970s.\n\nThe fervent opposition to these court rulings led to a better understanding among grassroots conservatives of the court as a political entity that could be changed over time. It also birthed a decadeslong campaign to remake the court as the conservative bulwark it had been for most of its history.\n\nIn the past two months, progressives have started a similar debate on how to reform the court in opinion pieces, legal white papers, roundtables and partisan activism efforts.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The contentious confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh has lit a fire under progressives upset about a broken confirmation process and a newly hard right court.\n\nReforms On The Table\n\nLegal scholars have been debating the idea of 18-year term limits for justices since at least 1986. This reform would allow each president to appoint two new justices per four-year term. Justices who are term-limited off of the Supreme Court would not leave the judiciary but would rotate out to ride the circuit courts. Some argue it is a way to lower the political temperature of confirmation hearings and is constitutionally plausible (although definitely not bulletproof). Vanderbilt University law professor Ganesh Sitaraman, however, said at a recent event hosted by the American Constitution Society that it actually raises the political stakes by making every single presidential election a referendum on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe imposition of term limits and other issues related to the personnel of the court misses the real problem at hand, Aziz Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago, argued at the \u201cReforming The Court\u201d panel. \u201cWe are having this conversation because the court is powerful,\u201d Huq said at the New America Foundation, which was hosting the event. For that reason, he said, progressives, \u201cneed to limit the power of the court.\u201d\n\nHuq\u2019s answer is for Congress to strip the court of jurisdiction over specific issues by limiting what cases the court can hear through the Exceptions Clause. That may sound crazy \u2015 and some scholars think it is \u2015 but it\u2019s in no way unheard of in American politics. Congress has routinely increased the breadth of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction, so why can\u2019t it limit it?\n\nLimiting the Supreme Court\u2019s ability to hear cases was long a cause of populists and progressives in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The court\u2019s pro-business rulings from the Gilded Age through the Lochner-era Court in the early 20th century prompted protest from progressive lawmakers. After the court struck down a law to ban child labor \u2015 one of many such laws regulating corporate behavior struck down at the time \u2015 progressives introduced legislation to allow Congress to override Supreme Court decisions, require a supermajority vote on the court to nullify enacted laws and strip the court of jurisdiction over laws banning child labor.\n\nConservatives took up the mantle of attacking the court\u2019s power in the 1970s and 1980s by introducing bills to strip the court of the ability to hear appellate cases related to school prayer, school busing, abortion, the male-only military draft, police arrests and cases arising from state court decisions.\n\nNone of these bills ever passed. Instead, during the stretch of time from the Gilded Age all the way to the late-1980s Congress has increased the power of the Supreme Court by expanding its jurisdiction and discretion to hear cases.\n\nAdding new justices to the Supreme Court is another idea increasingly popular among those progressives angered over the Kavanaugh and Garland decisions. The Constitution does not set the number of justices in stone and the number of justices has fluctuated over the years, bumping up to 10 during the Civil War. It has been set at nine since 1869.\n\nNICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images US Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland looks at President Barack Obama after he announced his nomination in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 16, 2016.\n\nThe issue is obviously controversial as it would allow one political party to change the personnel of the court to get the partisan outcome they desire. If one party does it, then what\u2019s to stop the other party from doing the same the next time they have a chance, Sitaraman argues.\n\nBut at least one progressive push to pack the court has already begun. 1.20.21 is a public education campaign run by political scientist Aaron Belkin and backed by noted liberal Harvard Law School professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet to get progressives behind the idea of packing the court in 2021 if they have won the necessary political power to do so.\n\nBelkin, who helped organize the opposition to the Pentagon\u2019s Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell policy, wants to reverse the \u201cjudicial theft\u201d of the seat Garland was denied by having the next Democratic president appoint two new justices. The Kavanaugh seat should also be offset by two newly appointed justices in response to disastrous nomination process and failure to fully investigate the allegations of sexual assault against the judge, he says. That would bring the Supreme Court up to a total of 13 justices.\n\n\u201cThe point of the project is to unsteal the courts,\u201d Belkin said.\n\nThis argument is pretty simple and straightforward and ignores many problems that legal scholars tend to fuss over. Will it raise the political stakes? Will it bring stability to our democratic institutions? Who cares, Belkin says.\n\n\u201cTo say that Democrats shouldn\u2019t unsteal the courts because we\u2019re worried about the normative context, I think, is to ignore the very normative context that we\u2019re already in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe norms are already gone. What matters to Belkin, and one imagines a lot of Democrats, is justice.\n\nThe plan for this campaign is, in many ways, like the ongoing conservative effort to establish and maintain control of the Supreme Court. It\u2019s a public education campaign to inform progressives about the past and present conservative history of the court and keep the memory of the stolen Garland seat fresh. Grassroots progressives would then pressure their elected officials to back a plan to pack the court.\n\nDo Lawmakers Care?\n\nThese ideas and the debate around them may be percolating among progressives think tanks and online activists, but they haven\u2019t broken through yet with the most important crowd: elected lawmakers. So far, Democrats in Congress have shown little enthusiasm for these ideas, or for really any ideas about changing the Supreme Court at the moment. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he wasn\u2019t interested in impeaching Kavanaugh for his alleged lying during his confirmation hearings. And only one sitting member has openly backed adding new justices.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) is one of the few elected lawmakers openly calling for an expansion of the Supreme Court.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) says he supports adding justices to court not as justice for a stolen seat, but as part of a broader effort to stabilize the court and enable it to hear more cases. Khanna supports the addition of new justices requiring a supermajority vote of either 60 or 67 senators and the end of lifetime appointments.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you\u2019re appointed by a president and then could be influencing the nation 40 to 50 years down the line is highly counter-majoritarian,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cYou\u2019re binding future generations with little accountability to a democratic will.\u201d\n\nWhat Might Spur Action\n\nThe current Court led by chief justice John Roberts has been known for rulings rolling back progressive legislation, including the 2010 Citizens United ruling that legalized unlimited corporate spending on independent political efforts. That decision has animated progressives across the country along with the 2013 Shelby County decision overturning part of the Voting Rights Act, which similarly drew broad condemnation. But the post-Anthony Kennedy court has yet to issue a ruling, much less one that defines its perfidy to progressives. That time will come, though.\n\nCaroline Fredrickson, the ACS president, is most concerned about rulings that deal with democracy like the Shelby County and Citizens United decisions. Future rulings further limiting the Voting Rights Act, preventing states from limiting gerrymandering or gutting campaign finance laws could be easily seen as partisan attempts to help the party that appointed the five conservative justices and, thus, destroy trust in the judiciary.\n\nFor Tucker, the scholar at the Roosevelt Institute, the big worry comes from this conservative court striking down progressive legislation meant to deal with climate change.\n\n\u201cOnce you start to look at the aggressive Green New Deal policies that climate scientists say are necessary to head off these irreversible impacts over these next 10 or 20 years, that is where you\u2019re going to see the rubber hit the road,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cSome of that is going to inevitably interfere with property rights, and you have to have a court that\u2019s willing to accommodate that.\u201c\n\nAnd if the court doesn\u2019t agree, progressives will at least have started this policy discussion years earlier to help guide them towards a forward.\n\nA Switch in Time?\n\nAs progressives are discussing their path to taming the court, the debate over these proposals may be serving its own purpose, according to Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of packing the court or term limits, but I\u2019m not afraid of talking about it,\u201d Frost said.\n\nTalking about it puts political pressure on the court. That is the real lesson of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s failed attempt to pack the court in 1937, Frost argues.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s court-packing scheme is remembered as an extreme overreach of power, but the pressure it brought to bear on the court may have forced at least one justice to abandon the pro-business Lochner-era jurisprudence to uphold the minimum wage. Justice Owen Roberts\u2019 flip to the liberals on the issue of the minimum wage \u2015 \u201cthe switch in time that saved nine\u201d \u2015 is remembered as the birth of the New Deal Court which also put a nail in the coffin of Roosevelt\u2019s court-packing plan. Roberts\u2019 flip made the packing plan redundant.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-abortion-supreme-court_us_5c6054a1e4b0910c63f186b4": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Progressive advocacy groups are furious about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh voting Thursday to let an anti-abortion law take effect in Louisiana.

Collins, who says she supports abortion rights, defended her vote by saying she believed he would follow Supreme Court precedent \u2015 that is, preserve Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut Kavanaugh voted Thursday to let a Louisiana law take effect that would have left the state with just one physician allowed to perform abortions \u2015 a break from precedent, as the law is virtually identical to a Texas anti-abortion law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. He was on the losing side of the court\u2019s 5-4 decision, in which the majority said the restrictions must remain on hold while challengers appeal a lower court decision in favor of the law.

Wade except by people on the far left who are looking for anything,\u201d Collins told HuffPost on Tuesday.\n\nIn his dissent to the order, which he wrote separately from the other conservatives on the court, Kavanaugh argued the issue hinged on whether the doctors who perform abortions at the state\u2019s clinics can obtain admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they provide abortion care. Abortion providers in the state said that the Louisiana law would severely curtail access to abortions because of the requirement to the point where many clinics would be forced to close forever. Kavanaugh, however, argued that the state had sufficient time to resolve the matter of admitting privileges before the law took effect. If the doctors cannot obtain admitting privileges, he added, they can return to court.\n\n\u201cWhat he is simply saying is that if during that period of time the physicians do not get their privileges, they can come back to the court without prejudice. I think that was a logical approach, and he committed to following the precedent that was established in Whole Woman\u2019s Health,\u201d Collins added.\n\nShe has proven time and time again that she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not the millions of women who are asking her to give us the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut pro-choice advocates aren\u2019t letting Collins off the hook for her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Collins\u2019 defense of his vote \u201cabsurd.\u201d She said that requiring doctors to hold admitting privileges in local hospitals was already ruled as an undue burden by the Supreme Court in the Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision.\n\n\u201cShe has proven time and time again that she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not the millions of women who are asking her to give us the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Hogue told HuffPost on Tuesday, adding that Collins\u2019 continued support of Kavanaugh goes \u201cagainst all logic based on what we\u2019re seeing\u201d about the justice\u2019s rulings on the court.\n\nWhile Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four more liberal justices in blocking the Louisiana law from going into effect, it\u2019s probably not the final say the court will get on the matter. According to SCOTUSblog, the petitioners in the case are likely to seek further review, leading to possible oral arguments in the fall of 2019 or winter of 2020, with a decision that could come by the end of June 2020 \u2015 smack dab in the middle of the presidential campaign.\n\nCollins also faces a heated re-election fight in 2020. While her standing with Republican voters in Maine improved in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, she\u2019s likely to face a strong challenge in the general election.\n\nGOP senators who supported Kavanaugh will have to answer for their vote in coming months, Hogue said on Tuesday, adding that voters view threats to abortion as \u201cincreasingly real and material.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scotus-maryland-north-carolina-partisan-gerrymandering_us_5c2fbc82e4b0bcb4c25ba30c": "The Supreme Court announced Friday it will again consider whether lawmakers violate the U.S. Constitution when they draw electoral districts to severely benefit a specific party.\n\nThe court said it plans to hear two cases on the matter in March. One, Common Cause v. Rucho, involves North Carolina\u2019s congressional map. The other, Benisek v. Lamone, involves a single Maryland congressional district.\n\nCongressional redistricting is done once every 10 years, and the next round is set to take place in 2021. The March cases are widely seen as among the last opportunities for the Supreme Court to place limits on partisan gerrymandering before then. In 2011, Republicans, facing no constitutional limits, used technology to draw remarkably precise districts that gave them entrenched electoral power for the next decade.\n\nIn its last term, the Supreme Court heard a pair of closely watched cases involving excessive gerrymandering, including the Maryland suit. The justices punted on the issue and sent the cases back down to lower courts for further consideration.\n\nAdvocates had hoped they could sway then-Justice Anthony Kennedy to their side in last year\u2019s cases, but many are less optimistic that Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Kennedy\u2019s replacement, would vote to strike down a congressional plan because of partisan gerrymandering.\n\nIn both of last year\u2019s cases, lower courts struck down gerrymandered districts, saying they were so excessively drawn to benefit one political party that they violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cWhether it is Democrats or Republicans manipulating the election maps, gerrymanders cheat voters out of true representation,\u201d Karen Hobert Flynn, president of the government watchdog group Common Cause, said in a statement. \u201cThe Supreme Court has the opportunity to set a clear standard that will restore a meaningful vote to millions of Americans disenfranchised by gerrymanders in Maryland, North Carolina and across the country.\u201d\n\nA panel of three federal judges struck down North Carolina\u2019s entire congressional map in August, saying it was so severely drawn to benefit Republicans that it violated the First and 14th Amendments, as well as Article I of the U.S. Constitution. Republicans controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and drew congressional districts to give their party a 10-3 advantage. The GOP has reaped the benefits of that advantage in each election since, even after a 2016 revamp of the map to address racial gerrymandering. (The results of one 2018 congressional race are not yet finalized.)\n\nThe Maryland case involves a challenge to a single congressional district, which challengers accused Democrats of drawing to intentionally weaken GOP votes and swing the district from Republican to Democratic. Michael Kimberly, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the suit, argued before the Supreme Court last year that Democrats had intentionally targeted Republicans because of their political views. The justices seemed a bit skeptical of that argument, and pressed Kimberly to explain to what extent lawmakers could take political views into consideration when drawing electoral districts.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long struggled with where to place a constitutional boundary when it comes to partisan gerrymandering, or if one even exists at all. In the 2004 case Vieth v. Jubelirer, four justices wrote that partisan gerrymandering was not an issue where there were any manageable standards for courts to decide. Kennedy, writing separately, said that a standard might exist, extending an invitation for advocates to come back to the court with one.\n\nAdvocates did just that in the court\u2019s last term, offering an array of standards in a case called Gill v. Whitford involving gerrymandered state legislative districts in Wisconsin. But the court punted on the case, sending it back to a lower court to determine whether the plaintiffs in the case had standing to bring a suit. The Supreme Court said that voters have to show they have suffered a specific injury in their specific districts to bring a partisan gerrymandering suit.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hawaii-thirty-meter-telescope-permit-supreme-court_us_5bd93964e4b0da7bfc150bb3": "Following a protracted legal battle and yearslong protests that left a state deeply divided, the Hawaii Supreme Court has cleared the final legal hurdle for a $1.4 billion telescope project to resume construction atop the Big Island\u2019s Mauna Kea, a mountain considered sacred by many Native Hawaiians.\n\nIn a 4-1 ruling on Tuesday, the court upheld a 2017 decision by the state\u2019s Board of Land and Natural Resources to grant a construction permit on Mauna Kea for the Thirty-Meter Telescope, better known as TMT.\n\nThe court said it had carefully considered the arguments put forth by the project\u2019s opponents who\u2019ve described the telescope\u2019s construction as an attack on indigenous culture and a desecration of sacred land. But, per the ruling, it had ultimately determined that \u201castronomy and Native Hawaiian uses on Mauna Kea have co-existed for many years and the TMT Project will not curtail or restrict Native Hawaiian uses.\u201d\n\nThe ruling also noted the telescope\u2019s potential to \u201canswer some of the most fundamental questions regarding our universe\u201d \u2015 a benefit that won\u2019t just be enjoyed by Native Hawaiians but all of humankind.\n\nAfter years of legal wrangling and public protest, the Thirty Meter Telescope got a green light Tuesday from the state Supreme Court. https://t.co/Rh6G2SrCuL #HINews pic.twitter.com/Q52Zky4CHU \u2014 Hawaii News Now (@HawaiiNewsNow) October 30, 2018\n\nThe TMT project will be considerably larger than any of these existing structures, however. The telescope is projected to be 18 stories tall with structures spanning 1.44 acres.\n\nTMT\u2019s backers, which include Canada\u2019s National Research Council and the University of California, have said the project will open doors to unparalleled scientific opportunities. Astronomers will be able to see 13 billion light-years away with the advanced instrument and observe \u201cforming galaxies at the very edge of the observable Universe, near the beginning of time,\u201d the project\u2019s builders have said..\n\nSupporters of the telescope have said the project will also provide jobs and other opportunities for Hawaiian workers and students. But opponents of the project have stressed that these upsides are beside the point.\n\n\u201cWe are not anti-science or astronomy,\u201d Lanakila Manguil, an activist who\u2019s been protesting against the TMT project for years, told HuffPost in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s about construction, development and industrial-sized work happening in conservation lands and particularly very sacred lands to our people.\u201d\n\nMany Native Hawaiians believe Mauna Kea is the origination point of the Hawaiian islands. The mountain, which measures about 32,000 feet from seafloor to summit, is home to burial sites and is where Native Hawaiians have been known to bury their umbilical cords as a way of connecting to the sacred land.\n\nPlans for the TMT project date back to 2009 \u2015 and the project has been mired in controversy since then. Protests broke out in 2011 after an initial construction permit was granted by the state\u2019s land board. Three years later, activists blocked groundbreaking attempts at Mauna Kea\u2019s summit and in 2015, thousands of protesters rose up across the Hawaiian islands to denounce the project and more than 30 people were arrested for protesting on the mountain.\n\nLater that year, the Hawaiian Supreme Court invalidated the 2011 permit, ruling that the land board\u2019s approval process had been flawed. The project\u2019s builders were forced to apply for a new permit, which was granted by the board in 2017 and later appealed by opponents.\n\nFollowing the state\u2019s Supreme Court decision this week to uphold the permit, Hawaii\u2019s attorney general Russell Suzuki told AP that further legal action could still be possible. A request could be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision, he said.\n\nActivists, however, have expressed doubt as to whether further legal pursuit would actually be helpful. It may be time, some have suggested, to ditch the courts and \u201ctake to the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court is the last bastion in democracy,\u201d Kealoha Pisciotta, one of the leaders of the opposition movement, told AP. \u201cIf we lose the integrity of the court, then you\u2019re losing normal law and order, and the only other option is people have to rise up.\u201d\n\nThere is still strong opposition to the telescope\u2019s construction across Hawaii, but recent opinion polls have shown that the number of Hawaiians who approve of the project has increased. A March newspaper poll found that 72 percent of Native Hawaiians supported TMT\u2019s construction on Mauna Kea, compared to just 39 percent in 2016. Overall, 77 percent of Hawaii residents said they approved of the telescope.\n\nAssociated Press This illustration provided by Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) shows the proposed giant telescope on Mauna Kea.\n\nReacting to the court\u2019s decision, Henry Yang, chair of TMT\u2019s board, said the project was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the ruling and vowed to be \u201cgood stewards\u201d on Mauna Kea.\n\n\u201cWe thank all of the community members who contributed their thoughtful views during this entire process,\u201d Yang said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to being good stewards on the mountain and inclusive of the Hawaiian community. We honor the culture of the islands and its people and do our part to contribute to its future through our ongoing support of education and Hawaii Islands\u2019 young people.\u201d\n\nHawaii Gov. David Ige (D) also expressed gratitude to the court for its ruling, which he described as a \u201cmonumental task\u201d that involved the review of \u201cthousands of pages of documents and testimony over many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased the court carefully considered and weighed all the varied and passionate testimony about TMT. We believe this decision is fair and right and will continue to keep Hawai\u2018i at the forefront of astronomy,\u201d Ige said.\n\nThe project will now need to submit its construction plans to the land board for review and approval, Ige\u2019s office noted, adding that those plans will have to take cultural protocols into consideration.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mueller-foreign-mystery-company-request-set-to-be-discussed-by-supreme-court_us_5c42bef5e4b027c3bbc1e7e3": "The Supreme Court justices were expected on Friday to discuss a request from a foreign mystery company that\u2019s reportedly part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian collusion in the U.S. presidential campaign, CNN reported.\n\nThe unidentified corporation owned by a foreign government has been battling a subpoena from a District of Columbia grand jury, arguing that compliance would violate its country\u2019s laws.

California Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte said his state party is the \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d for the national GOP. \u201cDon\u2019t think California\u2019s just a bunch of crazy whackos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the leading edge of demographic change.\u201d\n\nCantil-Sakauye, the daughter of farmworkers, clashed with officials of her now-former party early last year with a harsh letter to John Kelly, who was then secretary of homeland security, and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, ordering them to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement from \u201cstalking\u201d immigrants in courthouses.\n\n\u201cEnforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey not only compromise our core value of fairness but they undermine the judiciary\u2019s ability to provide equal access to justice.\u201d\n\nCantil-Sakuaye earlier in the week in her annual address to reporters talked of a generation of judges who embrace what she classified as California values and who care about homelessness, climate change and \u201cwhat are we going to do about guns.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-wilbur-ross-census_us_5bc8bca8e4b055bc947e7317": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday blocked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from having to sit for a deposition in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.\n\nThe brief order from the court is a victory for the Trump administration, which fought hard to block Ross from having to answer questions under oath. It\u2019s a major blow to the plaintiffs in the suit, a coalition of states, cities and immigrant groups that say the way the question was added violates the U.S. Constitution and federal law.\n\nIn testimony before Congress and in a memo announcing the question, Ross said the administration added the question at the request of the Department of Justice so that the department could better enforce the Voting Rights Act. But documents disclosed in the lawsuit show Ross was interested in adding the question months before the Justice Department made its request, and that he discussed it with Steve Bannon, a top White House adviser.\n\nRoss\u2019 deposition could have provided key insights into those conversations and how the decision was made. The plaintiffs likely would have used it to make their case that the Justice Department request was a pretext and that Ross, who has control over the Census Bureau, was set on adding the citizenship question before he even instructed census officials to study the possibility of doing so.\n\nCivil rights groups strongly oppose the decision to add the citizenship question, saying immigrants will be less likely to respond to the census because they are fearful about giving information about their own immigration status or the status of a loved one to the Trump administration.\n\nThey say the question has a \u201cdiscriminatory purpose\u201d in violation of the Constitution\u2019s due process protections, and that Ross violated federal law by deciding to add the question before the Census Bureau had reviewed it.\n\nAn inaccurate census would have severe consequences. The survey helps determine how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated, and how political districts are drawn. While the Census Bureau does ask about citizenship through the American Community Survey, which only goes out to a small percentage of households each year, it has not asked about citizenship on the decennial census, which goes out to every American household, since 1950.\n\nIt is not common for federal judges to order high-ranking government officials, including Cabinet secretaries, to sit for depositions. But U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, the trial judge who is overseeing the case in New York, ordered Ross in September to sit for one. He reasoned that Ross\u2019 \u201cintent and credibility are directly at issue in these cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concededly relevant inquiry into \u2018Commerce\u2019s intent\u2019 could not possibly be conducted without the testimony of Secretary Ross himself,\u201d Furman wrote in September. \u201cCritically, that is not the case merely because Secretary Ross made the decision that Plaintiffs are challenging. ... Instead, it is the case because Secretary Ross was personally and directly involved in the decision, and the unusual process leading to it, to an unusual degree.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit upheld Furman\u2019s decision in October.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions strongly criticized Furman\u2019s ruling in a speech to the Heritage Foundation this month, saying it was an example of the federal courts overstepping their authority.\n\n\u201cThe probing discovery of the kind ordered in the Census case is just the kind of intrusion Hamilton warned against,\u201d Sessions said, according to prepared remarks. \u201cAnd we are seeing it in case after case. When a hot-button policy issue ends up in litigation, judges are starting to believe their role is to examine the entire process that led to the policy decision \u2014 to redo the entire political debate in their courtrooms.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-supreme-court-justices-pose-for-2018-class-photo-twitter-users-chime-in_us_5c016cbde4b0d04f48b3d4d4": "On Friday, the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices, including the newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, gathered for their official group photo at the Supreme Court.\n\nAs with most photo shoots, not all of the shots feature everyone looking their best.

That\u2019s a huge number at once; progressive judicial advocacy groups dubbed the committee\u2019s hearing a \u201cmonster markup.\u201d\n\nMost of these nominees were introduced in the last Congress but didn\u2019t get confirmed in time, so Republicans are expediting them in one big batch.\n\nThursday\u2019s action comes as Trump has already drastically reshaped federal courts. To date, he has seen 30 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. That\u2019s so many circuit judges \u2015 more than any other president had confirmed by this point in his first term \u2015 that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.\n\nBut Democrats and progressive groups aren\u2019t just alarmed by the number of Trump\u2019s picks sailing through. Many of these nominees have spent their careers attacking LGBTQ rights, abortion rights and voting rights, and now they\u2019re on their way to holding lifetime seats on federal courts.\n\nAs Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) pointed out in Thursday\u2019s hearing, more than 80 percent of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees so far are members of the conservative Federalist Society. For some context, she noted that less than 4 percent of all American lawyers are members of that group.\n\n\u201cMonth after month, we have seen a parade of these so-called conservative activists nominated to the federal courts,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cThey have been groomed by conservative political ideologues. They want to see Roe v. Wade overturned or narrowed into oblivion, LGBT people permanently consigned to the margins of American life, and constitutional and civil rights encroached [based] on the religious preference of a vocal few.\u201d\n\nThis story would be pages long if we spelled out the records of all of the controversial nominees who just advanced, so here\u2019s a sampling of the people drawing some of the fiercest criticism from civil and women\u2019s rights groups.

She frequently referenced the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision striking down part of DOMA that said it departed from \u201ctraditional\u201d concepts of marriage and morality.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Eric D.

In a 2016 amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court, he wrote that a Washington state law requiring pharmacists either to fill a medical prescription or find an available pharmacist who will, which had been upheld by the 9th Circuit, \u201cauthorizes an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion on the most basic right of conscience.\u201d The Supreme Court let the 9th Circuit decision stand.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Wendy Vitter\n\nWendy Vitter, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana\n\nThe 58-year-old attorney is a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn\u2019t tell senators about her extreme comments on the topic.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood says they promote women\u2019s health,\u201d Vitter said in a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new clinic in New Orleans. \u201cIt is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women\u2019s health is to let them live.\u201d\n\nAhead of her 2018 confirmation hearing, Vitter, whose husband is former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), did not disclose to the committee that she had moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference peddling false information about the dangers of abortion \u2015 or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms claiming that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News later uncovered these missing materials.\n\nC-SPAN Howard C. Nielson Jr.\n\nHoward C. Nielson Jr., nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah\n\nThe 51-year-old lawyer fought for California\u2019s short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, before it was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n\nDuring the case, Nielson argued that sexual orientation is a choice and disputed the harmful effects of discrimination on LGBTQ people. When a U.S. district court ruled in 2010 that Prop 8 violated the Constitution, Nielson argued that then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker should have recused himself from the case because he was gay and therefore, Nielson claimed, unable to be fair on the issue. He filed a motion contending that Walker \u201chad a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his [same-sex] relationship, but also his marriage intentions.\u201d That motion was denied by another judge.\n\nNielson also defended a former Justice Department colleague who wrote a controversial and now-rescinded memo authorizing the CIA\u2019s use of torture.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Patrick Wyrick\n\nPatrick Wyrick, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nThe 37-year-old Oklahoma Supreme Court justice made limiting reproductive rights a top priority when he previously served as state solicitor general. In one case, he defended a law that would have required minors to obtain a prescription before buying emergency contraception. The law would have also forced adult women to prove their age before purchasing such contraception. The legislation was permanently blocked by a state judge in 2014.\n\nWyrick filed an amicus brief in the landmark 2014 Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations are in some circumstances exempt from regulations their owners object to on religious grounds \u2014 specifically, the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his brief, Wyrick argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because \u201creligious faith is more than mere belief.

Trump has called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) a \u201cclown.\u201d Just last week, Trump claimed in interviews that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposed border security and was OK with higher crime rates.\n\nTrump\u2019s calls for bipartisanship also did not prevent him from hitting a pair of his favorite themes.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d he said, referring to ongoing and coming probes into his relationship with Russia and his business dealings. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nTrump then referenced the elephant in the room: the recently ended and possibly returning government shutdown over his demand for a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,\u201d he said, setting up for his argument that U.S. taxpayers should spend many billions of dollars for his wall. \u201cIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall \u2015 but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump spoke about bipartisanship in Tuesday night's State of the Union address. But what will he say in the coming days?\n\nTrump, as is his custom, spent much of his speech boasting of accomplishments, including taking credit for things regardless of his actual role in them.\n\nHe said the strength of the economy and low unemployment was a result of his presidency: \u201cWe have launched an unprecedented economic boom \u2015 a boom that has rarely been seen before. There\u2019s been nothing like it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the economic trend lines have been relatively constant since the end of the financial crisis in 2009. Trump similarly claimed credit for the defeat of the self-declared Islamic State terror group, even though the strategy the military has used was developed under his predecessor, Barack Obama. He further took credit for a boom in U.S. energy production, even though that trend began under President George W. Bush and continued under Obama.\n\nIn other instances, he made claims that were flat-out false or appeared to be apocryphal, adding to a running total of 4,235 such falsehoods since he took office.\n\nIn the lengthy section of the speech devoted to illegal immigration, for example, Trump repeated a claim that kidnapped women and children are being smuggled into the country by \u201cthe thousands\u201d to be sold \u201cinto prostitution and modern-day slavery.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security has responded to numerous requests to provide details to support Trump\u2019s claims on the matter.\n\nAs most presidents before him, Trump promised a number of new proposals: an initiative to eliminate the spread of AIDS, an effort to reduce drug costs and another to fight childhood cancers.\n\nWhich, if any, of Trump\u2019s proposals advance at all beyond Tuesday night\u2019s speech is an open question. Trump\u2019s White House has been notoriously poor at following through on his professed initiatives.\n\nTrump promised a $1 trillion \u201cinfrastructure\u201d plan to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges in his 2017 joint address to Congress five weeks after taking office and $1.5 trillion in last year\u2019s State of the Union. No such plan ever materialized, and not a single dollar has been appropriated. (Trump again called for an infrastructure plan Tuesday night, but this time did not propose a dollar value.)\n\nAs far as reaching out to Democrats and other political critics, Trump has done that before in prepared remarks as well, only to undo it all within days or even hours with his unscripted remarks and tweets.\n\nIn 2017, after declaring that the \u201ctime for trivial fights is behind us,\u201d Trump within a few days had attacked Obama, the Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress, the FBI investigation into his ties to Russia and, inexplicably, the host who replaced him on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d television show.\n\nLast year, after calling on \u201call of us to set aside our differences,\u201d Trump a day and a half later attacked Democrats for having failed to support the tax cut legislation from months earlier and told audiences to replace them with more Republicans in the coming midterm elections.\n\nApart from Trump\u2019s inability or unwillingness to stick to a message, Tuesday\u2019s speech will also soon be overshadowed by an actual deadline with real consequences.\n\nA temporary spending bill Trump signed on Jan. 25 expires a week from Friday, making another shutdown of a quarter of the government an imminent possibility.

An attorney, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office under President George W.

Beyond that, in her role at OIRA, a division of the Office of Management and Budget that evaluates federal government regulations, she has helped the Trump administration weaken policies on all of those fronts.\n\nHer past writings on sexual assault perhaps stand out the most in her bid for a lifetime federal court seat.\n\nIn a 1994 op-ed in The Yale Herald, titled \u201cShades of Gray,\u201d Rao argued that \u201ca woman, like a man, decides when and how much to drink. And if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.\u201d She wrote that \u201ca good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\u201d\n\nIn an April 1993 piece in the Yale Free Press, titled \u201cThe Feminist Dilemma,\u201d Rao argued that the \u201ccontroversy\u201d over sexual assault and date rape \u201chas been painted in terms of \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019, reducing sex to something merely consensual.\u201d She said \u201cnon-verbal communication plays an undeniable role,\u201d and though she is \u201cnot arguing that date rape victims ask for it, when playing the modern dating game women have to understand and accept the consequences of their sexuality.\u201d\n\nRao\u2019s record at OIRA isn\u2019t great on policies affecting sexual assault, either.\n\nSince November 2017, she\u2019s stalled proposed guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to give employers more information on how to handle sexual misconduct. And under her leadership, OIRA signed off on a proposed rule change by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that would narrow the definition of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses and strengthen the rights of the accused.\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters Neomi Rao reacts to President Donald Trump announcing that she is his choice for filling Brett Kavanaugh's former seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nDemocrats will be grilling Rao on plenty of topics in Tuesday\u2019s hearing, in part because some on the committee \u2015 Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) \u2015 recently announced presidential bids and will want the limelight. But it\u2019s also because so many of Rao\u2019s past writings on issues like race, sexuality and science are ripe for scrutiny.\n\nShe wrote in February 1995 that \u201cYale has dedicated itself to a relatively firm meritocracy, which drops its standards only for a few minorities, some legacies and a football player here or there.\u201d When she was a junior at Yale, she wrote another article titled \u201dSeparate but More Than Equal,\u201d in which she denounced \u201cspecial treatment for minority students\u201d and suggested that students of color have an unfair advantage by having \u201cethnic deans\u201d devoted to assisting them.\n\nShe wrote in November 1994 that the push for LGBTQ rights was a \u201ctrendy political movement.\u201d She warned in July 1994 that \u201cmulticulturalists are trying to \u201cundermine American culture.\u201d\n\nIn April 1992, Rao wrote that \u201cthe greenhouse effect, the depleting ozone layer, and the dangers of acid rain\u201d are \u201cthree major environmental bogeymen.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s affected policies on all of these fronts at OIRA. Under her leadership, the agency has reviewed and is in the process of working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to roll back protections against housing discrimination based on race. She approved a proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, a public protection program that reduced greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. OIRA is also finalizing a new policy proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow health care providers to refuse to provide care to patients on the grounds of \u201cconscientious objections,\u201d as in LGBTQ patients or women seeking reproductive care.\n\nIf confirmed, Rao would be the second Indian-American after Sri Srinivasan to land a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which is considered the second most powerful court in the country.\n\nBut unlike Srinivasan, Rao has drawn opposition from prominent Indian-Americans, such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Groups including the NAACP and Human Rights Campaign have also denounced Rao\u2019s nomination, which means Tuesday\u2019s hearing could be explosive if Democrats are prepared to channel that outrage.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neomi-rao-apology-date-rape-court_us_5c622229e4b071a3b765e878": "Neomi Rao, the nominee for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has apologized for her past writings that blamed sexual assault survivors for their own date rape.\n\nRao wrote a letter Monday to the Senate Judiciary Committee condemning \u201csexual assault in all forms\u201d and apologizing for her insensitivity in remarks she made from her days at Yale University in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cAs a college student, I was sheltered.

Lisa Murkowski.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 They opposed confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. They voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act. They voted against confirming Betsy DeVos to be the secretary of education.\n\nThis describes virtually every Senate Democrat (except for West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who voted for Kavanaugh) on some of the most consequential votes taken since Donald Trump became president.\n\nIt also describes one Republican: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nFor the past two years, Murkowski has bucked her party when it often mattered the most. Her vote against Obamacare repeal was arguably her boldest; she resisted intense GOP lobbying and public criticism from Trump to join two other Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and the late John McCain of Arizona, to torpedo her party\u2019s priority issue.\n\nHer vote against DeVos meant Vice President Mike Pence had to come to the Senate to break a tie. And her opposition to Kavanaugh was as significant as it was dramatic. The outcome was going to be close, and nobody knew what Murkowski planned to do \u2015 including her staff \u2015 until the Senate held a procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. When her name was called, Murkowski stood up at her desk, looked dead ahead and said in a barely audible voice, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n(She ended up voting \u201cpresent\u201d on the final vote for an arcane procedural reason; the Congressional Record reflects her position was a \u201cno\u201d on the nomination.)\n\nTrump tore into Murkowski after that vote, warning that she \u201cwill never recover\u201d politically. The Alaska GOP considered reprimanding her, as well as withdrawing its support for her and requesting that she not seek re-election in 2022 as a Republican.\n\nMonths after the furor, tucked away in a Capitol Hill office decorated with maps, Native Alaskan art and fish mounted on the walls, she says she has no regrets.\n\n\u201cAlmost without exception, I hear \u2018thanks\u2019 from people, whether they\u2019re Alaskans or strangers you\u2019re passing in an airport somewhere,\u201d she said in a Monday interview. \u201cSome thank me for not voting for (Kavanaugh). Some thank me for just voting my own conscience and not being tied to a party position.\u201d\n\nJen Bendery Sen. Lisa Murkowski shares her office with \u201cWalter,\u201d a 63-pound salmon.\n\nShe acknowledged she\u2019s \u201cnot so naive\u201d to think that everyone in her state party is pleased with her. But that\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cI still believe that it was the right vote for me, and if I had to do it all over again, it would be the same vote,\u201d she said. \u201cI have moved on, and I think most Alaskans have as well.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the Republican senator largely votes with her party. She\u2019s voted to confirm all of Trump\u2019s lifetime federal judges beyond Kavanaugh, even though she\u2019s pro-choice and many of Trump\u2019s court picks strongly oppose abortion rights. She voted for the GOP tax bill that gives the richest 1 percent of Americans 82 percent of its benefits over time.\n\nBut sitting in front of a monstrously large, wall-mounted Alaska king salmon that she caught herself \u2015 his name is \u201cWalter\u201d and he weighed 63 pounds when he was alive, rest his soul \u2015 Murkowski seemed incredibly at ease with her reputation for acting more independently than her GOP colleagues. It makes her a rare breed in a Congress that\u2019s become so politically polarized that it struggles just to keep the government open.\n\nStrategically, Murkowski\u2019s position makes sense, considering the Alaskans who actually get her elected. Despite representing a red state, her base is not conservative Republicans, but a cobbled-together mix of moderate Republicans, Democrats and independents. And she\u2019s kept them with her for the better part of 16 years (she was initially appointed to her Senate seat in December 2002).\n\n\u201cOut of 100 members in the Senate, she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s really wearing the balls right now,\u201d Carroll Knutson, a 74-year-old Republican resident of Soldotna, Alaska, told HuffPost during a reporting trip to the state in 2017, right after her vote against Obamacare repeal. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can put that in your story.\u201d\n\nJen Bendery Here's a framed photo in Murkowski's office of the senator holding \"Walter\" right after she caught him.\n\nFor all the grief she\u2019s taken when she\u2019s defied her party, it would make sense if Murkowski has at least considered leaving it and rebranding herself as an independent. It would make even more sense given the way her party treated her in 2010, when it initially appeared her re-election bid was derailed after she unexpectedly lost the GOP primary to a tea party challenger.\n\nStunned, she responded by launching a write-in campaign featuring now-famous ads that carefully spelled out her name, M-U-R-K-O-W-S-K-I. Against the odds, and with no support from the Republican Party, she won.\n\nMurkowski, 61, chuckled when asked if it sounded appealing to ditch her party. She said the reality is there are only two parties in Congress \u2015 the Senate\u2019s two independents caucus with Democrats \u2015 and she has no interest in joining Democrats.\n\n\u201cI have looked at my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and I say, as many issues as I have with some of the Republican things, you guys have a lot more problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I maintain the deliberation and the thought and the consideration for each issue that comes before me, and vote in a manner that I think is best for the people I work for, I think that\u2019s what is more important.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-had-a-bizarre-meeting-with-right-wing-activist-ginni-thomas-report_us_5c4cb264e4b06ba6d3bd97b4": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas sits with his wife Virginia Thomas in November 2007 as he is introduced at the Federalist Society in Washington.\n\nGinni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has long been involved in far-right activism but a recent White House meeting with President Donald Trump, reported by the New York Times, is raising eyebrows.\n\nTrump listened \u201cquietly\u201d while Thomas and a group of ultra-conservative activists criticized transgender people, women in the military and Republican leadership last week, according to the paper.

While news of the meeting comes just after the White House agreed to temporarily reopen the federal government, at the time the shutdown would have seemed indefinite.\n\nAt one point, Trump pulled his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is also a White House aide, into the meeting, \u201csaying she would be beloved if she were serving a liberal president, instead of getting negative news coverage.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tammy-duckworth-transgender-ban_us_5c482b40e4b083c46d63ce50": "\u201cWhen I was bleeding to death in my Black Hawk helicopter on that dusty field in Iraq, I didn\u2019t care if the American troops risking their lives to help save me were gay, straight, transgender, black, white, male or female,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cAll that mattered was they didn\u2019t leave me behind.\u201d\n\nThe senator called the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cdisheartening,\u201d and warned \u201cit will help the Trump Administration discriminate against an ever-shrinking portion of our population who are willing to serve in uniform\u201d and allow it \u201cto further disrupt to our military and weaken our national security.\u201d\n\nThe Trump policy reverses the Obama-era move to allow transgender people to serve in the military.

Since he last testified, new evidence emerged suggesting he misled members about the basis for adding the question.

The plaintiffs in that suit sought to depose Ross to find out his motivations for adding the question, but the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in to block that from happening.\n\nCritics say the question is unnecessary and adding it was a political decision intended to drive down the census response rate among minorities.

The judge\u2019s decision came after the Knight First Amendment Institute filed a lawsuit against Trump and his communications team, arguing that the president, who regularly uses Twitter to announce major policy decisions, was violating people\u2019s First Amendment rights when he blocked them on the platform.

But as his many rallies demonstrate, there\u2019s one thing he clearly loves about the job: speaking to crowds of admiring supporters.\n\nIf the president was expecting a similarly enthusiastic reception at the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was surely disappointed.\n\n\u201cIn less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country ... So true,\u201d Trump said. The characteristic boast elicited a muffled laugh from the crowd of world leaders.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that reaction but that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said, chuckling along as the crowd erupted with more laughter.\n\nHe later told reporters that his speech was totally, 100 percent intended to make the UN assembly laugh.\n\nLosing A Bet Against Elizabeth Warren Over Her Ancestry\n\nYuri Gripas/Reuters Trump apparently didn't see that one coming.\n\nTrump had long mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for claiming Native American heritage and once promised to donate $1 million to charity if she could prove it. And then Warren did.\n\nIn October, the Democrat made public the results of a DNA test that an expert said showed \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that she has a Native American ancestor. Many Native American groups found the move offensive, and Warren later clarified that she respected the distinction between DNA and tribal affiliation.\n\nBut she also took the opportunity to remind the president of his promise. She asked Trump to donate the $1 million to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, a nonprofit that seeks to protect Native American women from violence. She also pointed out that Trump still hasn\u2019t released his tax returns. \u201cWhat are YOU hiding?\u201d she tweeted at him.\n\nTrump responded both by denying his earlier donation promise and saying he\u2019d only give to charity if he could test Warren personally.\n\nHaving To Return Jim Acosta\u2019s Press Credentials\n\nOf all the media outlets the president has disparaged over the years, there is perhaps none he seems to despise as much as CNN.\n\nFor that reason, it probably gave him great pleasure when the White House revoked CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass after a press conference on Nov. 7. Acosta and Trump had a heated exchange that resulted in a White House intern grabbing the microphone out of the reporter\u2019s hands. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was later accused of sharing a doctored video of the incident to defend the administration\u2019s decision to revoke Acosta\u2019s press credentials.\n\nYou manipulated this video. The lies never end. Here\u2019s the actual video. pic.twitter.com/pdVWbDOKTI \u2014 Matt Dornic (@mdornic) November 8, 2018\n\nCNN sued the Trump administration for violating the First Amendment rights of both the network and Acosta. And much to the president\u2019s likely chagrin, the White House returned Acosta\u2019s press pass.\n\n\u2018Terrific\u2019 Taylor Swift Burning Republicans\n\nTrump was so miffed by pop star Taylor Swift breaking her political silence to endorse a Democrat that he gave reporters a percentage of just how irritated he was.\n\nTaylor Hill via Getty Images Trump apparently likes Taylor Swift's music 25 percent less now...\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say that I like Taylor\u2019s music about 25 percent less now, OK?\u201d Trump told reporters before walking into the White House in October. The comment came the day after Swift, long criticized for her silence on political issues, endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate and condemned his opponent, Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, over her stance on women\u2019s and LGBTQ issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Taylor Swift doesn\u2019t know anything about her,\u201d Trump said of Blackburn, whom he stumped for on the campaign trail.\n\nSwift\u2019s burn must have stung, given the praise Trump gave her when he was but a celebrity hotelier.\n\n\u201cGlad to hear that [Swift] will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5,\u201d Trump tweeted back in 2012. \u201cTaylor is terrific!\u201d\n\nMusicians Telling Him He Can\u2019t Play Their Songs At Rallies\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP Rihanna shut it down.\n\nTrump has a history of being spurned by musicians for using their songs at his events, and that trend continued into 2018.\n\nRihanna shut it down pretty quickly after she found out the president was playing her 2007 hit \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d at a Chattanooga rally for Blackburn, the aforementioned Senate candidate.\n\n\u201c[M]e nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies,\u201d she tweeted when she found out about the song\u2019s usage, vowing to stop Trump from continuing to play it. She later sent him a cease and desist letter.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one. Trump also received complaints from Pharrell Williams, Guns N\u2019 Roses and Neil Young this year for playing their music at his rallies.\n\nIvanka\u2019s Alleged Misuse Of A Personal Email Account\n\nMark Wilson via Getty Images No shouts of \"Lock her up!\" from Trump this time.\n\nWhen The Washington Post reported in November that Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, had allegedly used a personal account to send hundreds of emails last year related to government business, Trump could no longer bash Hillary Clinton over her private email server without looking like a total hypocrite.\n\nAccording to insiders who spoke with the Post, Ivanka Trump was \u201cthe worst offender in the White House\u201d when it came to possibly violating the Presidential Records Act, which mandates that all official White House communications and records be preserved in a permanent archive. Perhaps more concerning, the sources said, her use of a private email server could increase the risk of hackers obtaining sensitive government information.\n\nThat was especially inconvenient news for her dad, who made Clinton\u2019s misuse of a private email server the focal point of his campaign and encouraged \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants at his rallies regarding her email usage. At the rally he headlined in Tupelo, Mississippi, several days after the Post\u2019s story, he uncharacteristically avoided bringing up Clinton.\n\nFox News Accidentally Calling Him \u2018David Trump\u2019\n\nIt was probably funny to everyone but Trump when his favorite news channel bungled his name on live television. Fox News host Laura Ingraham was listing several runners-up for Time Magazine\u2019s 2018 Person of the Year during her evening broadcast in December when she looked down at her script and stumbled: \u201cIt says David Trump on my sheet, but I assume they mean Donald Trump.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-prepare-for-the-end-of-roe-v-wade-handbook-for-post-robin-marty_us_5c3fa0cae4b027c3bbbdacdf": "It\u2019s not difficult for Robin Marty to envision a future America where \u201cpregnant people may need to travel across state lines, obtain illegal abortion-inducing medications, or keep their abortions secret from partners, family and the authorities.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s no fatalist. Marty, a reporter who has been covering abortion rights for over 10 years, has instead turned her energy toward helping others prepare for the worst-case scenario: a Post-Roe U.S.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself \u2015 what are you willing to do?\u201d she tweeted after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement in the summer of 2018. Without him on the court, the future of Roe v. Wade \u2015 the 1973 ruling that made abortion legal in all 50 states \u2015 was suddenly uncertain.\n\n\u201cWe are going to need homes near clinics for people to stay at for free, we will need transportation from state to state, etc,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPrepare to think about what you can do to contribute financially, resources-wise, and so on.\u201d\n\nMarty adapted her tweets into a widely-read opinion piece for HuffPost and now she\u2019s expanded even further, turning the thread into a practical manual for the public. In Handbook for a Post-Roe America, Marty walks readers through the various futures of abortion rights in the U.S. and provides advice on how to plan ahead.\n\nIn December, HuffPost spoke to Marty about Handbook for a Post-Roe America. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHi Robin! Why did you decide to write this book, and what were you hoping to achieve?\n\nI noticed that all these people were suddenly awakened to this idea that abortion could be made illegal \u2015 a crisis that reproductive rights activists knew had been going on forever. All of these new people were thinking, I need to stockpile emergency contraception! I need to start a group to help people get across state lines and get abortions! What they didn\u2019t realize is many of these resources are already in place. They\u2019re under the radar because most people don\u2019t think about abortion until they actually need one. This book was a chance to bring those who are new to the movement into the loop and to introduce them to the groups on the ground already doing the work.\n\nThat makes sense. So, to just back up a little bit, and I know this is a giant question\u2026\n\nThose are my favorite...\n\nI was hoping you could explain, as simply as possible\u2026 or not\u2026 what is the state of abortion rights in the U.S. at this moment in time?\n\nThe word I would use is precarious. Here\u2019s a good example. Yesterday, there was an announcement that the last clinic in Nashville, Tennessee, has stopped providing abortions. So there is still legal abortion in Tennessee, but it was Nashville that was providing a lot of the care for the state. Now that the Nashville clinics are closed, we\u2019re looking at a place where people have to drive three hours in one direction to get an abortion, and they have a 48-hour waiting period in which they have to go to the doctor twice.\n\nSo they\u2019ll have to foot the costs for hotels, gas, etc.\n\nYes. Abortion is primarily, at this point, a class issue and a race issue. People who are privileged will always be able to find help when they need it.\n\nNow, in Tennessee, if they need a second trimester abortion, they will have to leave the state. But if they go down to Alabama, where you can get a second trimester abortion, they\u2019ve got a 48-hour wait. If they go up to Kentucky where you can get an abortion up to 22 weeks, there\u2019s only one clinic, and it\u2019s already taking in all of the people who live in low-access states around it, like Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. Once a clinic starts to get overwhelmed by patients, it creates a ripple effect where more people have to travel further, for later abortions, because they can\u2019t get into their clinics at home.\n\nIt creates a bottleneck.\n\nYeah. When you take out just a single clinic, you still technically have legal abortion but it is almost impossible for people to access it. That\u2019s where we are at in the U.S. right now. We have legal abortion everywhere, but if you remove one piece, everything starts to collapse.\n\nSo zooming out, Tennessee is representative of the larger situation because there are a number of states like it, with onerous restrictions and limited clinics?\n\nExactly. At this point, we have six states with only one clinic in them. We have another 10 to 12 states that only have two or three clinics and for the most part, they are all in the same cities.\n\nSouth Dakota has only one clinic for the entire state, in Sioux Falls. It has a 72-hour waiting period. So you go into a doctor\u2019s office and you have to wait for at least 72 hours, and they do not count any weekends or holidays. You still have to do that within 14 weeks because there\u2019s no second trimester abortion available. A lot of people decide it\u2019s just too hard to do, so they\u2019ll travel to Minnesota or Iowa.\n\nWe have legal abortion everywhere, but if you remove one piece, everything starts to collapse.\n\nSo now let\u2019s move to what could happen with Roe. You write in the book that it is \u201chighly unlikely that abortion is going to be made entirely illegal\u201d in the near future. What do you think will happen instead?\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that we have a Supreme Court that says states can make any sorts of laws they want restricting abortion, as long as abortion is still technically legal. The end result is that it will be almost impossible to get one.\n\nWe saw this in Mississippi, for example. They said [abortion] doctors must have admitting privileges to a hospital. But if no hospital will give that doctor admitting privileges, then there is nobody who can provide an abortion in the state. Technically, Mississippi would still have abortion, but there would be no ability to get one.\n\nSame thing with so-called heartbeat bans. These bans say abortion is allowed, but only until about two weeks after a missed period! The idea that people would know they were pregnant that early and be able to get into a clinic that quickly is extremely small.\n\nOne thing that feels so unfair about that kind of bill is that it doesn\u2019t give people any time to think about what they want to do.\n\nI will be totally open about this. My third pregnancy was unexpected. My son came right after another birth. It was not something I was able to emotionally deal with, and I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do. I spent weeks trying to decide which way I wanted to go. I cannot imagine being pregnant and knowing I only have five or six days to decide. It is not a decision that should be rushed. People have to come to it on their own.\n\nSo, in the worst case scenario, if Roe is overturned, what would happen?\n\nStates with laws on the books that say abortion is illegal if the Constitution is ever changed or if Roe is overturned will be able to enact that.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about trigger laws?\n\nYeah. We have about 18 or 20 states that have expressly said or hinted that they are intending to make abortion completely illegal if Roe is overturned. Some of them are literally set so that the minute Roe is overturned, they immediately go into effect. It would wipe out the South. Most of the Midwest would also lose any access to abortion. Basically, we would have abortion in California and in D.C. and New York, then a spot in Minnesota and a spot in Illinois, and everything else would be wiped out.\n\nWhat are some practical steps people can take now to prepare for a post-Roe America, or a country in which abortion access is even more difficult than it is today?\n\nCheck with your state legislature and find out where your state falls when it comes to abortion being legal or not if Roe is overturned. If you are in a state that has a trigger law, you should at the very least be approaching legislators and asking them to make sure that there are exceptions for sexual assault and the health of the pregnant person included in these laws.\n\nIf you are in a state without a trigger law, make sure that abortion is codified in your state constitution. Think about your own contraception options. Get to know the local abortion rights groups in your state. Raise money for abortion funds.\n\nI was just reading a recent CDC report which found that abortion is at the lowest rate since Roe v. Wade. Why is that?\n\nOne reason is that we have much better birth control than we used to. The Affordable Care Act was really helpful in making sure that people got birth control that they wanted to use. (Editor\u2019s note: President Donald Trump is now trying to roll these protections back.)\n\nWe also see teens having less sex than they did before, although that\u2019s starting to tick back up because we are returning to abstinence-only education. But less teens having sex means that there are less pregnancies.\n\nOne of the things that abortion opponents say is that obviously this means that less people are having abortions. But they don\u2019t pay attention to the fact that it also means less people are getting pregnant without intending to. If there were just simply less people having abortions, we would see a huge uptick in the birth rate, and we\u2019re not seeing that at all.\n\nAnything else you think people need to know?", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-bader-ginsburg-draws-sold-out-audience-in-new-york_us_5c15e44fe4b049efa752ebd0": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an unlikely national rock star. But \u201cThe Notorious RBG\u201d is now the subject of a second film about her this year \u2014 in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\nOn Saturday evening, the 85-year-old Brooklyn native appeared in person, expressing love for her hometown of New York to a sold-out audience at the event organized by the Museum of the City of New York with WNET-TV. NPR legal correspondent Nina Totenberg led the question-and-answer session about Ginsburg\u2019s quarter century on the Supreme Court, and about her life.\n\nTotenberg asked Ginsburg what she thought of a marital sex scene in the new biopic, \u201cOn the Basis of Sex,\u201d with Felicity Jones playing the young Ginsburg.

The idea was to force the workers to give up their right to sue collectively over wage theft or workplace discrimination.\n\nChipotle\u2019s plan seems to have worked out a little too well: The company is now facing a flood of arbitration cases from former employees determined to win the backpay they claim they are owed.\n\nFacing potentially huge liabilities, Chipotle recently asked a federal judge to block the workers from seeking arbitration with lawyers who\u2019d represented them in court \u2015 despite the fact Chipotle had forced arbitration upon its workers via agreements they had to sign when they were hired.\n\nThe judge denied that request, calling Chipotle\u2019s actions \u201cunseemly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is their worst-case scenario, apparently \u2015 and the scenario they asked for,\u201d said Kent Williams, one of the attorneys representing the former Chipotle employees.\n\nThe mess all goes back to a Supreme Court ruling that was supposed to be a gift to powerful employers like Chipotle.\n\nIn May, the court ruled 5-4 in Epic Systems v. Lewis that it is legal for employers to require workers to sign arbitration agreements as a condition of employment. By signing them, workers agree they won\u2019t sue the employer in class- or collective-action lawsuits. Instead, the workers will have to take any claims individually to arbitration, where they have no collective power.\n\nThe ruling was one of the most contentious of the court\u2019s term, with all four liberal justices dissenting, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who called the decision \u201cegregiously wrong.\u201d Employer lobbies cheered the ruling, while employee advocates said it would strip legal recourse from some of the most vulnerable workers.\n\nOne reason employers prefer arbitration over court is that workers are less likely to bring a claim at all. A single person trying to recoup back wages worth a few hundred dollars is going to have a hard time finding an attorney willing to take an arbitration case with so little at stake. Big lawsuits, by contrast, allow hundreds or even thousands of workers to band together against the company in pursuit of large claims.\n\nThis is their worst-case scenario, apparently \u2015 and the scenario they asked for. Kent Williams, attorney\n\nWith the Epic Systems v. Lewis ruling, the Supreme Court immediately legitimized the arbitration clause Chipotle had started slipping into its employee welcome packet in 2014. The company\u2019s chief compliance officer, David Gottlieb, explained in court how these supposedly voluntary agreements work:\n\n\u201c[I]f you choose not to agree to the arbitration agreement, for example, once you have been given notice and an opportunity to look at it, read it, ask any questions, download it, save it, whatever you want to do \u2015 if you don\u2019t, then you don\u2019t have to be an employee,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nWhen the Epic ruling came down, Chipotle was dealing with a collective action lawsuit involving roughly 10,000 current and former workers who said Chipotle systematically stiffed them on pay, violating minimum wage and overtime regulations. But nearly 3,000 of those workers had signed arbitration agreements.\n\nAs HuffPost reported in August, the judge in the case, John Kane, ruled that the Epic decision compelled him to expel those plaintiffs from the suit. That was precisely the outcome Chipotle had been hoping for.\n\nBut instead of taking their claims and going home, more than 150 of those workers filed requests for arbitration.\n\nUnlike a collective- or class-action lawsuit, all of those claims would be administered separately, and they could get very expensive for Chipotle. A single case can run tens of thousands of dollars in lawyers fees and payments to the arbitrator service \u2015 in this case, JAMS. The cost of litigating can dwarf the actual damages.\n\n\u201cIf you start running the numbers on this thing, arbitration costs could top $30,000 or $50,000 [each],\u201d said Williams. If hundreds or thousands of workers pursue cases, \u201cYou get up to, like, tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars very quickly, just in arbitration expenses.\u201d\n\nUnder the arbitration rules, Williams said, the cases would be heard in the county where Chipotle last employed the worker in question, meaning the claims would be spread out all over the country. Chipotle has roughly 2,400 locations, according to its latest SEC filings. If so many cases were to move forward, they would present a logistical nightmare for the company.\n\nWilliams said Chipotle has so far refused to pay its share of the arbitration filing fee, which amounts to $1,100 per case, preventing those cases from proceeding. A similar situation has been unfolding for Uber drivers who also signed arbitration agreements. As Gizmodo reported earlier this month, some 12,000 drivers are pursuing arbitration with the ride-sharing giant. Like Chipotle, Uber has not paid the filing fees required in those cases.\n\nA JAMS spokesperson declined to comment. Chipotle, which has said in the past that it does not comment on litigation, didn\u2019t respond to emails about the matter.\n\nBut Chipotle\u2019s court filings say plenty. The company wasn\u2019t satisfied with getting nearly 3,000 mostly low-wage workers booted from a large lawsuit. It asked Kane, the judge, to forbid those workers from pursuing arbitration with Williams and his team as their attorneys. Their rationale: Because the workers had signed arbitration agreements, they never should have received notice about the collective-action lawsuit and become clients of Williams and his colleagues.\n\nKane rejected that argument, essentially saying that whatever happens in arbitration isn\u2019t his court\u2019s business. But once the arbitration filings started coming in, Chipotle appealed. \u201cThe arbitrations are going forward,\u201d the company bemoaned in its filing, \u201ccausing immediate harm to Chipotle.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled against Chipotle yet again, and leveled a withering critique of the company\u2019s legal strategy: \u201cChipotle\u2019s attempts to delay and obfuscate the claims of the Arbitration Plaintiffs in both the courts and in arbitration (the forum to which it required these employees to submit) are unseemly.\u201d\n\nIf so many arbitration cases were to move forward, they would present a logistical nightmare for Chipotle.\n\nThe pile of arbitration claims coming at Chipotle is pretty unique. It normally wouldn\u2019t be worthwhile for a lawyer to pursue so many individual cases with modest claims, but Williams\u2019 team and the workers had already built their case through the collective-action lawsuit. Ordinarily, Williams acknowledges, these workers probably wouldn\u2019t have found lawyers to pursue arbitration for the $1,000 they believe they are owed.\n\nIn other words, mandatory arbitration will probably work out well for Chipotle in the long run, even if the company faces a potential legal debacle right now.\n\nCompanies like Chipotle like to say they prefer arbitration to the courts because it\u2019s more efficient and better for both parties. But Chipotle\u2019s resistance to arbitrating these claims \u2015 after steering workers into arbitration \u2015 suggests its policy was never really about fairness and efficiency, as Kane noted in a recent order.\n\n\u201cCongesting the federal courts with countless appeals to prolong arbitration proceedings for numerous employees provides no benefit to the public and flouts the efficient resolution Chipotle professes to seek,\u201d the judge scolded.\n\nAlthough Chipotle hasn\u2019t paid filing fees yet, Williams said he plans to continue bringing more arbitration cases for any worker who wants to pursue arbitration after being kicked out of the lawsuit. After the new year, he hopes to file them in batches of 100 every couple of weeks, for as long as they come in.\n\n\u201cEverybody that we file for has individually retained us. We\u2019ve talked to them and interviewed them,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThese are all solid claims, and they\u2019re not going away.\u201d\n\nHave a tip about your employer?

Protesters have blocked women of \u201cmenstruating age\u201d from entering Sabarimala since September, when the Supreme Court ruled that all women had a right to enter the sacred space. This week, though, two women managed to slip into the temple in the middle of the night, setting off celebrations and protests.\n\n\u201cThe whole country, and especially the state of Kerala, where Sabarimala is located, was taken aback by the news,\u201d HuffPost India\u2019s Sharanya Hrishikesh said. \u201cThe temple\u2019s priest conducted a \u2018purification ritual\u2019 after the women\u2019s entry on Wednesday, there was a violent strike called by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday, and on Friday, even as protests are going on, news broke of a third woman entering the temple to offer prayers \u2014 a Sri Lankan national.\u201d\n\nHuffPost India reported on the role a Facebook page played in connecting the law professor and grocery store manager currently riling up the country.

Of the five women who originally advocated for equal access, just one still stands by her original views.\n\n\u201cThere is still a long way to go \u2014 the issue has exposed deep divides within Kerala, and there are many women who have internalized biases and claim they are ready to wait until they reach menopause to visit the temple,\u201d Sharanya said. \u201cThe taboo around menstruation and temple visits will require a lot of work to be undone.

The office\u2019s Forced Marriage Unit, which assists with rescues of British nationals duped or coerced into marriages abroad, has been withholding the passports of survivors who can\u2019t pay for their own rescue, the report said. A survivor of forced marriage responded to the news in a blog post for HuffPost U.K. that sheds light on the way some families manipulate their daughters into marrying strange men thousands of miles from home. It\u2019s a fascinating read that does credit the Foreign Office for investigating nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases last year. But it also makes clear how the policy uncovered by the Times puts vulnerable women in an even more vulnerable position. \u201cThese are not victims who had a choice, they didn\u2019t go to their local travel agent and book two weeks in the sun, overspending their resources on a jolly and expecting the good old British taxpayer to foot the bill,\u201d Jasvinder Sanghera writes. \u201cThey are victims of crime at the hands of the very people who should have loved and protected them.\u201d\n\nReuters", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kavanaugh-ethics-complaints-dismissed_us_5c198855e4b0432554c54855": "A panel of federal judges announced Tuesday that it is dismissing all of the 83 ethics complaints brought against Justice Brett Kavanaugh regarding his behavior during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings.\n\nTheir dismissal did not question the validity of the complaints but concluded that lower-court judges do not have the authority to investigate or punish Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe complaints about Kavanaugh generally alleged that he lied during his nomination proceedings, made \u201cinappropriate partisan statements that demonstrate bias and a lack of judicial temperament\u201d and was disrespectful to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his September hearing, the panel\u2019s decision noted.\n\nBut because the panel concluded that it lacked the jurisdiction to act on the complaints\u2019 merits, it chose to dismiss all of them. The judges cited the 1980 Judicial Conduct and Disability Act in that decision, which exempts Supreme Court justices from the judiciary\u2019s disciplinary laws.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservatives-obamacare-ruling-unconstitutional_us_5c17f636e4b08db990566f2b": "Friday\u2019s court ruling against the Affordable Care Act is so bonkers that even the law\u2019s staunchest and most strident critics are trashing it.\n\nJudge Reed O\u2019Connor, from the federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, held that the 2010 health care law is unconstitutional. Not much is going to change right away, as the state attorneys general defending the law have promised to appeal the decision to the Circuit Court of Appeals and, if need be, to the U.S. Supreme Court after that.\n\nThe process could take months and possibly years. The Trump administration, despite its unwavering criticism of \u201cObamacare\u201d and refusal to defend the law in court, has already said it will continue to manage the program as before \u2014 which means that the tens of millions of Americans who depend on it for insurance are safe for now.\n\nBut that would change if O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling prevails on appeal and the law really comes off the books.\n\nFull repeal of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment, is a goal most conservatives have long sought. And yet since O\u2019Connor issued his decision, prominent conservatives have been speaking out against it.\n\nOne explanation for these warnings is that these writers genuinely see the ruling as an affront, both to their own conservative ideals and to broader principles of law.\n\nEven the high priests of anti-Obama conservativism at the Wall Street Journal opinion page couldn\u2019t bring themselves to support the ruling. In an editorial with the headline \u201cTexas Obamacare Blunder,\u201d they offer a point-by-point rebuttal to the ruling that sounds pretty much the same as what liberal critics have been saying.\n\nThe crux of the case is the individual mandate, which is the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance and which falls to zero starting in January, because that\u2019s what Republicans in Congress decided to do as part of the tax cut bill they passed and that President Donald Trump signed last year.\n\nO\u2019Connor said that change renders the mandate unconstitutional, because, in a 2012 decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act, the majority opinion from Chief Justice Roberts justified the mandate as an exercise of congressional authority to levy taxes \u2015 and a financial penalty of zero value can\u2019t be a tax, O\u2019Connor ruled.\n\nThat part of the ruling, though debatable, is relatively unimportant. But O\u2019Connor proceeded to rule that the rest of the law can\u2019t stand, either, because when Congress wrote the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it thought the mandate was essential to its functioning \u2015 which means that, with no mandate, the rest of the law can\u2019t work either.\n\nAs Adler, Klein, the Journal editorial page and others \u2015 left as well as right \u2015 keep pointing out, this argument fails on several grounds. Under clearly established, well-understood standards for \u201cseverability,\u201d judges who find parts of a law unconstitutional are supposed to seek the least disruptive remedies possible.\n\n\u201cWhen one part of a statute is ruled unconstitutional, courts are not supposed to strike down other parts of the same law unless they are inextricably connected and Congress would not have intended the latter to function without the former,\u201d Somin wrote for Reason\u2019s Volokh Conspiracy blog.\n\n\u201cThe principle presumes that, out of respect for the separation of powers, courts will leave the rest of the statute standing unless Congress makes clear it did not intend for the law to exist without the challenged provision,\u201d Adler and a liberal co-author, Yale law professor Abbe Gluck, wrote in a New York Times op-ed. \u201cIt is an uncontroversial rule that every Supreme Court justice in modern history has applied.\u201d\n\nAdler and Gluck go on to note that sometimes it\u2019s tricky figuring out what Congress intended, because a statute is old or lawmakers didn\u2019t address an issue head-on. Neither condition is true in this case, they and the other conservatives note.\n\nThe debate over the tax bill happened just one year ago and, after that debate was done, Congress decided to eliminate the mandate penalty fully aware that the rest of the Affordable Care Act would remain in place. Whether or not that was a wise decision, the conservatives note, it was clearly intentional \u2015 and O\u2019Connor should have respected that.\n\n\u201cWhen Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorialists noted. \u201cWhen judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.\u201d\n\nKlein agreed, noting that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to see how the mandate can be seen as inseparable from Obamacare after Congress just acted to separate it.\u201d\n\nOne explanation for these warnings is that these writers genuinely see the ruling as an affront, both to their own conservative ideals and to broader principles of law that are supposed to transcend typical ideological divisions.\n\n\u201cThis is an embarrassingly bad decision, and if a liberal judge had issued something like it goring a conservative ox, conservatives would be rightly up in arms,\u201d Ted Frank, director of litigation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, wrote in a tweet.\n\nThe more cynical interpretation of these condemnations is that the conservatives are simply thinking about the political blowback to Republicans as the case proceeds and, especially, if eventually it succeeds \u2014 taking away financial support and insurance protections for millions.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial raises this possibility explicitly and repeatedly, reminding Republicans of how Democrats successfully used the lawsuit as a political attack during the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cDemocrats campaigned across the country against [the lawsuit] to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020,\u201d the Journal editorial stated.\n\nWhatever the motives of conservatives, the objections to this case represent a striking contrast to the reception that the last two legal attacks on the Affordable Care Act had. In both of those cases, conservatives were mostly united in support.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorado-supreme-court-fracking-jared-polis_us_5c3d0696e4b01c93e00cb51e": "DENVER \u2015 Environmental activists here were dealt a blow Monday when the Colorado Supreme Court ruled against a closely watched case that would have required the state to prioritize health and environmental concerns in oil and gas permitting.\n\nBut with a newly Democratic legislature and governor in the state promising to take another look at the fracking debate, environmentalists are optimistic that they can pursue a successful strategy in the statehouse.\n\n\u201cThis decision really validates everything that we\u2019ve been saying, that this state is not prioritizing public health and safety, and that regulations are not sufficient,\u201d said Anne Lee Foster of Colorado Rising, a group opposed to the hydraulic fracturing drilling technique known as fracking. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that this is a real issue impacting Coloradans every day, and we\u2019re going to keep fighting until the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the hands of the legislators now,\u201d she added.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision caps a five-year legal fight brought by six youth activists from Boulder County. The activists, led by Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, filed a petition with the state\u2019s oil and gas regulatory body in 2013 asking that new permits be suspended until a comprehensive scientific study could show that new activity would be safe. When the petition was denied, the activists sued and ultimately won a favorable decision in the Martinez case in the state\u2019s Appeals Court last spring.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling overturns that interpretation, leaving existing policy in place. The state, the court found, was right to continue to interpret permits by weighing \u201ccost-effectiveness and technical feasibility\u201d against adverse effects on health and the environmental.\n\nThe case was closely watched along Colorado\u2019s Front Range, where the fracking boom has put wells near playgrounds, parks and schools (Extraction Oil and Gas infamously installed a fracking site just 1,360 feet from the largely minority Bella Romero Academy in Greeley.) Concerns about worsening air quality and health effects, such as increased cancer risks, have led to lawsuits and community actions, including an unsuccessful ballot measure in November to increase well setbacks, requiring that they be located at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings.\n\nHelen H. Richardson via Getty Images Anti-fracking protesters in Colorado rally earlier this month for a moratorium on new oil and gas wells.\n\nThe advent of hydraulic fracturing \u2015 which involves shooting pressurized liquid into shale formations \u2015 in the early 2000s allowed companies to reach untapped reservoirs of oil and gas. Colorado now has more than 56,000 active oil and gas wells, producing more than 1.7 million cubic feet of natural gas, the sixth most in the country.\n\nThe oil and gas industry applauded the Martinez case decision. The ruling \u201cwill continue to allow for development, while also protecting our environment,\u201d Dan Haley, president and CEO of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThose who filed this lawsuit have said they want to ban oil and natural gas development in Colorado, so we\u2019re happy to see the Supreme Court strike down this extreme effort and shortsighted agenda,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the relief may not last long. A blue wave in the November midterm elections hit Colorado especially hard, installing Democratic majorities in the statehouse and throughout the administration. New Democratic Gov. Jared Polis campaigned on giving communities a larger voice in fracking decisions, a promise he reiterated in his State of the State address last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to take meaningful action to address the conflicts between oil-and-gas drilling operators and the neighborhoods that they impact,\u201d Polis said. \u201cWe will work to make sure that every community has clean air and water. And this is a vital quality-of-life issue for Colorado families.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Monday, Polis said that he was disappointed in the court\u2019s ruling and that it \u201conly highlights the need to work with the Legislature and the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission to more safely develop our state\u2019s natural resources and protect our citizens from harm.\u201d\n\nPolis had previously pushed a number of anti-fracking ballot measures, including a 2,000-foot setback (while running for governor this year, Polis did not endorse the larger setback) and an environmental bill of rights. In a compromise with then-Gov. John Hickenlooper in 2014 that took the measures off the ballot, Polis helped create a task force to weigh local control and environmental impacts.\n\nCommunities in every corner of our state want to know that their health and safety are being prioritized when it comes to oil and gas operations. Democratic State House Speaker KC Becker\n\nActivist groups like Colorado Rising have asked Polis for a moratorium on new drilling, which is unlikely to happen, but they say they\u2019re encouraged that Democrats could reinvigorate that debate. Democrats have discussed a number of potential bills that would codify the demands of the Martinez case or give local communities more power to say no to drilling (a state Supreme Court decision in 2016 barred townships and counties from passing fracking bans). As with the 2014 commission, any new debate is likely to be closely watched by states like Texas and Pennsylvania, which are dealing with their own fracking booms.\n\nState House Speaker KC Becker, a Democrat from Boulder, said that the court ruling \u201cputs the decision back into the hands of lawmakers to take action, and we are committed to addressing this concern in this legislative session.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunities in every corner of our state want to know that their health and safety are being prioritized when it comes to oil and gas operations,\u201d she added.\n\nIn an interview, Martinez, now 18, said the court ruling reaffirmed that newly elected Democrats needed to listen to community concerns. \u201cIf these politicians don\u2019t recognize their responsibility to work with us and the people affected by this crisis, we\u2019ll vote you out,\u201d he said.\n\nEven though Colorado politicians have usually been hesitant to regulate the lucrative fossil-fuel industry, Martinez said the rising tide of health concerns should elevate the debate.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neomi-rao-college-op-eds_us_5c3cd59de4b01c93e00c656c": "Neomi Rao, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, once called race a \u201chot, money-making issue\u201d and suggested women who are raped while they are drunk should bear some responsibility for their attacks, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nThe comments were discovered in a series of op-eds Rao wrote between 1994 and 1996, directly before and after she graduated from Yale University, that resurfaced in the wake of her nomination.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images Neomi Rao currently serves as head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n\nIn one 1994 op-ed for the Yale Herald, titled \u201cShades of Gray,\u201d Rao expounded on her views on consent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to a lot of fraternity parties on this campus.

The 10-9 vote was along party lines, with every Democrat on the committee opposed.\n\nUnder current rules, senators have up to 30 hours to debate a nominee after they have voted to advance the nomination to a final vote \u2015 otherwise known as post-cloture time. Republicans say Democrats are wildly abusing this process to slow the confirmation of many noncontroversial lower court and administrative nominees. They point out that some government agencies are having to run with a bare-bones staff because many of their lower-ranking administrative nominees are still awaiting a confirmation vote.\n\nThe GOP proposal, which was introduced by committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and by James Lankford (R-Okla.), would limit that post-cloture debate time to two hours per nominee \u2015 significantly speeding up the process. It\u2019s similar to a temporary deal on nominations that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) negotiated with Republicans in 2013 \u2015 except the Blunt proposal would change the rules permanently.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to abuse the system like Democrats have been and not expect for people to try to end that abuse,\u201d Blunt told HuffPost last week.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees for lower-level government posts have had an unusually high number of calls for Senate cloture votes to cut off debate and move to the final vote, according to the Pew Research Center. However, Republicans employed the tactic of drawing out debate with equal zeal to slow the confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees after his re-election in 2012, a pattern that led to Reid\u2019s rules change in 2013.\n\nMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will.

Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the rules committee, said during the markup hearing that Republicans are pursuing the change \u201conly because they want to ram more nominees through.\u201d She noted that part of the reason some government agencies aren\u2019t running at full capacity is that the White House simply hasn\u2019t nominated anyone to the posts.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal; this is not just a minor proposal to come our way,\u201d Klobuchar said on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the proposal was reported favorably out of committee on Wednesday, it will likely fall short of the 60-vote threshold necessary for final passage due to Democratic opposition. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier this week that he would oppose it unless Republicans agree to move the threshold on Supreme Court nominations back up to 60 votes or restore the use of \u201cblue slips\u201d over judicial nominees. Republicans abandoned the long-standing tradition after Trump\u2019s election, a practice that has been followed by both parties for decades and allows senators from a nominee\u2019s state to express their opinion on the individual.\n\nRepublicans suggested on Wednesday that they intend to move forward and pass the new rules proposal unilaterally by going \u201cnuclear\u201d on the Senate floor \u2015 a move that would require only 51 votes for approval.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will,\u201d Sen.

The recipient could begin as early as January and would be tasked with covering social movements and protests of the kind Barkan has led and championed.\n\nAlthough the fellowship is currently a one-time opportunity, The Intercept would ultimately like to fund a year-long fellowship in Barkan\u2019s honor every year, according to Ryan Grim, the outlet\u2019s Washington bureau chief. (Grim, who ran HuffPost\u2019s Washington bureau until June 2017, previously edited this reporter\u2019s work.)\n\nGrim was covering Barkan\u2019s protests of the Kavanaugh confirmation and approached him with the idea for the fellowship.

As a leader at the Center for Popular Democracy, which advocates for low-income communities, Barkan pioneered the Fed Up campaign in 2014, which successfully nudged the Federal Reserve in a more progressive direction.\n\nIn October 2016, Barkan was diagnosed with ALS, a terminal disease that slowly paralyzes people. Barkan, who has a two-year-old son with his wife Rachael King, renewed his commitment to rank-and-file activism, vowing to do everything in his remaining days to stop President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, beginning with the proposed tax cuts.\n\n\u201cI can joke or say honestly that if I\u2019m gonna die really young, I wanna go down swinging, in a blaze of glory,\u201d Barkan told HuffPost in December 2017.\n\nBarkan began speaking publicly about his condition and became a leading figure in progressive protests against the GOP tax cut legislation on Capitol Hill. Relying increasingly on a wheelchair to get around, the steady progress of ALS slurring his voice, he spent weeks lobbying potential swing votes in the Senate Republican Caucus. He argued that the nearly $2 trillion the tax cuts added to the national debt would eventually be used to justify cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2015 endangering programs he would depend on as his illness worsened.\n\nDuring each visit from his home in Santa Barbara, California, to protest the tax cuts on Capitol Hill, Barkan would be arrested for civil disobedience while telling his personal story with the help of fellow activists, who repeated his words in an Occupy Wall Street-style \u201chuman mic.\u201d Despite Barkan\u2019s failing health, his leadership moved numerous people to get involved, according to Winnie Wong, a co-founder of The People for Bernie Sanders who got to know Barkan during protests against the tax cuts and the Kavanaugh confirmation.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he is leading in this moment is extremely inspiring because he simply doesn\u2019t have the physical strength to be doing this,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAs someone who is still very healthy and active, every time I see him being carted away to the Capitol Police holding pen where he has to sit and be processed for his civil disobedience action, my heart breaks.\u201d\n\nDavid Stubbs/Reuters Ady Barkan speaks to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen during the inaugural Fed Up protest in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 23, 2014.\n\nBarkan\u2019s activism became national news when he confronted Sen.

In a video conversation that went viral, Barkan told Flake to \u201cbe a hero\u201d and vote against the tax legislation.\n\nFlake, who listened patiently during their airplane meeting, did not heed Barkan\u2019s request. But thanks to the chance encounter, Barkan succeeded in drawing attention to the tax fight and its human ramifications. What\u2019s more, the phrase \u201cbe a hero\u201d became the namesake of both a nonprofit and political action committee Barkan launched to continue his work.\n\nBarkan\u2019s \u201cBe a Hero\u201d PAC crowdfunded six-figure ad buys highlighting his story in the special elections in Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District in April and Ohio\u2019s 12th in August. (The PAC, which benefits from Barkan\u2019s inspiring story and now-mammoth social media following, is spending some $5 million on advertising in 100 congressional districts.)\n\nBarkan returned to Capitol Hill over the summer to help fight Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. His body weaker and his voice harder to understand, he continued to pour his strength into speaking out against the then-nominee to the Supreme Court, joining legions of other activists arrested in acts of civil disobedience.\n\nBarkan estimates he has been arrested at least seven times in Capitol Hill protests since he first began demonstrating there in late 2017.\n\n\u2018If Susan Collins votes to confirm this terrible nominee we will use your money to replace her with someone better in 2020.

The initiative rattled Collins, who routinely raises money from corporate PACs but called the effort tantamount to bribery.\n\nBarkan and his allies crowdfunded nearly $4 million for a potential Collins challenger. She nonetheless went on to vote for Kavanaugh, which most observers believe she was set to do regardless.\n\nIn the process, however, Barkan innovated a new form of grassroots organizing and kickstarted the Democratic campaign against Collins two years before her next Election Day in 2020. The pressure campaign against Collins, like Barkan\u2019s Federal Reserve organizing before that, showcased his talent for \u201ccreating new angles\u201d and \u201cdisrupting\u201d institutions like Congress, according to Grim.\n\n\u201cThe work that he does is so unique in that in some ways, it felt like it needed a unique position to cover it,\u201d Grim said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/midwestern-republicans-try-to-kneecap-new-democratic-governors_us_5c05acebe4b0cd916faefc3e": "Reuters Republicans are trying to hamper Wisconsin Gov.-elect Tony Evers before he's even sworn into office.\n\nLame-duck Republican legislatures in two Midwestern states where Democrats seized key state offices in November are trying to kneecap the incoming leaders and change election rules, aiming to consolidate GOP power despite the election results.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republicans aim to limit early voting, change the date of the state\u2019s presidential primary to help a conservative member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court win re-election, limit the governor\u2019s ability to make certain appointments and block Gov.-elect Tony Evers from eliminating a state economic development agency.\n\nTo the east, Michigan\u2019s GOP legislators are looking to limit the power of the state\u2019s attorney general and secretary of state over lawsuits and campaign finance reforms. Democrats will take over from Republicans in the two offices.\n\nIn both states, the lawmakers are mimicking what happened in North Carolina in 2016, after Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, ousted Republican Pat McCrory. Before Cooper took office, the GOP-dominated Legislature moved to limit his power to make appointments, and it has since consistently tried to alter election rules to help Republicans. Cooper has managed to successfully fight some of the changes with lawsuits.\n\nMichigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina are all presidential battlegrounds, and in all three states district lines for House and state legislative seats have been heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans. The GOP continues to control both chambers of the legislatures in each state, and Republican leaders want to limit the ability of Democrats to undercut the advances they have made in their conservative agendas.\n\nThe last election changed the state in a way that apparently the Legislature has decided to not accept. Wisconsin Gov.-elect Tony Evers (D)\n\nFor now, the situation in Wisconsin is most alarming to Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe last election changed the state in a way that apparently the Legislature has decided to not accept,\u201d Evers said Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nEvers, who defeated two-term Gov. Scott Walker, and his allies remain hopeful the GOP proposals won\u2019t pass and get signed into law, but some progressive groups have already begun discussing lawsuits.\n\nIn an interview with a conservative talk radio host, Wisconsin\u2019s state Senate majority leader was blunt when asked why the changes were necessary: to water down the power of the governor\u2019s office before Evers is in the job.\n\n\u201cWe trusted Scott Walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the Legislature,\u201d Sen. Scott Fitzgerald said, calling Democratic protests \u201cmanufactured outrage.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe don\u2019t trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas.\u201d\n\nA key Wisconsin legislative committee held a hearing on the bills on Monday, and a vote could come as early as Tuesday. While the GOP has a large majority in Wisconsin\u2019s Assembly, they have a much smaller margin in the Senate, where just two Republican defections could doom the legislation. The state\u2019s chapter of Indivisible and other grassroots groups are organizing protests and putting pressure on GOP senators from swing districts.\n\nBarry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin and the director of its Elections Research Center, said Republicans were \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d after losing all five statewide races this fall.\n\n\u201cWhat the Republicans have left is the Supreme Court and the state Legislature,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe moving of the primary is a way to protect a conservative justice on the Supreme Court, and they\u2019ve said that very openly. There\u2019s nothing secret to them about that. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d\n\nThe plan would move the date of the state\u2019s 2020 presidential primary from April to March, while keeping the election for the court seat in April. With a competitive Democratic presidential race and no real GOP challenge to President Donald Trump, liberal turnout is likely to be sky-high. By separating the presidential primary from the court contest,, Republicans hope a conservative judge will have a better shot at re-election.\n\nSixty of the 72 county clerks in Wisconsin oppose moving the primary date. On Monday, the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously to send written testimony to the Legislature saying that moving the primary date would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d and could cost the state between $6.4 and $6.8 million.\n\nBurden said that if the Republicans were successful in jamming through the last-minute changes, it could set an alarming precedent for lawmakers when future changes in statewide offices occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. One of the things that the Senate majority leader said today is that they were doing these things because they didn\u2019t trust the incoming governor. Well, doing these kinds of things actually sows mistrust,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts \u201cto try to ram through a bunch of things before (a new governor) can even have a say\u201dis going to \u201ctaint relations between the legislative branch and the executive branch immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nReuters Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer was one of a host of Democratic women elected statewide in Michigan.\n\nDemocrats are more hopeful they\u2019ll be able to stop the proposed changes in Michigan, where Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer won her race by a healthy margin and where outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Snyder has stayed neutral toward the Republican legislation.\n\nIt was the Republican effort in North Carolina to strip power from Cooper before he took office that provided a model for Wisconsin legislators to borrow from, said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a good government group.\n\n\u201cThe fact that North Carolina was able to do that to... Cooper and that the lame-duck Republican [governor] was there long enough to be able to sign some of the legislation to curtail some of the power of the new governor... I think this was something that the Republican legislative leaders looked at\u201d in Wisconsin, he said.\n\nThe Democratic Governors\u2019 Association, which spent heavily to help elect Evers and Whitmer, predicted the GOP attempts to curtail the new governors\u2019 would prove self-defeating.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-brett-kavanaugh-honor_us_5be5596de4b0769d24cbe38c": "Melania Trump was criticized after she tweeted about the \u201chonor\u201d of new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh .\n\nThe first lady joined President Donald Trump for Kavanaugh\u2019s ceremonial swearing-in on Thursday.

Here are five of the most notable:\n\n1. Trump claimed without evidence that Californians are \u201crioting\u201d in protest of \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we like sanctuary cities up here,\u201d Trump told the crowd after criticizing Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) on her immigration record. Rosen is running for the Senate against Republican incumbent Dean Heller, whom the president endorses.\n\nTrump continued: \u201cBy the way, a lot of people in California don\u2019t like them either. They\u2019re rioting now. They want to get out of their sanctuary cities.\u201d\n\nIt is true that people in more than a dozen California cities have taken action against their state\u2019s so-called sanctuary cities laws, which limit local authorities from fully cooperating with federal immigration authorities. But there is no evidence of rioting in the state over the issue.\n\n2. Trump once again said without evidence that the caravan of Central American migrants headed for the U.S. is full of criminals.\n\nTrump returned to immigration at many points throughout his speech, particularly to stir up fears over a caravan of mostly Honduran migrants walking across Central America to the U.S. border in order to request asylum. He said, despite evidence to the contrary, that the group will bring waves of crime and drugs over the border.\n\n\u201cThis country doesn\u2019t want them,\u201d Trump said of the caravan.\n\nHe also claimed to have \u201calready figured out\u201d what to do about the approaching group \u2015 which is more than 3,000 strong \u2015 but said he can\u2019t reveal his plan until after the midterms.\n\n3. Trump stated that \u201cRepublicans will always protect people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nWith health care a major concern for voters, Trump and a number of other Republicans have gone on the defensive by repeatedly claiming they want to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, is backing a lawsuit seeking to scrap pre-existing condition coverage as required by the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law.\n\nSimilarly, Heller last year voted for the Republican party\u2019s health care bill, which ultimately failed but would have hurt people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n4. Trump blamed the \u201cfake news media\u201d for his low approval ratings.\n\nTrump bashed journalists once again, just two days after celebrating a Montana lawmaker who \u201cbody-slammed\u201d a reporter for The Guardian. While Trump has always had a difficult relationship with journalists, the timing of that comment \u2015 as it became all but certain a Saudi reporter who\u2019d been living in the U.S. had been murdered by Saudi operatives \u2015 earned him special criticism.\n\nIn Nevada, Trump said the \u201cfake news media\u201d is Democrats\u2019 \u201csingle greatest ally,\u201d pointing to reporters at the scene and eliciting boos from the crowd. If only the media were on his side, Trump said, his approval rating would be at \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\n5. Dean Heller told the president everything he touches \u201cturns to gold.\u201d\n\nAfter an introduction by Trump, Heller took the stage to sing the president\u2019s praises, not mentioning the time Trump threatened the senator\u2019s seat unless he voted with the Republican majority on its attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you know a little bit about gold,\u201d Heller said, recalling the importance of the state\u2019s mining industry. \u201cIn fact, I think everything you touch turns to gold.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-her-stories-little-mix-feminist-album_us_5bfbed42e4b0771fb6bb71e8": "Associated Press Devotees carrying customary offerings on their heads arrive to worship at the Sabarimala temple, one of the world's largest Hindu pilgrimage sites in Kerala state, India, on Nov. 5. The historic temple, which had barred women age 10 to 50 from entering, opened to Hindu pilgrims for a day. The last time it was opened, conservative protesters blocked women of menstruating age from going to the temple, defying a recent ruling from India's top court to let them enter.\n\n\u201cHuffPost Her Stories\u201d is a new series highlighting HuffPost\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s lives from across our 15 global editions.

It was a groundbreaking but deeply controversial decision, and still no woman has entered the shrine to Lord Ayyappa in the southern state of Kerala. Violent protesters blocked the first women who attempted the steep trek to the hillside Sabarimala temple complex. The threats followed the women back home, where some even encountered violence, HuffPost India reported.\n\nIncredibly, none of this has deterred hundreds of other women from registering to visit the holy site during the ongoing pilgrimage season. HuffPost India\u2019s Chithira Vijayakumar spoke with three of them \u2014 a young developer, a housewife and school teacher \u2014 about their decisions to embark on the risky journey.\n\n\u201cThese interviews, and subsequent interactions I\u2019ve had with other women who plan to climb, challenge two of the dominant narratives that exist vis-\u00e0-vis the Sabarimala issue,\u201d Chithira explained. \u201cThe first is the straw feminist argument that the women who want to make the climb are only doing it to \u2018prove a point.\u2019 ... The second one is that this is a plan masterminded by the Left, to destroy the sanctity of Sabarimala, and part of a larger ploy to attack and weaken Hindu faith.\u201d\n\nThe framing of the conflict as one between true devotees and godless feminist activists, Chithira said, is \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor one, the original case for the entry of women was filed as a public interest litigation by a few members of the Indian Young Lawyers Association, and not a feminist organization,\u201d she said. \u201cSecondly, the women who are observing the fast to visit the forest shrine seem to be motivated by a genuine curiosity about the effects of pilgrimage, as well as an abiding sense of faith.\u201c\n\nChithira\u2019s piece is an engrossing read about faith and courage in the face of intimidation, as well as the complex views the devout have about women and tradition.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nJo Hale via Getty Images Pop group Little Mix has released an unapologetically feminist album.\n\nThe biggest female pop group in the U.K. has used its platform to send empowering messages to its young female fan base for years.

Photos published by the outlet show land surveyors and Border Patrol vehicles on property owned by the Butterfly Center.\n\n\u201cJust like farmers get crop yield in acres and inches, we get butterflies based on what we have planted in acres and inches,\u201d she told the Express-News. \u201cSo having a wide swath of our property bulldozed is going to negatively impact the volume of the species and diversity of the species.\u201d\n\nAn Instagram post from the center warns that construction will destroy habitat, contribute to flooding and block migration routes for animals \u2015 including species of birds and butterflies that fly relatively low to the ground.\n\nNPR notes that Customs and Border Protection denies it will clear the land completely. When asked for comment by HuffPost, a CBP spokesman pointed to the \u201cEnvironmental and Cultural Stewardship\u201d page on the agency\u2019s website.\n\nAs The Intercept reported in November, the center provides habitat for migrating monarch butterflies \u2015 a threatened species \u2015 as well as the endangered ocelot and jaguarundi.\n\nAmericanWildlife via Getty Images Monarch butterflies in Mexico.\n\nThough the Butterfly Center is private property, the federal government is able to seize the land for its own use via eminent domain laws, according to NPR. But Trevino-Wright told the outlet that she was taken by surprise last year when she first spotted workers on the property surveying the land and cutting down trees. The center is in the process of suing the federal government, alleging that those workers didn\u2019t have the legal right to enter the property at the time.\n\nThat lawsuit is ongoing, but the recent outcome of a different suit filed by animal rights and environmental groups doesn\u2019t bode well for wildlife along the border. The Center for Biological Diversity, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and Defenders of Wildlife were challenging the waiver of dozens of laws \u2015 many of them environmental laws \u2015 to allow wall construction to proceed. The groups argued that a 1996 law permitting the executive branch to waive environmental regulations for border construction is unconstitutional, according to CNBC.\n\nA federal judge in San Diego sided with the Trump administration in February. The groups appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear their case on Monday, meaning that the earlier ruling will remain in place.\n\nNumerous environmental experts have warned that Trump\u2019s proposed border wall would be catastrophic for animal and plant life in the region. In July, a scathing scientific report condemned the planned wall as an environmental disaster that would \u201cthreaten some of the continent\u2019s most biologically diverse regions.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/military-ban-on-abortions-for-fetal-anomalies-hurts-families_us_5bf45506e4b06e295256464b": "Rose Penchansky Rose Penchansky holds her daughter after a pregnancy termination for medical reasons. Because Penchansky gets her health care coverage through the military, she had to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket to have the procedure.\n\nRose Penchansky was on the fence about whether to say something.\n\nShe was on her computer, scrolling through a closed Facebook fan group for the Hulu show \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d shortly after the midterm elections and came across a post about the news that Alabama\u2019s voters had just passed an amendment giving \u201cunborn children\u201d the \u201cright to life in all manners and measures appropriate and lawful.\u201d It reiterated the fact that the state doesn\u2019t protect abortion rights or fund the procedure \u2015 something that could set the stage for abortion to become illegal in Alabama if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nPenchansky, 33, watched members of the group debate about which abortions should be legal and which shouldn\u2019t. But after reading one too many strident posts about how abortions should be illegal or illegal after the first trimester, she knew she had to speak up about her second-trimester abortion, scheduled for just a few days later.\n\n\u201cThey did an in-depth ultrasound and discovered the baby had hydrops fetalis, pleural effusions, edema and cystic hygroma, and increased risk of Down\u2019s Syndrome and Turner\u2019s Syndrome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey did emergency amniocentesis. All of that was the easy part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided to terminate, my husband agreed,\u201d she continued. This is where it became difficult.\u201d\n\nPenchansky lives in Tennessee, and if she had had health insurance through her employer, she likely would have had coverage for the abortion. But because her husband is in the military, she instead gets her health care through Tricare Prime, the military\u2019s health management organization for family members of military personnel.\n\nAnd because of a federal law that bans the use of federal funds for abortions for fetal anomalies, the second-trimester termination cost nearly $16,000 out of pocket \u2015 something her family couldn\u2019t afford. Penchansky has turned to crowdfunding in order to meet the costs.\n\n\u201cWhen the government starts taking a woman\u2019s right away and dictating how they can use their body, so begins the slippery slope into Gilead,\u201d Penchansky wrote, referring to the name of the \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d society that enslaves fertile women. \u201cThis is happening to me right now.\u201d\n\nA federal ban on abortion funding affects millions of Americans\n\nThe federal government has banned the use of federal funds for abortions since 1976, under what is known as the Hyde Amendment. It blocks states from using federal funds from Medicaid, Medicare or Children\u2019s Health Insurance programs to pay for abortions except in two instances: when a woman\u2019s life is in danger and when the pregnancy results from rape or incest.\n\nThis amendment has been used as the basis for more laws that prevent federal funding for abortion, said the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights advocacy organization. This includes laws that prevent the military from paying for abortions for fetal anomalies and extend to anyone employed by the federal government, anyone who gets health care through Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service and people in federal prisons or immigration detention centers.\n\nThese abortion restrictions affect millions of lives, Guttmacher notes. Tricare covers more than 9 million military members and their dependents, and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program for civilian federal employees covers more than 8 million people and their dependents.\n\nBecause Penchansky was young and healthy and had a previous uncomplicated pregnancy and birth, she didn\u2019t qualify for first-trimester screening tests covered by Tricare. It wasn\u2019t until she was 17 weeks along in her pregnancy that she received the results of her first fetal screening of any kind: the quad screen, a blood test that can detect signs of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, as well as some conditions in which the brain and spinal column don\u2019t develop properly.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t good. It showed that her baby had an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and that she needed to see a specialist right away. But there was added urgency for her. Because she got her health care through the military, which doesn\u2019t cover abortions for fetal abnormality, the longer she waited, the more expensive a termination would be.\n\nShe moved as fast as she could. A week later, an in-depth ultrasound with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist revealed that half her baby girl\u2019s heart hadn\u2019t developed, she had a large fluid-filled cyst running from her head all the way down her spine and there were large accumulations of fluid in the chest cavity affecting both lungs.\n\n\u201cI pretty much had a mental breakdown in the office,\u201d Penchansky told HuffPost. \u201cMy son was with me, and I was really losing it.\u201d\n\nStill, she held on to hope for her daughter that the amniocentesis, a test that can diagnose abnormalities or birth defects, would have promising news.\n\n\u201cI told [the doctor] I wouldn\u2019t terminate unless I knew what was wrong with the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to just base it off of an ultrasound.\u201d\n\nThe results came back at week 20. Her baby was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, which the doctor had suspected because of the large spinal cysts and accumulation of fluid in her body. The chromosomal disorder, in which a female fetus has only one X chromosome instead of two, results in miscarriage 99 percent of the time.\n\nThe doctor talked to Penchansky about the \u201clethal nature\u201d of the combination of the baby\u2019s Turner syndrome, half-formed heart and growing cysts, according to a medical record of the appointment.\n\nShe decided to end the pregnancy as soon as possible rather than prolong the baby\u2019s suffering or expose herself to the risk of delivering of a full-term baby with extremely large cystic growths.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring a baby into the world that has a 1 percent chance of making it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m either going to watch her pass away early on, or she\u2019s going to suffer.\u201d\n\nAn abortion that far along is an anomaly in the U.S. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions performed in this country happen after 21 weeks gestation.\n\nHow abortion restrictions make a tragic situation stressful\n\nThe federal restrictions on abortions for fetal anomalies, in combination with state laws that continue to close abortion clinics or make the window of legal abortion smaller, mean more pressure on women and their families in what are already difficult circumstances.\n\nDr. Neil Silverman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles, wasn\u2019t involved in Penchansky\u2019s case but reviewed her anonymized medical records.\n\nHe said that women like her are dealt a severe blow when they receive news about fatal fetal anomalies and that the situation is made worse by the \u201cexternal forces\u201d like gestational age cutoffs for abortions, restrictions on medical counseling and waiting periods for abortion that encroach on discussions between patients and doctors.\n\n\u201cI feel strongly that what I might do personally is not what any given woman or family might do, and counseling needs to be able to take all options into consideration, not just pregnancy termination,\u201d said Silverman, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. \u201cThat said, termination can\u2019t be limited by external forces from the critical patient-physician discussion.\u201d\n\nPenchansky agreed. She said the lack of health insurance coverage for the procedure turned an already trying and difficult period of life for her into something stressful and expensive too.\n\nAfter deciding to terminate, she listened to her baby\u2019s heartbeat with a Doppler fetal monitor every day, but now with the hope that the baby inside her would die before her scheduled abortion.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t find a heartbeat, I can go down to labor and delivery on the Army base,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey can check, confirm, and then [I] wind up with the dilation and evacuation on the Army base \u2015 and Tricare will pay for it.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t end up happening.\n\nInstead, she went through with the abortion \u2015 an induced birth, because she was so far along and the baby\u2019s heart was still beating \u2015 on Nov 15. But by the time she gave birth, the baby no longer had a heartbeat.\n\n\u201cMy body thinks I have a baby to feed, my belly is still swollen, and I have typical bleeding,\u201d wrote Penchansky in an email to HuffPost a few days after the procedure. \u201cI have moments where I keep busy and don\u2019t think about it, and moments where something triggers me and I break down.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to grieving the loss of their very much wanted baby girl, she keeps ruminating on the cost of the abortion.\n\nPenchansky said she believes that if she could have had a screening test like a nuchal translucency scan in the first trimester, the problems would have been caught sooner \u2015 and she could have easily afforded a $1,000 first trimester abortion at a local Planned Parenthood. In the end, her parents ended up lending her $10,000 for the second-trimester abortion.\n\nSilverman said that it was difficult to say at this point whether the baby\u2019s issues would have been visible in a first-trimester ultrasound but that it was possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that with a large fluid collection like a cystic hygroma seen in the second trimester, that the nuchal translucency typically measured on ultrasound in the first trimester as a screening test might have been enlarged as well,\u201d he said. This would have then triggered more diagnostic testing like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis earlier, which would have found the Turner syndrome faster.\n\nKevin Dwyer, a spokesman for Tricare, didn\u2019t comment directly on Penchansky\u2019s case but said that the health plan complies with federal laws banning abortion except when the mother\u2019s life is in danger or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\n\nHe also said that Tricare\u2019s schedule for ultrasounds and other prenatal care is in line with guidelines published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recommends a first-trimester ultrasound only if the mother has certain symptoms or risk factors.\n\nLike many other military family members during deployment, Penchansky went through all this without her spouse by her side.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in a statement on Saturday as the panel\u2019s Republican majority released a 414-page report. \u201cIn the end, there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against the nominee.\u201d\n\nIn the accusation that gained the most public attention, California professor Christine Blasey Ford testified to the committee that when they were both teenagers, a drunk Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothing and pressed his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream at a house party.\n\nYale University classmate Deborah Ramirez also said that a drunken Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party and thrust his penis into her face. Additionally, high school and college classmates said publicly before Kavanaugh was confirmed that he was a heavy drinker.\n\nKavanaugh in his testimony denied all of the allegations of sexual misconduct and disputed characterizations that he had a drinkng problem.\n\nAccording to the Senate Judiciary Committee report, six FBI reports on Kavanaugh over the course of his career in politics and on the bench \u2015 probes that included interviews with nearly 150 individuals who knew him \u2015 \u201cdid not reveal any alcohol abuse or inappropriate sexual behavior.\u201d\n\nThe report included speculation by two men that Ford may have mistaken them for Kavanaugh during innocent encounters decades ago. The names of the men were redacted.\n\nBefore Ford\u2019s testimony, conservative lawyer Ed Whelan suggested in a strange series of tweets that a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s who looked like him may have assaulted her. President Donald Trump also gave credence to the theory. Ford said in her testimony that she was \u201c100 percent\u201d certain she was assaulted by Kavanaugh.\n\nGenerally, interviews in the committee report concerning Kavanaugh were glowing while questions were raised about Ford\u2019s credibility.\n\nOne person interviewed who claimed to know Ford said she did drugs on occasion. The type of drugs were not specified.\n\nAnother woman said she had seen an old photo of Ford with billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. Another said Ford had a \u201crobust\u201d social life and did not seem to be suffering from the effects of a sexual assault.\n\nThe report concluded: \u201cCommittee investigators found no verifiable evidence that supported Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. The witnesses that Dr. Ford identified as individuals who could corroborate her allegations failed to do so, and in fact, contradicted her.\u201d\n\nIn the Ramirez case, the report took note of a public statement by James Roche, who was Kavanaugh\u2019s roommate at Yale. He \u201ccharacterized Justice Kavanaugh as a \u2018notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time\u2019 who \u2018became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk,\u2019\u201d the report said.\n\nBut an unidentified classmate said Kavanaugh\u2019s drinking was \u201cwithin range of what was normal at the time.\u201d That classmate added that those who accused Kavanaugh of heavy drinking \u201cwere engaged in the same behavior.\u201d\n\nCommittee investigators \u201cfound no verifiable evidence to support Ramirez\u2019s allegations,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAs for Julie Swetnick, who told NBC that Kavanaugh was present in a house during high school when she said she was sexually assaulted, the committee \u201cfound no verifiable evidence to support\u201d her allegations.\n\nThe report added: \u201cIndeed, the evidence appears to support the position that Julie Swetnick and [her attorney, Michael] Avenatti criminally conspired to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nTheir names have been forwarded to the Department of Justice and FBI for further investigation, according to the report.\n\nOther allegations with few details and largely unknown to the public were also dismissed by the committee. Judy Munro-Leighton admitted that she falsely claimed to have authored an anonymous letter alleging that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her. The true author of the letter remains unknown and Munro-Leighton admitted she had never met Kavanaugh.

Kamala Harris, who has unveiled game-changing proposals on housing and taxes, and made a mark with her questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, kicked off a canvass in North Milwaukee on Sunday. On Monday morning, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 the grandfather of progressive politics, who turned Medicare-for-All and debt-free college tuition into primary litmus tests \u2014 came to the city\u2019s branch of the University of Wisconsin.\n\nEvers showed, and spoke briefly, at each event. But he wasn\u2019t the main draw for either politician \u2014 both spoke effusively about his ticket-mate, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. And he wasn\u2019t a headliner \u2014 Nina Turner, the former Ohio State senator who leads Our Revolution spoke after Evers, and for longer, at Sanders\u2019 rally.\n\nThe big Democratic names are still coming \u2014 former President Barack Obama visited later in the week, and former Vice President Joe Biden was in the state on Tuesday. But Evers and Wisconsin Democrats don\u2019t mind that their candidate, Wisconsin\u2019s 66-year-old Superintendent of Public Instruction, isn\u2019t the center of attention.\n\nPolls show Evers with Democrats\u2019 best chance ever of defeating Republican Gov. Scott Walker, whose moves to crush unions and subsequent political survival have made him public enemy number one for Badger State liberals. Democratic enthusiasm in the state \u2014 helped by opposition to Trump, the presence of progressive Sen. Baldwin on the ballot, and long-standing antipathy to Walker \u2014 remains high.\n\nWhile Democrats in Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona have picked young politicians of color \u2014 Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and David Garcia, respectively \u2014 as their gubernatorial nominees in hopes of firing up Democratic voters who often don\u2019t show in midterm election years, Democrats across the Rust Belt have instead selected experienced technocrats, and are pitching themselves to swing voters as the solution to America\u2019s political chaos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just who I am,\u201d Evers said of his low-key, low-drama, low-excitement style in a phone interview a few hours after his rally with Sanders. \u201cI think people are sick of polarization, and sick of not getting things done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tack Democrats are pursuing throughout the Midwest, nominating a self-proclaimed nerd in Ohio\u2019s Richard Cordray, a deal-cutting legislative insider in Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, and a buttoned-down businessman in Iowa\u2019s Fred Hubbell. All are promising to end one type of chaos or another: Hubbell is promising to undo a flawed privatization of Medicaid; and Whitmer\u2019s modest major policy promises are to \u201cfix the damn roads\u201d and end the water crisis in Flint. Evers is focused on protecting pre-existing conditions and fixing the state\u2019s potholes, which he calls \u201cScottholes.\u201d\n\nAnd it could be replicated in 2020. With President Donald Trump\u2019s White House in constant flux, his rhetoric\u2019s divisiveness increasing without apparent end and more Americans describing themselves as \u201cexhausted\u201d by politics, Democratic strategists have begun musing that the best way to defeat Trump may be to go boring.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the matchup between Evers and Walker \u2014 whose eight-year tenure has included mass protests of his union-busting bill at the state capitol, followed by a recall attempt and a presidential run \u2014 that provides the clearest test of the strategy.\n\n\u201cDemocratic candidates in the Midwest are pushing back on Donald Trump\u2019s chaos with competence,\u201d Democratic Governors\u2019 Association spokesman Jared Leopold said. \u201cVoters want steady leaders who\u2019ll get things done and fight back against wrong-headed policies from D.C.\u201d\n\nEvers doesn\u2019t push back too hard against the \u201cboring\u201d label. In a video his campaign posted where he reads mean tweets, he responds to a missive calling him boring by noting he knows how to both dance the polka and play euchre.\n\nIn the primary, voters chose Evers over two younger, more progressive options: 41-year-old firefighters\u2019 union leader Mahlon Mitchell once described Evers as \u201clike my grandfather,\u201d and 39-year-old state legislator Kelda Roys rose concerns Evers wouldn\u2019t be able to turn out young people. Unlike Mitchell and Roys, Evers didn\u2019t support the legalization of marijuana, instead asking for a statewide referendum.\n\nAnd on another key progressive priority, health care, Evers is treading carefully. While he hammers Walker over his administration\u2019s support for repealing Obamacare\u2019s protections for pre-existing conditions, he says he supports slowly moving toward single-payer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be incremental steps for this,\u201d he said, noting he would first push for Wisconsin to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, then push for a public option in the state\u2019s Badgercare program. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a stepping stone. We can\u2019t get too far ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Walker \u2014 a preacher\u2019s son who is known to wear camouflage hunting gear and ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2014 isn\u2019t a thrill-ride of a candidate either. (The Capital Times, the major newspaper in Madison, recently dubbed the governor\u2019s race a battle of \u201cbland vs. bland.\u201d In the story, Evers said in the early \u201980s, he and his wife \u201cbelonged to the Lions Club together and did all that kind of crazy stuff.\u201d)\n\nThe Walker campaign, meanwhile, is trying to turn Evers into a figure exciting enough for Republicans to oppose. The incumbent governor has a significant spending advantage, according to operatives on both sides, and has aired 34 different ads this cycle, attacking Evers as a tax-and-spend liberal. They\u2019ve lately slammed him for plagiarizing parts of his budget documents \u2014 Evers has apologized, and said the works were improperly cited.\n\n\u201cNational Democrats are spending tens of millions of dollars targeting Wisconsin and are lining up their top surrogates to try and provide a jolt to Tony Evers\u2019 campaign and defeat Scott Walker,\u201d said Brian Reisinger, a spokesman for Walker. \u201cThe problem for Evers is all the national Democrats flooding our state only further highlight his liabilities with voters \u2014 from the tax-and-spend record of Jay Inslee to the rampant plagiarism of Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nBack at the field office in Milwaukee, a crowd of around 100 had crammed into a small room to see Harris, lining up to take selfies with her, and happily singing \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention Evers much \u2014 the two had just met \u2014 but she said Baldwin had been talking up the gubernatorial candidate.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-kavanaugh-judy-munro-leighton-twitter_us_5bdda3b9e4b04367a87cf5e0": "President Donald Trump on Saturday attempted to cast renewed doubt on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh by pointing to the recantation of one little-known accuser.\n\nThe woman, Judy Munro-Leighton, falsely claimed to have authored a \u201cJane Doe\u201d letter stating that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her \u201cseveral times\u201d in the back seat of a car, which the judge denies.\n\nThe true author of the letter remains unknown, and the claim was not widely reported on during the September confirmation hearings.\n\n\u201cA vicious accuser of Justice Kavanaugh has just admitted that she was lying, her story was totally made up, or FAKE!\u201d Trump said in a tweet after initially misspelling the judge\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if he didn\u2019t become a Justice of the Supreme Court because of her disgusting False Statements,\u201d the president continued.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat about the others?

Later in bed, Brown said, she thought Allen was reaching for his gun to shoot her, so she grabbed a handgun from her purse and shot him first.\n\nBrown then removed money from Allen\u2019s wallet, took his guns and drove his truck to a Walmart, the court documents said.\n\nBrown was tried as an adult, convicted of first-degree murder, felony murder and especially aggravated robbery and was sentenced to life in prison for Allen\u2019s death in 2006. She was also diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome in 2012.\n\nTennessee\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday said that, under the state\u2019s law, defendants like Brown who were convicted of first-degree murder after July 1, 1995, can only be released from prison after serving at least 51 years of their sentences.\n\nBrown has described her life sentence as a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d pointing to the 2012 Supreme Court ruling on mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles, according to court documents.\n\nBut a U.S. District Court in Tennessee denied Brown\u2019s motion, noting that she received a \u201clife sentence, not a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\u201d\n\nBrown has appealed that decision, which is pending before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nMarching for women means marching for #CyntoiaBrown. But the #WomensWave can do more than march, and we can do it NOW: Contact Gov. @BillHaslam and demand he pardon her.\n\n\n\nGov. Haslam has the power to #FreeCyntoia.

In recent years, celebrities, including Kim Kardashian West and Rihanna, have rallied in support of Brown and raising awareness around Brown as a victim of sex-trafficking.\n\nKardashian West has recruited her lawyers to help free Brown.

As they head into 2019 with a strengthened majority, they are positioned to do more of the same \u2015 and then some.\n\nRepublicans gained two Senate seats in November, giving them a 53-47 majority in the new year. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can now afford to lose a handful of GOP votes as he forges ahead with drastically reshaping the courts.\n\n\u201cWe intend to keep confirming as many as we possibly can for as long as we\u2019re in a position to do it,\u201d he told reporters after the November election. \u201cIt will still be my top priority in setting the agenda here in the Senate. In the next Congress as well.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have already put record numbers of Trump\u2019s judges onto the federal bench: 30 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices. That\u2019s so many circuit judges \u2015 more than any other president has seen confirmed by this point in his first term \u2015 that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.\n\nBut beyond the sheer numbers, there\u2019s an alarming theme in the caliber of Trump\u2019s court picks. Many are young and ideological with records of attacking abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights. Many were also recommended to Trump by the conservative Federalist Society.\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t do much to stop McConnell from confirming objectionable nominees; Republicans have been blowing up Senate traditions that previously gave the minority some leverage. And the reality is that even though Republicans have a slightly stronger hand now, all the GOP senators have been voting for Trump\u2019s court picks nearly all the time, meaning the vote outcomes in the new Senate likely won\u2019t change.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s increased margin opens the door to Trump putting forward even more extreme judicial nominees. And there\u2019s no reason to think Republicans would say no.\n\nSix of Trump\u2019s court picks earned a rare and abysmal \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating from the American Bar Association, and that didn\u2019t stop Republicans from confirming four of them. One of the \u201cnot qualified\u201d nominees was withdrawn, and another is still pending.\n\nAll but one Republican voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite him wailing through his confirmation hearing about revenge-minded Democrats besmirching him. In the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, amid dozens of judicial confirmation votes, there have been only two cases of GOP senators not supporting one of the president\u2019s court picks on the Senate floor: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the Kavanaugh vote and Sen. John Kennedy (La.) voted against Gregory Katsas.\n\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and judicial nominations expert, said this is an area of real concern in the coming Congress.\n\nRepublicans may try to \u201cnominate and confirm people who are even more conservative than the 30 circuit appointees,\u201d he said, \u201cand arguably less competent.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-decision-chuck-schumer_us_5c16602de4b05d7e5d82f100": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says Congress should hold a vote rejecting the rationale behind a federal judge\u2019s ruling on Friday striking down the entire Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight this tooth and nail. The first thing we\u2019re going to do when we get back to the Senate is put a vote on the floor urging an intervention in the case,\u201d Schumer said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor based his ruling on last year\u2019s Republican tax cut law, which repealed the tax penalty that enforced a mandate under Obamacare requiring that most Americans get health insurance. O\u2019Connor agreed with Republican officials in 20 states who brought the case by calling the mandate \u201cessential to and inseverable from\u201d the entire law.\n\n\u201cA lot of this depends on congressional intent. If a majority of the House and a majority of the Senate say that this case should be overturned, it\u2019ll have a tremendous effect on the appeal,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nSOPA Images via Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is urging Congress to say Friday's Affordable Care Act ruling should be overturned.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld Obamacare in 2012 and in 2015. Moreover, when Republicans crafted their tax cut legislation in December of 2017, few if any GOP lawmakers said it meant the end of the health care law altogether. In fact, Republicans just spent a majority of the 2018 midterm election cycle affirming their support for protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a supporter of Obamacare and its protections for pre-existing conditions, said Sunday she believes O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling will get overturned by a higher court.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the individual mandate can\u2019t be struck down and keep all the good provisions\u201d in the law, Collins said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201c\n\nIf O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling stands, it would deal a major blow to the U.S. health care system. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, eliminating the Affordable Care Act, which was passed in 2010, would increase the number of uninsured people by 50 percent with an additional 17 million people having no health coverage.\n\nThe Senate could pass a nonbinding resolution expressing the body\u2019s support for why the decision ought to be overturned, or simply clarifying its intent when it repealed Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. It is unlikely Republicans will allow such a vote, however, especially after President Donald Trump hailed the ruling as \u201cgreat news for America.\u201d\n\nAs I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster!

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, said Sunday in a separate interview on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nThe appeals process is expected to take some time, potentially as long as two years.

Those officials contended that the entire law should be stricken because Congress earlier this year repealed the fines known as \u201cshared responsibility payments\u201d that people without health coverage had to pay under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate. O\u2019Connor agreed.\n\n\u201cThe court finds the individual mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power and is still impermissible under the interstate commerce clause \u2015 meaning the individual mandate is unconstitutional\u2026. [T]he court finds the individual mandate is essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote in his opinion.\n\nIf the ruling stands, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance regulations would disappear and, along with them, the health coverage for millions of people who gained private insurance or Medicaid coverage under the 2010 law signed by President Barack Obama. Specifically, the law\u2019s guarantee of coverage for people regardless of their pre-existing conditions, financial assistance for private insurance, rules establishing a basic minimum set of benefits insurance policies must cover and more would vanish. Since O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling throws out the entire statute, the rest of the ACA, such as its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, also is stricken.\n\nIn short, this ruling would deal severe damage to the American health care system. It also would eradicate one of Obama\u2019s most significant accomplishments. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, eliminating the Affordable Care Act would increase the national uninsured rate by 50 percent and lead to more than 17 million people losing health coverage.\n\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the ruling in a pair of Twitter posts Friday night. \u201cAs I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions,\u201d he wrote in one post. In another Trump wrote, \u201cGreat news for America!\u201d\n\nAs I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling does not include a stay to delay it from taking effect, so the Affordable Care Act is now technically unconstitutional. The ruling will be appealed, however, making it unlikely that the law\u2019s health insurance markets, funding and regulations will immediately go away.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA for health care, and on America\u2019s faithful progress toward affordable health care for all Americans,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a news release. \u201cThe ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court. Today\u2019s misguided ruling will not deter us: Our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d Becerra led the team of Democratic state attorneys general who defended the Affordable Care Act in the case.\n\nRich Pedroncelli/ASSOCIATED PRESS California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said, \"Today\u2019s misguided ruling will not deter us: Our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question of constitutionality is straightforward: Is the individual mandate a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s enumerated powers when the shared-responsibility payment is zero?\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cBecause the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate under Congress\u2019s tax power, the Court will begin there before proceeding to an interstate commerce clause analysis. The court finds that both plain text and Supreme Court precedent dictate that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under either provision.\u201d\n\nLiberal and conservative legal scholars alike mostly dismissed the lawsuit, known as Texas v. Azar, as unserious and unsound, making O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling somewhat surprising. AARP, along with the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and other health care groups opposed the suit. So did a bipartisan group of nine governors.\n\nDuring oral arguments in September from the GOP officials, the U.S. Justice Department and lawyers for a group of Democratic officials from 16 states and the District of Columbia, O\u2019Connor appeared to side with the plaintiffs. President George W. Bush nominated O\u2019Connor to the court in 2007.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 case was based on an interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the individual mandate as constitutional in 2012 and the Obama administration\u2019s arguments that the policy shouldn\u2019t be struck down.\n\nObama\u2019s Justice Department maintained that the mandate went hand-in-hand with the rules protecting people with pre-existing conditions and the insurance subsidies the law provides, and that the mandate could not be eliminated without scrapping the entire law. Chief Justice John Roberts based his majority opinion on the case in part on this line of reasoning when he wrote that the mandate is constitutional as part of Congress\u2019 power to tax.\n\nCongress eliminated the individual mandate\u2019s penalties as part of the tax law President Donald Trump enacted earlier this year. Because there are no longer tax penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act and because the Obama administration argued the entire law must stand or fall on that basis, the GOP officials argued Roberts\u2019 ruling no longer protects the law.\n\nO\u2019Connor found this persuasive, which he appeared to indicate during oral arguments. He cited the Roberts ruling, the Obama administration\u2019s defense in the 2012 lawsuit and his interpretation of congressional intent when lawmakers passed the ACA in 2010 and when they repealed the mandate fines this year.\n\nThe Democratic state attorneys general defending the case argued, in effect, that congressional intent in 2010 doesn\u2019t matter because Congress revisited the issue in 2017, when it passed the tax bill eliminating the mandate penalties. Congress understood very well that it would affect the health care law \u2015 the issue was part of the debate \u2015 and decided to do so anyway, the attorneys general said.\n\nA wide variety of experts, including many critical of the Affordable Care Act in the past, found that line of argument persuasive. O\u2019Connor did not. He said that it was a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to consider what Congress did in 2017, because that was a debate about a tax bill, not the health care bill itself.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department refused to defend the law in court in defiance of the federal government\u2019s normal practice when a federal statute is challenged. Instead, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his department argued that the court should eliminate only the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that protect people with pre-existing conditions. The Justice Department also asked the judge to delay the effectiveness of the ruling until after the close of this year\u2019s open enrollment period on the health insurance exchanges, which ends Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration official who oversees the exchanges confirmed Friday night that the federal government will continue to enforce the Affordable Care Act while O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling is being appealed. \u201cThe recent federal court decision is still moving through the courts, and the exchanges are still open for business and we will continue with open enrollment. There is no impact to current coverage or coverage in a 2019 plan,\u201d Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote on Twitter.\n\nThree career Justice Department attorneys removed themselves from the case shortly before the department took this position. Days later, a veteran Justice lawyer actually resigned, although he did not specify that this case was the reason why.\n\nBecause the federal government declined to defend its own law, O\u2019Connor permitted Becerra and the other Democrats to argue on behalf of the Affordable Care Act instead. These officials emphasized that if Congress had wanted to repeal the entire law, it would have done so, but legislators merely did away with the mandate penalties.\n\nRepublican officials from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin filed the lawsuit.\n\nDemocratic officials from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia defended the law.\n\nJonathan Cohn contributed to this article.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-admin-seeks-quick-ruling-on-transgender-military-ban_us_5bf94c4de4b0eb6d930ebf43": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to issue an unusually quick ruling on the Pentagon\u2019s policy of restricting military service by transgender people. It\u2019s the fourth time in recent months the administration has sought to bypass lower courts that have blocked some of its more controversial proposals and push the high court, with a conservative majority, to weigh in quickly on a divisive issue.\n\nEarlier this month, the administration asked the high court to fast-track cases on the president\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields young immigrants from deportation. Administration officials also recently asked the high court to intervene to stop a trial in a climate change lawsuit and in a lawsuit over the administration\u2019s decision to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, is involved in three of the cases. Trump\u2019s recent salvo against the \u201cObama judge\u201d who ruled against his asylum policy \u2014 not one of the issues currently before the Supreme Court \u2014 prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to fire back at the president for the first time for feeding perceptions of a biased judiciary.\n\nJoshua Matz, publisher of the liberal Take Care blog, said the timing of the administration\u2019s effort to get the Supreme Court involved in the issues at an early stage could hardly be worse for Roberts and other justices who have sought to dispel perceptions that the court is merely a political institution, especially since the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At an especially sensitive moment for the Supreme Court, the Trump administration is \u201cforcing it into a minefield that many justices would almost surely prefer to avoid,\u201d Matz said.\n\nThe Supreme Court almost always waits to get involved in a case until both a trial and appeals court have ruled in it. Often, the justices wait until courts in different areas of the country have weighed in and come to different conclusions about the same legal question.\n\nSo it\u2019s rare for the justices to intervene early as the Trump administration has been pressing them to do. One famous past example is when the Nixon administration went to court to try to prohibit the publication of the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nIn the immigration case, the administration told the high court that it should step in and decide the fate of DACA ahead of an appeals court\u2019s ruling because the policy otherwise could be in place until the middle of 2020 before the justices might otherwise rule. The appeals court has since ruled, but the administration\u2019s request that the court hear the case stands.\n\nIn the military case, the administration argued that the Supreme Court should step in before an appeals court rules because the case \u201cinvolves an issue of imperative public importance: the authority of the U.S. military to determine who may serve in the Nation\u2019s armed forces.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Peter Renn, an attorney for Lambda Legal, which brought one of the challenges to the transgender military policy, called the Trump administration\u2019s action Friday a \u201chighly unusual step\u201d that is \u201cwildly premature and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military in 2016, under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. But the Trump administration revisited that policy, with Trump ultimately issuing an order banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under limited circumstances. Several lawsuits were filed over the administration\u2019s policy change, with lower courts all ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nStill ongoing in lower courts are the census and climate change cases. The Supreme Court for now has refused to block the climate change trial. In the census question case, the court has agreed to decide what kind of evidence a trial judge can consider and indefinitely put off questioning of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. But it rejected an administration request to delay the trial and allowed other depositions to take place.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politicians-react-trump-national-emergency_n_5c66e52fe4b01757c36b1b34": "Trump on Thursday said he would approve Congress\u2019 spending bill, which includes $1.375 billion for border barriers, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded. By declaring a national emergency, he can seize other government money to fund the project \u2014 about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, and an additional $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counterdrug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nWith that total of about $8 billion, the administration could erect some 234 miles of barriers, according to a senior administration official.\n\nIn reality, it will likely set up a legal battle that could tie up the president\u2019s signature promise for months or years to come.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s actions clearly violate the Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer wrote. \u201cThe Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-aclu-lawsuit_n_5c6341a2e4b03de942968362": "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two New Hampshire college students seeking to block a controversial new requirement for voters in the state, saying it imposes an unconstitutional \u201cpoll tax\u201d on voters and makes it disproportionately harder for students to cast a ballot.\n\nIn order to vote in New Hampshire, one needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there \u2015 meaning they have a continued physical presence in the state that they intend to maintain. Being \u201cdomiciled\u201d is legally different from being a \u201cresident.\u201d The state legally defines a resident as someone who intends to remain in the state \u201cfor the indefinite future.\u201d\n\nThe new measure, HB 1264, which is set to take effect on July 1, removes the phrase \u201cfor the indefinite future\u201d from the definition of resident and makes it identical to the definition of domiciled. Thus, anyone claiming to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in order to be eligible to vote is also saying they are a resident and is then obligated to required to get a driver\u2019s license and register their car within 60 days.\n\nThe ACLU says the change is unconstitutional because it imposes a needless and unnecessary burden on college students and others who don\u2019t plan to stay in the state permanently but want to vote there. The civil liberties group says the measure violates the First and 14th amendments because the state hasn\u2019t \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d the law to advance a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nThey also say it violates the 24th Amendment, which prohibits poll taxes, as well as the 26th Amendment, which grants the right to vote to anyone 18 or older.\n\nJulie Ebenstein, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project, noted New Hampshire lawmakers had been trying for decades to impose similar restrictions on college students\u2019 ability to vote. In 1972, a three-judge panel said a law that barred people who planned to leave a New Hampshire town at some point in the future from voting was unconstitutional. In 2014, a state court struck down a law that explicitly required anyone who registered to vote in New Hampshire to get a state driver\u2019s license and to get their vehicle registered there. That decision was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans passed HB 1264 shortly after Democrat Maggie Hassan defeated Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes for one of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seats in 2016. In the same year, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump in the state. Ebenstein noted the bill passed along party lines in the legislature and that lawmakers appeared to be targeting young voters and college students based on a perception that they supported Democrats.\n\n\u201cCollege students are perceived by legislators as being more liberal or being more left and we know that because the legislators said so. ... Given legislators\u2019 perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe 2016 election was very close in New Hampshire.\u201d She added that because of the state\u2019s small population the 13,000 undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire can make a difference in a close election.\n\nGiven legislators' perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted. Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney, ACLU Voting Rights Project\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, are Caroline Casey and Maggie Flaherty, two sophomores at Dartmouth College who are registered to vote in New Hampshire despite growing up outside the state. Both voted in the 2018 midterm elections there. Neither woman has a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and both intend to leave the state after graduating from college. Neither has a car and said in the complaint filed Wednesday that traveling to the nearest Division of Motor Vehicles would be a burden to them.\n\nIn a July op-ed justifying the law, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) wrote that people can vote in New Hampshire without satisfying the obligations of residents. The new law, he said, would put everyone on \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\nIn an advisory opinion last year, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found 3-2 that the new measure did not violate either the New Hampshire Constitution or the First or 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the law did not amount to a poll tax nor did it target young voters.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the State may legitimately establish procedures by which persons who may be tempted to insincerely claim domicile for voting purposes are discouraged from doing so by the prospect that such a claim can result in their incurring the full panoply of obligations imposed on all other state residents,\u201d the majority wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that states may not condition the right to vote on the payment of a tax or fee,\u201d they continued. \u201cHowever, the opponents of HB 1264 are mistaken when they claim that the bill conditions voting on the payment of motor vehicle fees or taxes. Rather, if a person becomes obligated to pay such fees or taxes, it will not be because the person votes, but because the person owns or drives a motor vehicle and is a resident of this state. Thus, a person who claims domicile in New Hampshire for voting purposes but who does not drive or own a motor vehicle will have no obligation to pay motor vehicle related fees.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images The ACLU is suing New Hampshire over a change in the legal definition of \"resident.\" The change is set to go into effect later this year.\n\nBut Ebenstein said the two students in the case had already shown they were legitimate New Hampshire voters. The state, she said, was essentially adding an additional hurdle for the students to prove they were bona fide residents.\n\n\u201cOur clients, who moved to New Hampshire, been active on campus, been active in their communities, who have already participated in the political process in New Hampshire are fully committed to their state and their role in the local community and certainly do to New Hampshire play a large role in the political conversation and process. That\u2019s most likely why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with ensuring someone\u2019s eligibility. It\u2019s just once they are eligible, the state can\u2019t put barriers in the way of letting them exercise that right,\u201d she added. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to prove their devotion to New Hampshire by paying fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sununu expressed confidence the law would be upheld:\n\nThis lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate attempt to dredge up arguments that our State Supreme Court already rejected last summer. The Supreme Court addressed each of the legal arguments made by opponents of House Bill 1264 and found that the law ensures that every voter is treated the same. I fully expect our federal court to reach the same conclusion. Given that House Bill 1264 does nothing more than align New Hampshire with virtually every other state in requiring residency in order to vote, the plaintiffs in this suit should be asked whether they plan to file identical lawsuits in every other state.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Sununu.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bad-lip-reading-donald-trump-state-of-the-union_us_5c62bd21e4b0ab4bc4e294be": "The video editing wizards put words into the three politicians\u2019 mouths with its latest spoof video, released online Tuesday.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, Sen.

In a fiery opinion issued Tuesday, Judge Carlton W. Reeves said the statute, described as one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, \u201cunequivocally\u201d violated women\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nReeves wrote of his \u201cfrustration\u201d that state lawmakers had chosen to pass the law despite the fact that similar legislation has been thrown out by federal courts in other states and that such litigation is very costly for taxpayers.\n\nHe contended the \u201creal reason\u201d for the ban\u2019s passage appeared to be the state\u2019s politically driven desire to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 law that assures a woman\u2019s constitutional right to access safe and legal abortions.\n\n\u201cThe state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Reeves wrote. \u201cThis court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi Legislature.\u201d\n\nThe law, which banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy except in cases of medical emergency or \u201csevere fetal abnormality,\u201d was passed in March. Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, filed a lawsuit challenging the ban on the same day, and Reeves put a temporary restraining order on the law the following morning.\n\nUnder Supreme Court precedent, states cannot restrict abortions before a fetus is considered viable. According to established medical consensus, viability typically begins at 23 to 24 weeks, Reeves noted in his opinion this week.\n\nThe judge acknowledged, however, that, \u201cwith the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court\u201d \u2015 an apparent reference to the additions of conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2015 the future of the nation\u2019s abortion laws has been cast into doubt.\n\n\u201cTime will tell. If overturning Roe is [Mississippi\u2019s] desired result, the state will have to seek that relief from a higher court. For now, the United States Supreme Court has spoken,\u201d Reeves wrote.\n\nMississippi abortion ban blocked by judge -\n\n\n\n\"The fact that men, myself included, are determining how women may choose to manage their reproductive health is a sad irony not lost on the court,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nYou should read the rest of his statement. https://t.co/eneUzO9Itw \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 21, 2018\n\nRogelio V.

Views about gender often diverge more sharply between Democrats and Republicans than between men and women. And included in that partisan divide, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, is a sharp disagreement between Republican and Democratic women over whether they feel a sense of kinship along gender lines at all.\n\nHalf of female Democrats say they share a lot of common interests and concerns with other women. Just 27 percent of female Republicans say the same. (Fewer than a quarter of men in either party say they share a lot of interests or concerns with other men.)\n\nThose results echo the fractured roles that partisanship and gender seemed to play in the polling about Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings. Many women who\u2019d voted for Hillary Clinton ascribed their anger and dismay at Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation to their experience of womanhood and expressed a sense of kinship with his accuser Christine Blasey Ford. Ford\u2019s experience \u201cis an amplified version of what every woman experiences throughout their entire lives,\u201d one Clinton voter we polled told us. Another, explaining why she identified with Ford, wrote simply, \u201cI\u2019m a woman.\u201d\n\nBut most women who had voted for President Donald Trump didn\u2019t feel a similar sense of female solidarity \u2015 just 5 percent said that they personally identified with Ford, with roughly eight times as many saying they felt more of a personal kinship with Kavanaugh. Gender, to them, mattered less than other facets of their social identity, like their politics or their religion. \u201cHe is a Christian man and a conservative,\u201d one female Trump voter noted. \u201cI am a Christian and conservative too.\u201d\n\nFemale Democrats and Republicans, political scientist Samara Klar wrote, \u201cdo not hold a common understanding of what it means to be a woman\u201d \u2015 meaning that, rather than stoking a bipartisan consensus around gender, talking about gender issues can actually exacerbate the mistrust between the women in the opposing party.\n\nIt\u2019s not just gender and political identities that interplay. About two-thirds of Protestant Republicans, for instance, say they share many common interests and concerns with others who hold the same religious beliefs; only 35 percent of Protestant Democrats say the same. Republicans who live in the South are more likely than those in the rest of the country to feel a kinship with those living near them, while Southern Democrats show no similar predilection. And Democrats in households making less than $50,000 a year are more likely than Republicans of similar means to say they share common interests with others who have about the same amount of money.\n\nComplicating everything further is the fact that many seemingly nonpolitical identities, including race, gender, religion and education, have, as The New York Times\u2019 Emily Badger and Quoctrung Bui recently wrote, \u201cincreasingly become intertwined with politics,\u201d leaving members of each party with fewer other identities in common. Women, as a whole, have edged toward the Democratic Party in recent years \u2015 which suggests one big reason that female Republicans might not be as likely to see other women as kindred spirits.\n\nAsked in the HuffPost/YouGov survey to choose the two groups with which they have the most in common, 22 percent of Americans said they felt closest to those in the same political party, with an equal number saying they felt the most kinship with others of the same age. Those were followed by those who felt closest to the people who live near them (16 percent), people of the same gender or the same religion (15 percent each), people of the same racial or ethnic background (12 percent) and people with similar amounts of money (11 percent). About a third said that none of the options applied, or that they weren\u2019t sure.\n\nThose results are a little different from a poll taken just before the 2016 election, when 30 percent of Americans chose party as the grouping with which they had the closest ties, and only 9 percent named gender. But, as the Times notes, \u201cidentities are complex, and they shift depending on the situation\u201d \u2015 meaning that the difference, theoretically, could mean that Americans care a little more about their parties when they\u2019re just about to vote in a presidential race.\n\nThe latest survey also asked respondents whether or not they thought they had much in common with each of the demographic groups mentioned.\n\nAmong the other findings:\n\n\u2015 A 52 percent majority of all Americans who identify with a political party, including half of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans, said they share a lot of common interests and concerns with others in their party.\n\n\u2015 Black Americans were split 38/34 as to whether or not they had much in common with others who share their race or ethnicity, while white Americans said, by 62 percent to 20 percent, that they did not.\n\n\u2015 Thirty percent of Americans younger than 30, and an equal percentage of those ages 30 to 44, said they have a lot in common with others their age. A third of those ages 45 to 64 and 35 percent of those older than 65 agreed.\n\n\u2015 Similar shares of people in households making less than $50,000 a year (31 percent) and between $50,000 and $100,000 a year (34 percent) said they share many common concerns with those in similar financial conditions. Just under a quarter of those making $100,000 or more annually said the same.\n\n\u2015 A 59 percent majority of Americans who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians said they share many interests and concerns with others of their faith. Half of all Protestants said the same, compared with just 29 percent of Catholics. Unsurprisingly, people who pray or attend a house of worship more frequently were more likely to feel a kinship with those who hold similar beliefs.\n\n\u2015 Just under a quarter of Northeasterners felt they had a lot in common with their neighbors, slightly below the 29-31 percent of the rest of the country that felt that way. There wasn\u2019t much difference on this metric between city-dwellers, suburbanites and those who live in more rural areas.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 4-6 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Forty-five percent said they supported getting the drugs in advance from a doctor for potential use down the road, 37 percent said they believed the drugs should be available over the counter and 30 percent said they supported making the pills available to women online.\n\nAnd when asked whether they\u2019d consider using any of those methods personally, nearly a quarter of the women said they\u2019d consider getting the pills in advance from a doctor or obtaining them over the counter, while 16 percent said they\u2019d be interested in buying the pills online.\n\n\u201cIf we consider that this is a representative sample of adult, reproductive-age women across the US \u2014 many of whom may not support abortion at all, may never have considered having an abortion themselves, or may never need an abortion \u2014 the proportion in favor of these models is extremely high,\u201d study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher, said in an email to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent.\u201d\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court put reproductive rights advocates on high alert about the future of Roe v. Wade, there has been a frenzy of activity around making self-induced abortion safer for women \u2014 particularly through increased access to the abortion pill.\n\nWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent. Antonia Biggs, study author\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in all 50 states in 1973, more than 1 million illegal abortions may have been performed in the United States each year \u2014 many of them deadly. American women went to Mexico to have surgical procedures, traveling alone in cars with strangers to see providers they knew nothing about. They used coat hangers and even drank bleach. The abortion pill has fundamentally changed the nature of so-called \u201cback alley\u201d abortions, but many reproductive rights advocates believe access is still far too limited.\n\nEarlier this fall, the founder of Women on Web \u2014 an organization that has long helped women outside of the United States perform their abortions at home \u2014 told The Atlantic she had been quietly shipping abortion pills to women in this country for more than six months through her new organization, Aid Access. Like Women on Web, it not only sells women the medications but also provides them with online consultations to walk them through the process.\n\nRight around that time, the Sia Legal Team \u2014 which works with women who have induced their own abortions \u2014 announced the launch of a free helpline for women who have been questioned by the police about ending their pregnancies (or who fear they might be), as well as a website with information about the legal landscape surrounding self-managed abortions. In some states, women have been prosecuted and jailed for attempting to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cBefore abortion was declared legal by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago, finding a safe abortion was really difficult,\u201d Jill Adams, SIA\u2019s strategy director, told HuffPost. \u201cBut now people who can get abortion pills have a safe option to end a pregnancy on their own. In this scenario, and in this age, the risk is legal; it\u2019s not physical. The image of the coat hanger has been supplanted by the image of handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThere is research backing the safety of largely self-managed abortions, although these studies have not necessarily examined the safety of women going it entirely alone. A 2017 investigation found, for example, that abortions are just as safe when managed remotely via telemedicine as they are when a clinician actually watches a woman take the first pill.\n\nWhat this all means for the future of self-managed abortions in the United States is uncertain.\n\nIn an email to HuffPost, the Food and Drug Administration said it \u201ctakes the allegations related to the sale of mifepristone in the U.S. through online distribution channels very seriously and is evaluating the allegations to assess potential violations of U.S. law.\u201d The FDA said it was unable to discuss potential or pending investigations, if any exist.\n\nA spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the organization does not have an official stance on Aid Access, though it has urged the FDA to remove certain restrictions on where a woman is able to access mifepristone, given the medication\u2019s track record of safety and efficacy. The group has also come out strongly against the criminalization of women who end their pregnancies.\n\nBut the new survey suggests that interest from women is there.\n\n\u201cWe really knew little about the demand for and interest in alternative models (advance provision, online access, and over-the-counter access) of medication abortion provision,\u201d said Biggs, a researcher at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWe would not expect these alternative models to meet the needs of all women,\u201d she added, \u201cbut do feel that by offering women more options, we are more likely to meet the needs of most women.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-quote-of-the-year-2018-fred-shapiro_us_5c10cbf8e4b0ac537179fdf5": "1. \u201cTruth isn\u2019t truth.\u201d \u2014 Rudy Giuliani.\n\n2. \u201cI liked beer.

Anderson was given credit for the 22 years he\u2019s already served.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely ready for this whole fiasco to be over with,\u201d Anderson told the Daily Commercial. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to my brothers and they tell me \u2026 at least you\u2019ll be able to come home.\u201d\n\nUntil Monday, Anderson was serving a sentence of life without parole for his part in the savage murders of 49-year-old Richard Wendorf and his wife, 54-year-old Ruth Wendorf.\n\nBecause he was 17 when the crimes were committed, Anderson became eligible for resentencing when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2016 that juveniles who had been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole were entitled to new sentencing hearings.\n\nWPSD-TV via ASSOCIATED PRESS This image from a Nov. 29, 1996, broadcast on WPSD-TV in Paducah, Kentucky, shows the teens arrested in connection with the slayings of Richard and Ruth Wendorf.\n\nIn 1996, Anderson was a member of the so-called Vampire Clan in the rural town of Murray, Kentucky. The group was led by Anderson\u2019s co-defendant, Rod Ferrell, who was 16 at the time of the slayings.\n\nRuth Wendorf\u2019s relatives attended Anderson\u2019s re-sentencing hearing and did not oppose his early release. Speaking with the Daily Commercial, they said they are more concerned about Ferrell, who will face his own re-sentencing hearing in July.\n\n\u201cWe just want Ferrell,\u201d said Ruth Wendorf\u2019s daughter, Paula Queen Lohse.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one we\u2019re waiting for,\u201d added her sister, Lillian Rapp. \u201cHe\u2019s very arrogant. He\u2019s never apologized.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Orlando Sentinel, Ferrell was the ringleader of the cult and was obsessed with the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade. At the time of his arrest, he claimed he was a 500-year-old vampire named Vesago\ufeff and told authorities his followers referred to him as \u201cmaker.\u201d Ferrell said the group participated in ritualistic ceremonies and bloodletting rituals.\n\n\u201cI tried to embrace the lifestyle of being a vampire and being so young, my mind latched onto it so deeply, so tenaciously, that I got lost inside it,\u201d Ferrell told Crime Watch Daily in April 2016.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections An undated photo of Rod Ferrell taken by the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nIn November 1996, Ferrell, Anderson and two girls, Charity Keesee, 16, and Dana Cooper, 19, traveled from western Kentucky to Eustis, Florida, about 35 miles northwest of Orlando, to pick up 15-year-old Heather Wendorf. Ferrell had met Wendorf a year earlier and wanted to induct her into his cult, police said.\n\nWhen the group arrived in Florida, they met with Wendorf, whom Ferrell later claimed was initiated into the cult by participating in \u201ccrossing over\u201d ceremony.\n\nFerrell and Anderson planned to break into Wendorf\u2019s parents\u2019 house and steal the keys to their 1993 Ford Explorer. However, the plan apparently changed along the way to include killing Richard and Ruth Wendorf. Ferrell and Anderson, police said, entered the Wendorf home alone on Nov. 25, 1996.\n\nRichard and Ruth Wendorf\u2019s other daughter, Jennifer, then 17, discovered the bodies later that night and called police.\n\nAl Gussler, then a detective with the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office, was the first officer on the scene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything worse,\u201d Gussler told Crime Watch Daily. \u201cIt was a very gruesome situation. That was probably the worst case I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nThe cult fled Florida in the Wendorfs\u2019 vehicle but didn\u2019t stay on the run long. On Thanksgiving Day 1996, they were picked up by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ferrell waived his Miranda rights and admitted killing the couple with a crowbar.\n\n\u201cI went to her dad and smacked the fuck out of him until he finally quit breathing, so, yes, I\u2019m admitting to murder,\u201d police said Ferrell told them. \u201cActually, it took him about 20 fucking minutes to stop. I swear, I thought he was immortal or something.\u201d\n\nFerrell told detectives he used a crowbar because a \u201cmachete or chainsaw\u201d would\u2019ve been \u201ctoo messy.\u201d\n\nRuth Wendorf, the self-proclaimed cult leader explained, walked out of a bathroom after her husband was killed and saw him holding the bloody murder weapon. She was holding a hot cup of coffee and threw the liquid in Ferrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when she lunged at me, \u2019cause I was actually going to let her live, but after she lunged at me, I just took the bottom of the crowbar and kept stabbing it through her skull,\u201d Ferrell said.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections An undated photo of Charity Keesee that was taken by the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nAnderson also spoke with police. He admitted being at the crime scene and suggested the homicides had been premeditated.\n\n\u201cI was going to go for the father, and he was going to go for the mother, but when I saw him make the first blow, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nWhen details of the horrific murders were made public, the media dubbed them the Vampire Cult Killings. The nickname was widely reported, much to the consternation of the defense attorneys, who failed to persuade reporters to refer to it as \u201cthe Wendorf case,\u201d the Orlando Sentinel reported.\n\nA grand jury in Lake County indicted Ferrell, Anderson, Keesee and Cooper in December 1996. The grand jury declined to indict Heather Wendorf.\n\nIn February 1998, Ferrell, then 17, pleaded guilty to two counts of felony murder and was sentenced to death. At the time, he was the youngest person on death row in the United States.\n\nAnderson was given his life sentence after pleading guilty to being a principal to first-degree murder.\n\nKeesee was convicted of two counts of third-degree murder and sentenced to 10 years behind bars. Cooper, who was convicted of the same charges, received a 17-year sentence. Both women have since been released.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections An undated photo of Dana Cooper that was taken by the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nFerrell remained on death row until 2000, when the Florida Supreme Court reduced his sentence to life in prison.\n\nDuring his interview with Crime Watch Daily, Ferrell said he expects his sentence will be commuted to either time served or a specific number of years.\n\n\u201cI have a woman [and] I have a job waiting on me,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cI even have a cat and dog waiting.\u201d\n\nThe Florida State Attorney\u2019s Office \u2015 the agency representing the state in the resentencing hearings \u2015 did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nRetired detective Gussler said he does not believe Ferrell should ever be released.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give a second chance to the brutal murder of the mother and father, so, no, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he could stay there for life,\u201d Gussler told Crime Watch Daily. \u201cAnd if I lived in the area he was getting out in, I would definitely keep an eye out on him.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kerry-washington-kavanaugh-donald-trump_us_5bd8320ee4b017e5bfd59123": "\u201cBut rather than just be upset, we have to do what democracy does, we have to show up and vote, and we have to make sure that we make the decisions about who is running our country and our states and our cities and our neighborhoods.

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had a blunt assessment after President Donald Trump doubled down on his threat to declare a national emergency in order to build his border wall: Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the power.\u201d\n\nBefore leaving for Camp David on Sunday, the president told reporters that he was considering using emergency powers to build a wall on the southern border, the funding for which Congress has refused to provide. The government has been partially shut down over this impasse.\n\nSchiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that not only is that rhetoric \u201creally threatening,\u201d but suggested that the president can\u2019t even do that.\n\n\u201cIf Harry Truman couldn\u2019t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn\u2019t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,\u201d Schiff said on Tapper\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cSo that\u2019s a nonstarter.\u201d\n\nTruman had cited a national emergency during the Korean War to take control of the steel industry in 1952, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his executive order.\n\nTrump\u2019s government shutdown has hinged on his demand for more than $5 billion in wall funding, but neither the president nor the newly empowered Democrats in the House of Representatives seem to be budging.\n\nTrump first floated the national emergency idea during a press conference Friday, but whether he can actually do so is a gray area, legal experts told NBC News.\n\n\u201cHe can declare some kind of national emergency, but what it would allow him to do legally is a totally different question,\u201d George Washington University professor and presidential power expert Matt Dallek told the outlet.\n\nHarvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet told NBC that Trump may actually be able to get his wall by turning to certain unused Defense Department funds that Congress doles out yearly with no specific intention.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is to say that if he declares a national emergency and uses this pot of unappropriated money for the wall, he\u2019s on very solid legal ground,\u201d Tushnet said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/appeals-court-orders-ohio-to-count-purged-voters-ballots_us_5bdadb7ce4b019a7ab5a7c6e": "A federal appeals court in Ohio issued an emergency ruling allowing provisional ballots cast by people purged from voter rolls to be counted in next week\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nIn a decision likely affecting thousands of voters, a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel determined that those purged from the rolls between 2011 and 2015 will be eligible to vote as long as they live in the same county where they were last registered. Anyone who re-registered before Oct. 9 should be able to vote with a regular ballot, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the plaintiffs.\n\nOhio\u2019s secretary of state, Jon Husted, said he won\u2019t appeal the ruling to avoid \u201can unnecessary source of contention\u201d days before the election.\n\nOhio removes voter registrations for people who don\u2019t vote for several consecutive years and fail to notify the state of an address change.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) offered a defense against the recent reports that she has consistently mistreated members of her staff.\n\n\u201cYes, I can be tough, and yes I can push people,\u201d Klobuchar told reporters following her rally at Minneapolis\u2019 Boom Island Park. \u201cI have high expectations for myself, I have high expectations for the people that work for me, but I have high expectations for this country.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIn the end, there are so many great stories of our staff that have been with me for years.\u201d\n\nAccounts from several of her former employees that surfaced in recent days describe a long history of Klobuchar constantly berating her staff and creating a hostile work environment. At least three people have withdrawn from consideration to lead her 2020 campaign, in part because of her behavior as a boss, HuffPost reported on Wednesday.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her presidential candidacy on Sunday at a snowy rally in Minneapolis. Afterward, she spoke to reporters about reports that she routinely disparages many of the people who work for her.\n\nIn interviews with HuffPost and BuzzFeed, former staffers said Klobuchar regularly chastised and shouted at her employees over minor errors, berated them in late-night emails and sometimes threw objects, leaving some workers often in tears. Others said she would task them with her personal errands, such as washing dishes at her home, which violates Senate ethics rules.\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s mistreatment of staff caused then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to privately reprimand her in 2015, HuffPost reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nReid does not recall if this encounter occurred, a spokesperson said. Now retired, Reid described Klobuchar as \u201cone of the most brilliant, hardest-working members of the Senate.\u201d\n\nAn outspoken critic of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Klobuchar made national headlines last year with her tough questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearing. She has maintained high approval ratings in her home state, where she is known for being warm and personable, and she easily won a third term in November.\n\nShe joins an already crowded field seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination that includes several women \u2015 Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).\n\nThe rumor around here is that working for her is hell. Bruce Olson, Minneapolis resident\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s supporters and some of her former staff members believe much of the criticism of the lawmaker\u2019s managerial style stems from sexism.\n\n\u201cFemale politicians get treated very differently than male politicians in matters like this,\u201d said Tom Reimann, 26, who attended Sunday\u2019s rally with his fianc\u00e9e. \u201cIf men are seen as aggressive, and kind of domineering, it\u2019s seen as a positive trait, like they\u2019re just trying to get things done. When women do the same thing, there are a number of negative stereotypes.\u201d\n\nStill, Klobuchar has been plagued by one of the highest staff turnover rates in the Senate. When she first ran for the Senate in 2006, her aides wrote a memo outlining duties for the staffer in charge of her personal needs and logistics. \u201c... DON\u2019T interupt [sic] her unless ABSOLUTELY necessary and be careful when trying to calm her down,\u201d it warned.\n\nDuring her 2006 campaign, Klobuchar was serving as the Hennepin County attorney, and the president of the union representing many of her employees claimed she had \u201ccreated a hostile work environment\u201d and \u201cseverely damaged the morale of the office.\u201d At the time, Klobuchar and her staff said that characterization was part of a broader backlash over salary negotiations.\n\nThe surfacing of more details of Klobuchar\u2019s employee mistreatment raises questions about how it will affect her ability to campaign with the \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d reputation she has long enjoyed.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-iowa-caucus-democrats-love-progressive-patriotism_us_5c6056f2e4b0f9e1b17e458b": "WATERLOO, Iowa \u2015 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s favorite presidential campaign-trail yarn \u2015 and he has a lot of them \u2015 is about how his parents, two of IBM\u2019s first black executives, overcame housing market discrimination to raise him and his brother in a predominantly white neighborhood in one of his state\u2019s suburbs.\n\n\n\nAs an adult, Booker likes to recall, he asked Arthur Lessman, the white lawyer who helped his parents outsmart a racist real estate agent, why the attorney was inspired to do it. It turned out that Lessman had volunteered his services after watching television one day in 1965 when the normal programming was interrupted by breaking footage of Alabama state troopers brutally bludgeoning black civil rights activists marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.\n\n\n\nRecounting the tale Friday afternoon to an audience of about 100 Democrats at a community college in Waterloo, Booker marveled at the far-reaching power of individual political sacrifices. It\u2019s a testament, he declared with excitement in his voice, to his deeply held belief that \u201clove is a radical force.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe marchers in Selma \u201cstood up for love of country and unleashed that energy and it instantaneously leapt a thousand miles and changed the heart of one man on a couch in New Jersey, who then would go on and change generations not yet born,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here right now because of that chain reaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same weekend that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to \u201cfight back\u201d against the \u201cclass warfare\u201d waged by the super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort.\n\n\n\nRather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy \u2015 an \u201cus\u201d against a proverbial \u201cthem\u201d \u2015 Booker focuses almost entirely on the \u201cus\u201d \u2015 on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement.\n\n\n\nBooker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States\u2019 forefathers \u201cimperfect geniuses\u201d for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not.\n\nI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it. Tom Swartz, former Iowa state representative, referring to Booker\n\nIn this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman\u2019s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism.\n\n\u201cIf we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,\u201d he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Booker\u2019s appeals to America\u2019s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders\u2019 work of forming a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama\u2019s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job.\n\nOn Booker\u2019s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it,\u201d said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown.\n\nAfter the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren\u2019s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.)\n\nBut Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump\u2019s invective.\n\n\u201cIt probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,\u201d Blaisdell said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Charlie Neibergall Booker minged with voters at the First Congregational United Church of Christ on Friday in Mason City, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I Had To Run Something\u2019\n\nBooker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders \u2015 which includes several of his Senate colleagues. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have announced their candidacies; Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs.\n\nBooker, whose mother\u2019s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party\u2019s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cMy story is your story,\u201d he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class.\n\nBooker tells story of his Iowa roots. His ancestors moved from Alabama to mining town of Buxton; grandmother grew up in Des Moines. pic.twitter.com/lnrwamvd3V \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nMany of the Iowans who came to hear Booker speak knew him already from his dramatic, televised confrontations with Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s confirmation hearings last year.\n\nHe burnished his credentials among many Democrats when he released a memo Kavanaugh had written on racial profiling after the Republican-controlled committee refused to publicize it and barred Booker from questioning the nominee about it. On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a \u201cSpartacus moment,\u201d a reference that left observers quizzical.\n\nRegardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI had to run something,\u201d Booker said in Marshalltown. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nThe experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate.\n\nBooker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing.\n\nGrassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country\u2019s system of law enforcement and incarceration.\n\nRather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\u201cSome people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. \u201cWell, I ran a fire department. That\u2019s not going to be a constructive strategy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Susan Walsh Booker cajoles Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to join him in an Instagram Live post in December. Looking on is Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nShrugging Off Criticism From The Left\n\nOf course, Booker\u2019s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term \u201cWall Street\u201d \u2015 a favorite target of attack among his party\u2019s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.)\n\nIn his efforts to improve Newark\u2019s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good.\n\nBooker\u2019s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies.\n\nIn addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago.\n\nBooker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations.\n\nIn Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools.\n\nTime and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities.\n\nRather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor.\n\n\u201cI was like Malcolm X \u2014 by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,\u201d he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening.\n\nAt the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren.\n\nHe admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high.

So some are turning to a new strategy to keep the court from damaging their policy priorities: presenting arguments to its conservative justices in a language they understand.\n\nFor this court, that means making textualist arguments \u2015 grounding a legal case in the original text of the Constitution and any relevant statutes \u2015 to peel at least one vote from its five-vote conservative bloc. One progressive group happens to be uniquely prepared for this moment.\n\nThe Constitutional Accountability Center, founded in 2008 by litigator Doug Kendall, is the central hub for advancing progressive textualist arguments in the courts and to the public. Kendall, who died in 2015, argued that the debate over how judges should interpret the law was over: Textualism, which had largely been embraced by conservatives like the late Justice Antonin Scalia, had won. It was time for progressives to join the fight over the meaning and interpretation of the Constitution, Kendall said.\n\n\u201cOur founding belief was that if progressives spent less time fighting about the method of interpreting the Constitution with conservatives, we could spend more time discussing what the Constitution actually means,\u201d said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel for CAC. \u201cAnd that that\u2019s a fight that progressives can win.\u201d\n\nThe textual arguments the center has been making for a decade are now more important than ever. Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s departure from the court in 2018 left behind a conservative court majority that takes after Scalia far more than Kennedy.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images The new Supreme Court is further to the right than any court in the decades.\n\n\u201cWith the different court, mostly populated by people who have fashioned themselves as originalists, you know, we need to speak to them in the language that they have at least themselves,\u201d Gorod said.\n\nThe center\u2019s lawyers are representing nearly 200 members of Congress suing President Donald Trump for violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. They argued against the appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. And they have made textual arguments through amicus briefs in dozens of cases that have been decided, argued or are still working their way through the courts, including on vital issues like the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the federal housing agencies.\n\nThe Supreme Court may have kept Whitaker in his position when it ruled on a separate challenge to his appointment, but other textual arguments CAC has made have succeeded in reaching progressive results.\n\nIn the case of New Prime v. Oliveira, the court issued a unanimous 8-0 decision written by Justice Neil Gorsuch that sided with Dominic Oliveira, a trucker, against New Prime, his employer, which sought to use forced arbitration to get him to pay for his own gas and leasing his truck. This was a remarkable win for workers, as the conservative bloc on the court has sided with the corporations in practically every recent case involving forced arbitration.\n\nHow did this conservative court come to this rare conclusion in support of an independent contractor? It\u2019s because CAC and Public Justice, the group representing Oliveira, made detailed textual arguments to the court \u2015 and won.\n\nThe costs that led to the forced arbitration in the case arose because New Prime classified Oliveira as an independent contractor during his apprenticeship period. This let New Prime deduct costs from his paycheck. Oliveira challenged whether New Prime could classify him as an independent contractor at all; if not, the company could not force him into an unfair arbitration process.\n\nPublic Justice and CAC argued in briefs and to the court that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, as it was originally written and understood, would not allow New Prime to classify Oliveira as an independent contractor. To make this argument they dug deep into dictionaries from the Middle Ages up to the 1920s to show that lawmakers who wrote and passed the FAA in 1925 saw the word \u201cemployment\u201d as a synonym for \u201cwork.\u201d Therefore if Oliveira was working for New Prime in any capacity, he should technically be treated as an employee for the purposes of the arbitration law.\n\nIn his decision, Gorsuch cited the dictionaries Public Justice and CAC presented as evidence to side with Oliveira and deliver a progressive victory for workers.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Justice Neil Gorsuch is the main target of progressive textualist arguments.\n\n\u201cWhat New Prime illustrated was that progressives can achieve victory by really making the arguments in the way that are going to resonate with a Justice Gorsuch, a Justice [Clarence] Thomas, who wants to really focus on the text rather than simply making policy arguments,\u201d Gorod said.\n\nThese progressive textualist arguments are what Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern labeled the \u201cGorsuch brief.\u201d As the court\u2019s most dedicated textualist, Gorsuch has become a favored target of progressive briefs grounded in text-based arguments. New Prime wasn\u2019t the only case where progressives succeeded by tailoring their arguments to Gorsuch.\n\nAs Stern notes, Gorsuch appeared receptive to progressives\u2019 arguments in the 2018 Nielsen v. Preap case that could decide when the government can detain undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime. The ACLU, representing Mony Preap and other respondents, argued that the text of the law in question said these immigrants can only be put in detention \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d from criminal custody. The Trump administration said they could detain the immigrants at any time after release.\n\n\u201cIn some sense, Supreme Court litigation is about arguing to targets and about who one sees as the swing votes potentially,\u201d said Praveen Fernandes, CAC\u2019s vice president for outreach.\n\nCAC hopes its textual arguments, in cases still moving through the courts, will be compelling enough if they reach the Supreme Court. They have already been successful in a lower court with their arguments in the emoluments case against Trump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good example of a legal question that wasn\u2019t something that anyone was thinking about a couple of years ago,\u201d Gorod said. \u201cBut we looked to the Constitution\u2019s text and its history and what the framers were trying to accomplish when they included the foreign emoluments clause in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe district court judge overseeing the case agreed with CAC\u2019s arguments that the definition of emoluments includes business transactions like a rented hotel room or a government gifting the president with a trademark and that the Constitution\u2019s authors intended for the clause to apply to the president. It was a major win for a landmark case that is almost certain to be heard by the Supreme Court.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-conway-trump-birthright-citizenship_us_5bd9025be4b019a7ab583388": "\u201cSometimes the Constitution\u2019s text is plain as day and bars what politicians seek to do,\u201d Conway wrote with fellow attorney Neal Katyal in The Washington Post. \u201cSuch a move would be unconstitutional and would certainly be challenged.

The paper said the woman reached out prior to Fairfax\u2019s inauguration in 2018 and that it hadn\u2019t been able to corroborate either Fairfax\u2019s or the woman\u2019s account.\n\nColleagues of Tyson\u2019s at Stanford University, at which she is a research fellow, also said she told them about the alleged incident last year, prior to the scandal surrounding Northam.\n\nTyson has retained law firm Katz, Marshall and Banks, which also represented Christine Blasey Ford when she accused then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school. (Kavanaugh was eventually confirmed by the Senate.)\n\nFord, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in Northern California, also faced scrutiny and claims that her allegation was politically motivated.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-filibuster-nuclear_us_5c5a286de4b00187b5560591": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Many Democrats say they oppose changing Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on legislation, otherwise known as the filibuster, despite some calls from the left urging them to do so to more easily advance their agenda in 2021.\n\nAmbitious Democratic proposals like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d or the Green New Deal stand little chance of becoming law in the near future given near-unanimous Republican opposition and the Senate\u2019s long-standing supermajority requirement. Even if Democrats manage to claw back to power in the Senate and recapture the White House in 2020, the GOP would likely prevent them from advancing to a final vote by using the filibuster.\n\nThat\u2019s why some on the left are pushing Democrats to either be honest with voters about the chances of passing major legislation they\u2019ve introduced or simply rip the Band-Aid off and ditch a rule that doesn\u2019t actually appear in the Constitution anyway.\n\n\u201cThe Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. [Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell] will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything. If Dems win the WH & Senate in 2020, they should nuke the 60-vote threshold on day one and get on with it,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for ex-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said last month.\n\nOther progressives like Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice have argued that Democrats stand to benefit more from eliminating the filibuster because Republicans are generally less likely to propose sweeping changes in domestic policy due to their conservative ideology.\n\nBut nearly a dozen Democrats rejected those arguments in interviews on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, calling the filibuster a critical tool that helps foster bipartisanship, as well as a means of guarding against political passions that can bubble up in the House and the executive branch. Many of those Democratic senators also expressed concern about a scenario in which Republicans once again controlled both Congress and the White House.\n\nIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)\n\n\u201cIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive to the nation. So while I understand the frustration ... I think the consequences of getting rid of it are too great,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday.\n\nIndeed, if the filibuster had not been on the books during the first two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans could have passed a whole host of legislation Democrats most likely would not liked to have seen become law \u2015 including, possibly, funding for his border wall.\n\n\u201cWhat you might think today would be in your favor, might not be in your favor tomorrow,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who was just elected to a six-year term, added on Tuesday.\n\nSome Democrats still harbor regrets over the decision in 2013 to unilaterally end the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. Democratic leaders said at the time they were forced to take the step to confirm a number of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees given unprecedented GOP obstruction from people like McConnell. Reid, who pulled the trigger on the rule change, still maintains that it was the right thing to do. But now that Republicans are confirming young, conservative judicial nominees at a historic pace under the Trump administration, some Democrats say there is reason for caution about going even further.\n\n\u201cI would remind people there was a lot of interest in getting rid of the filibuster for judges and for the Supreme Court, and that has not served us well,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked whether she supported eliminating the filibuster on legislation.\n\nMany 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls also share concerns about going nuclear to kill the filibuster. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the most recent entry in the field, said last week he would \u201cpersonally resist efforts to get rid of it.\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said last month she would consider ending the filibuster. In the meantime, the presidential candidate said that lacking 60 votes \u201cmeans you haven\u2019t done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a potential White House contender, has endorsed several progressive proposals on health care and climate change. He has also recently introduced legislation that would drastically expand the estate tax on the wealthy, a proposal he says would would raise $2.2 trillion. But the senator declined to address how to go about getting such proposals passed into law on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit speculative. I need to worry about what\u2019s happening in the country right now. That\u2019s a little bit into the future,\u201d Sanders said when asked whether he supported killing the filibuster.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, was the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who did not rule out the prospect of going nuclear in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cEverything stays on the table. You keep it all on the table. Don\u2019t take anything off the table,\u201d Warren said in an interview with Politico last week.\n\nThe debate over the filibuster is likely to heat up in the Democratic primary over the next two years with many progressives in the race floating a wish list of progressive proposals on everything from health care and taxes, to voting rights and climate change. But some Democrats think the conversation isn\u2019t exactly productive for the party when it comes to running Washington.\n\n\u201cSome of us have to think about governing. ... In terms of nuts and bolts, in terms of making this place work better, I don\u2019t think that talk is helpful,\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting he was not running for president.\n\nThe likelihood of ending the 60-vote threshold on legislation is extremely small in the near future due to bipartisan opposition. Trump repeatedly pushed McConnell to kill the filibuster last year in order to build the wall, for example. The Kentucky senator has resisted the president\u2019s entreaties, estimating in an interview last year that two-thirds of his caucus oppose doing so.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster, which has been around for a long time, is a problem. And it does, I think, generate on many occasions kind of a bipartisan solution, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always bad for the country,\u201d McConnell said in the interview.\n\nStill, progressives don\u2019t view the threat of a filibuster as an impediment to proceeding with legislation like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In fact, they argue that building political support for big new ideas often takes time, and the traditional place where that has occurred in the past is in the lower chamber.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tim-scott-opposes-thomas-farrs-judgeship_us_5c530da6e4b093663f5c0b70": "Sen.

Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).\n\nDespite the political embarrassment of thwarted nomination, Farr\u2019s backers want President Donald Trump to again submit his name for Senate confirmation to the judgeship in the new session of Congress. And in a letter to Scott earlier this week, 31 conservative leaders urged him to reverse himself, given that his stance on Farr could prove crucial to whether Trump follows through with a renomination.\n\n\u201cIn these difficult days, when allegations of racism are carelessly, and all too often deliberately, thrown about without foundation, the result is not racial healing, but greater racial polarization,\u201d they wrote in the letter obtained by the McClatchy News Service. \u201cJoining with those who taunt every political opponent a \u2018racist\u2019 as a partisan political tactic to destroy their reputations is not helpful to the cause of reconciliation.\u201d\n\nThose signing the letter include Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife, Ginni Thomas, former Attorney General Edwin Meese, who served under President Ronald Reagan, and an array of North Carolina GOP leaders.\n\nScott met with Farr on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, but did not change his mind, McClatchy reported. And he offered a fiery response to the news outlet to the letter from the conservatives. From the story:\n\n\u201cWhy they have chosen to expend so much energy on this particular nomination I do not know, but what I do know is they have not spent anywhere near as much time on true racial reconciliation efforts, decrying comments by those like (Republican U.S. Rep.) Steve King, or working to move our party together towards a stronger, more unified future,\u201d Scott continued, referring to the Iowa congressman who recently suggested he was sympathetic to white supremacists in a New York Times interview.\n\nScott, noting that he supports Republican judicial nominees the vast majority of the time, also said that \u201cfor some reason the authors of this letter choose to ignore ... facts.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-money_us_5c59d656e4b00187b5558da0": "Sen.

Under President Barack Obama, the EPA determined the existing standards for limiting smog-forming ozone pollution fell short and needed to be toughened.\n\nLast June, the EPA proposed a rule reversing that determination, a move undercutting more aggressive enforcement of the Clean Air Act. The EPA finalized the rule last month.\n\nOn Thursday, newly elected New York Attorney General Letitia James cried foul, filing a lawsuit arguing the EPA is violating the Clean Air Act by \u201cfailing to require any further control of power plants and other sources of smog pollution in states upwind\u201d of her state.\n\nThe attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey joined the suit, as did New York City.\n\n\u201cOver two-thirds of New Yorkers regularly breathe unhealthy air due to smog pollution,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cYet, the Trump EPA is ignoring the Clean Air Act and refusing to require reductions in the pollution largely responsible for this serious public health risk \u2015 pollution that blows into New York from upwind states.\u201d\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS New York Attorney General Letitia James led five other states in suing the Trump EPA over enforcement of the Clean Air Act.\n\nAt the heart of the lawsuit is a 2015 determination during the Obama administration that found air pollution rules in 24 states failed to \u201csufficiently and collectively\u201d reduce pollution emissions and threatened states like New York, which has some of the country\u2019s strictest clean air regulations.\n\nThose states targeted in 2015 included Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia \u2015 all upwind of New York.\n\nThe suit filed Thursday in the U.S. Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit argues that the EPA\u2019s 2018 revised determination is \u201cunlawful, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d The suit asks the court to vacate the rule.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the Trump administration is relying on technically flawed and incomplete analysis to disregard its obligations under the Clean Air Act,\u201d said David Hayes, executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center, which works with state attorneys general. \u201cThis coalition of attorneys general have actively opposed this administration\u2019s repeated attempts to shirk its legal responsibility to protect the public from dangerous levels of ozone pollution, and they are standing on very firm legal ground in this case.\u201d\n\nThe suit marks James\u2019 first major environmental challenge to the White House since she took office this month. Democratic attorneys general, who now control a majority of states\u2019 top law enforcement jobs, have become a major bulwark against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to delay or roll back nearly 80 environmental regulations. Earlier on Thursday, 15 state attorneys general filed a petition with the EPA requesting new restrictions on asbestos. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has sued the White House over environmental regulations at least two dozen times.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy borrowed from their Republican counterparts.

Justin Fairfax (D) vehemently denied a sexual assault allegation against him that resurfaced late Sunday, arguing it was timed to derail his potential ascent to the governorship.\n\n\u201cThis allegation is completely false,\u201d Fairfax said at an impromptu press conference in the Capitol rotunda on Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be 40 years old next month.

When pressed for evidence of her subsequent communication, Fairfax said he did not have any because it had happened over the phone.\n\nFairfax has become the subject of national attention in recent days as pressure mounts on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to resign. Virtually every Democratic elected official in the state has withdrawn support for Northam after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page emerged Friday. Northam initially said he appeared in the photo, which shows a man in blackface standing with another man in a Ku Klux Klan uniform, but he subsequently recanted. At a Saturday press conference, Northam nonetheless admitted to another instance of wearing blackface.\n\nFairfax, the second black statewide elected official in Virginia\u2019s history, would succeed Northam if the governor resigned. (Fairfax has not called on Northam to resign; he declined to do so again at Monday\u2019s press conference.)\n\nThe chaos escalated Sunday night as the specter of scandal spread to Fairfax as well.\n\nBig League Politics, the same conservative news site that first published Northam\u2019s yearbook photo, published a screenshot of a social media post by a woman describing her sexual assault accusation against Fairfax.\n\n\u201cImagine you were sexually assaulted during the [Democratic National Convention] in Boston in 2004 by a campaign staffer.

The woman alleged that Fairfax then forced her to perform oral sex through physical coercion, according to the Post.\n\nThe Post did not publish the story in November 2017 because it \u201ccould not find anyone who could corroborate either version,\u201d and it found no evidence of similar allegations after interviewing several people who knew Fairfax in college, law school and during his political career.\n\nFairfax and his staff are sticking by their story, and are accusing the Post of acting without journalistic integrity given its professed inability to corroborate the story.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official,\u201d Burke said in a statement. \u201cWe ask further: What other major elected official in the Commonwealth of Virginia would be smeared with sexual allegations that were presented without corroboration?\u201d\n\nI asked LG Fairfax's team what they make of the Post denying there were \"red flags\" with allegation story.\n\n\n\n\"The Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official.\" Full statement from staff is attached. pic.twitter.com/5rMtlcAenh \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 4, 2019\n\nWhen asked Monday whether he would welcome his accuser to share her story with the legislature, Fairfax did not explicitly reject the idea.\n\n\u201cAnyone is free to speak up and be heard,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a party, Democrats have declared their intolerance of sexual misconduct of any kind.\n\nThey mobilized en masse in an attempt to keep then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the high court after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her at a party in high school.

We will continue to evaluate the situation regarding Lieutenant Governor Fairfax.\" pic.twitter.com/ae39YSXi69 \u2014 Virginia Democrats (@vademocrats) February 5, 2019\n\nLater in the day, the House and Senate Democratic caucuses released a joint statement with a comparable message.\n\n\u201cThe facts here are still being determined,\u201d the caucuses said. \u201cEvery individual deserves the opportunity to be heard, and we respect anyone who comes forward to share their story.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the claim against Fairfax has indeed complicated the way lawmakers and media outlets discuss the allegation.\n\nOn Sunday night, a far-right website, Big League Politics, published a screenshot of a social media post in which the accuser lamented that Fairfax, who she said had assaulted her, was now poised to ascend to the highest post in the state. It is not clear that the accuser wanted the post to be publicized.\n\nFairfax\u2019s staff subsequently denied the accusation, arguing that The Washington Post had already been alerted to the claim but found \u201csignificant red flags and inconsistencies\u201d in the accuser\u2019s story. His team threatened to take legal action \u201cagainst those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation.\u201d\n\nThe Post responded by publishing its own version of events in which it acknowledged that it had looked into the claim in November 2017 and revealed that the accuser alleged that Fairfax had physically coerced her into performing oral sex in 2004. The newspaper declined to publish the story because it felt it could not corroborate the charge, but it also denied finding \u201cred flags.\u201d\n\nFairfax\u2019s accuser has now hired the same law firm that represented Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nState Democrats are waiting for Fairfax\u2019s accuser to speak publicly about the incident, according to a Democratic activist familiar with their thinking.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) gave a similar explanation for his reticence in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. \u201cEvery person who has a claim that they have been sexually assaulted deserves to tell their own story in their time and that\u2019s not yet happened,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) offered a more laconic comment, referring HuffPost back to Fairfax\u2019s public denial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make no further comment than referring you back to the lieutenant governor\u2019s statement,\u201d Warner tells me when asked about the sexual harassment allegation against Fairfax \u2014 Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) February 5, 2019\n\nBut the Fairfax accusation comes mere months after national Democrats demanded a Senate hearing for Blasey Ford, the accuser of then-Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh.\n\nTo be sure, Blasey Ford had already agreed to reveal her identity when Democrats called for her to testify. It is not yet clear if Fairfax\u2019s accuser wants to do the same, even though Big League Politics chose to publish her name.\n\nBusy with bills and focused on matters at hand right now. Eileen Filler-Corn, Virginia's House Democratic leader, when asked about the Justin Fairfax allegation\n\nStill, it is notable that so far there is no push by Virginia Democrats to provide a forum for Fairfax\u2019s accuser or to encourage her to come forward in the interest of shedding light on the matter.\n\nState Sen. John Edwards (D) flatly rejected offering Fairfax\u2019s accuser a forum, arguing that the allegation was less credible than the one against Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cWe believe [Fairfax],\u201d he said. \u201cThe Washington Post indicated they can\u2019t corroborate anything from [his accuser].\u201d\n\nDel. Karrie Delaney (D) did not reply to a question about whether Fairfax\u2019s accuser deserved a hearing in the General Assembly.\n\nWhen asked about providing an opportunity for the accuser to testify, Del. Hala Ayala (D) appeared to remember something she urgently needed to attend to and walked away.\n\nMany lawmakers cited their focus on the flood of bills they had to vote on before the end of Tuesday, which is crossover day. Each chamber of the state legislature has until the end of the work day to finish passing its own bills for the session; tomorrow they must start looking at the other chamber\u2019s bills.\n\nAsked for her reaction to the allegation against Fairfax, House Democratic Leader Eileen Filler-Corn (D) said, \u201cBusy with bills and focused on matters at hand right now.\u201d She then briskly walked away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so busy with session crossover that we really don\u2019t have time\u201d to react to the Fairfax allegation, said Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler (D), who was unaware that the lieutenant governor\u2019s accuser had hired an attorney.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got so many bills ahead of us now,\u201d said Delaney. \u201cThe people have sent us here to deliver results so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers professed ignorance about the matter.\n\nHad Del. Vivian Watts (D) had a moment to read up on the Fairfax allegation?\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read anything!\u201d Watts replied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Del. Mark Levine (D), when asked for his opinion.\n\nAsked how the situation differed from the allegation against Kavanaugh, Levine again said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d before exiting the House floor through a side door.\n\nAnother reporter asked Delaney what kind of message it sent for Democrats to press for transparency in the Kavanaugh case, but remain relatively silent about Fairfax. Delaney did not respond. But Levine, having returned to the floor, interjected, \u201cIt sends a message that we\u2019re working hard!\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grace-meng-sotu-dreamer-rhodes-scholar_us_5c588c76e4b0871047567b0f": "Rep.

A big part of the problem is that Trump is flying through judicial nominations without much vetting, and he\u2019s not submitting his potential court picks to the ABA before he announces their nominations. Traditionally, presidents have waited for the ABA rating to come out before officially announcing a nominee, in part to save face in the event one of their nominees gets a particularly bad rating.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, for example, didn\u2019t nominate any of his potential court picks whom the ABA rated unqualified.\n\nKobes drew opposition from more than 200 civil and human rights groups over remarks he made in a 2017 interview on LGBTQ rights and religion, when he claimed that \u201ctraditional conservative ideas on the family have gone out.\u201d He also raised concerns over his decision to represent, on a pro bono basis, crisis pregnancy centers (i.e. fake women\u2019s health care centers) that defended a state counseling law requiring abortion providers to tell a woman seeking an abortion that it would increase the likelihood of suicide.\n\n\u201cHe voluntarily defended a law requiring providers to give a lecture full of ideological propaganda and fear-mongering to women seeking safe, legal abortions,\u201d Sen.

Democrats hope to build a record of evidence to prevent that if their bill becomes a law.\n\nIn his majority opinion for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the formula used by the Department of Justice to determine discrimination relied on outdated data and evidence that did not reflect the changed nature of race relations in the United States. And Congress used that same outdated data, according to Roberts, when it reauthorized the act in 2006 instead of crafting a new formula based on more recent data and evidence of discrimination.\n\n\u201cCongress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current conditions,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cIt instead reenacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.\u201d\n\nVoting rights activists and Democratic Party politicians vehemently disagreed with Roberts\u2019 ruling in the Shelby County case. But they recognize that any future reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act needs to have a developed record of evidence built alongside it to withstand scrutiny from the conservative Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cObviously, we felt that before Shelby there was plenty of evidence of necessitating the Voting Rights Act to be kept as it was, but the Supreme Court felt otherwise,\u201d said Todd Cox, policy director for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \u201cAnd I think, quite frankly, there\u2019s been ample evidence subsequent to Shelby pointing to the need to restore the Voting Rights Act. We have at least 10 cases where courts, federal courts have found intentional discrimination against voters.\u201d\n\nThose cases include the passage of voter identification laws in Texas and North Carolina, and North Carolina\u2019s roll-back of early voting, same-day registration and registration drives, changes that targeted African-Americans with \u201csurgical precision,\u201d according to a federal court. They could also include the kind of voter purges deployed in Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race between Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the incoming oversight committee chairman, has already stated he wants to call Kemp in to testify.\n\nDemocrats will hold votes on both their big democracy reform package and the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, which will be introduced by Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), next year.

Republicans refused to move any fix for the Voting Rights Act after the Shelby decision in the past three Congresses.\n\nWhether Senate Republicans support these bills or not, Democrats see passing them in the House as a necessary statement of what their party stands for and what it would do if it controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-farr-nomination-voting-rights_us_5bfc3652e4b0eb6d93126cba": "Alex Brandon, File/ASSOCIATED PRESS Thomas Farr is sworn in during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination to be a district judge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Sept. 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 The Senate is expected to vote this week on whether to confirm a judicial nominee who helped draft North Carolina\u2019s voter suppression law and defended racially discriminatory gerrymandering, and who was accused of lying to lawmakers about his role in disenfranchising black voters in the 1990s.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines in January to advance the nomination of Thomas Farr, 64, a lawyer whom President Donald Trump picked for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The nomination has faced particularly vocal opposition from black lawmakers, civil rights groups and the NAACP, who claim that Farr intentionally disenfranchised voters of color and undermined workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cFor the Senate to first bring up the judicial nominee known as the \u2018vote-suppressor-in-chief\u2019 adds insult to injury,\u201d said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau. \u201cIt makes crystal clear who stands for voting rights and who stands for voting wrongs.\u201d\n\nAll of the 49 members who caucus with Democrats in the Senate have pledged to vote against Farr. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has indicated he will not support any more of Trump\u2019s judicial picks until Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) allows a vote on legislation protecting special counsel Robert Mueller. This means Democrats would only need to pick up one more vote to sink Farr\u2019s nomination.\n\nAs an attorney, Farr helped write a 2013 North Carolina law that activated a number of voting restrictions, including cutting early voting and requiring voter ID. The GOP-led legislature then hired Farr to defend the law in a federal lawsuit challenging it. During a hearing in the case, Farr denied that the law was intentionally discriminatory, and said it was \u201cnot a nefarious thing.\u201d But in 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit struck down the law, saying North Carolina lawmakers enacted changes that they knew would disproportionately affect African-Americans. The law, the court said, targeted black people \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal of the decision.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans also hired Farr to defend their state and congressional legislative plans. Some of those districts were struck down as unlawfully racially gerrymandered in decisions upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe timing of Farr\u2019s vote in the Senate \u2015 after the midterm elections, and nearly 10 months after he was advanced out of committee \u2015 suggests that Republicans recognized they\u2019d have an easier time pushing through his nomination during the lame-duck period before a new Congress is seated in January. Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to pick off at least one moderate GOP senator, like Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) or Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), to join them in defeating Farr\u2019s nomination. They are also targeting lawmakers like Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), the GOP\u2019s lone African-American senator, and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), both of whom helped sink a Trump judicial nominee this summer over his racist writings.\n\nFarr\u2019s vote \u201cis a litmus test for voting rights in the Senate,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) wrote on Twitter last week. \u201cI think we stand a good chance of succeeding.\u201d\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Farr faced questions about his work as a lawyer for former Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in 1990. Just before Election Day that year, Helms\u2019 campaign targeted black voters with over 100,000 postcards that had incorrect information about voter qualifications. The postcards warned readers that they could face criminal charges for illegally voting, an intimidation tactic.\n\nFarr told senators he did not know about the postcard scheme until the Justice Department contacted the campaign about it, but a former Justice Department official said Farr attended a meeting about \u201cballot security\u201d before the postcards were sent out.\n\nAsked about the discrepancy, Farr later told senators he had attended the meeting but did not discuss the postcards there.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-thomas-farr-nomination-voting-rights_us_5bfdbbe2e4b0f03cd030ca1e": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Democrats are so close to sinking one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most controversial judicial nominees, Thomas Farr, they can practically taste it.\n\nThey only need one more Republican to vote with them against Farr, who has drawn widespread criticism from civil rights groups and has been referred to as the \u201cvote-suppressor-in-chief\u201d for building a legal career out of trying to weaken black voters\u2019 rights. The Senate is voting this week to advance Farr\u2019s nomination, with a final confirmation vote likely either late this week or next week.\n\nThe 64-year-old attorney helped write North Carolina\u2019s extreme voter ID law in 2013 that was later struck down by a federal appeals court, which found that it targeted African-Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d Farr defended racially discriminatory gerrymandering in federal court in 2015 (and lost), and he may have lied to the Senate about his role in disenfranchising black voters in 1990 when he worked for the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).\n\nFarr\u2019s chances of confirmation come down to a handful of GOP senators who have been evasive about how they\u2019ll vote. Republicans hold such a slim majority in the Senate that if just two GOP senators join Democrats in opposing Farr, his nomination would go down. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has already said he will oppose all of Trump\u2019s nominees until he gets a vote on a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller. That puts Farr\u2019s current vote count at 50-50, which means Vice President Mike Pence would have to break the tie even if all the other GOP senators vote yes.\n\nDemocrats and civil rights groups are holding out hope that Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) will join them in voting no. They have reason to be hopeful: In addition to being the lone African-American senator in his party, Scott holds the rare distinction of being a Republican senator who previously opposed one of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, circuit court pick Ryan Bounds \u2015 and it was over Bounds\u2019 racist writings in college. Scott\u2019s vote tanked that nominee.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that if he opposed the 9th Circuit nominee based on his college writings that he could possibly vote for this nominee, whose entire career is aimed at African-Americans,\u201d said D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), who leads the Congressional Black Caucus\u2019 task force on judicial nominations. \u201cSo I am very hopeful, even though I have not had any indication from the senator\u2019s office, that he is studying this and will try to make this vote consistent with his prior vote.\u201d\n\nScott refused to answer any questions about Farr on Tuesday, telling reporters that he is still \u201cdoing my homework\u201d on a nominee who has been out there for over a year.\n\n\u201cI have no answers on the Farr nomination whatsoever,\u201d Scott told HuffPost, adding that he doesn\u2019t plan to speak with him again. \u201cI met with him months ago.\u201d\n\nFarr\u2019s opponents are also looking to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to join them. She recently opposed Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, and she has occasionally voted with Democrats on issues like health care and abortion.\n\nAsked about Farr on Tuesday, Murkowski told HuffPost that she has made up her mind on how she\u2019ll vote but doesn\u2019t want to share it.\n\nEarlier in the day, a Murkowski aide said the senator \u201cdoesn\u2019t plan on blocking\u201d Farr\u2019s nomination. But the aide did not clarify whether that meant Murkowski would be voting to advance Farr\u2019s nomination on the procedural vote but not necessarily voting to confirm him in the end.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in September 2017, Farr faced questions about his work as a lawyer for Helms. Just before Election Day that year, Helms\u2019 campaign targeted black voters with over 100,000 postcards that had incorrect information about voter qualifications. The postcards warned readers that they could face criminal charges for illegally voting, an intimidation tactic. Farr testified that he did not know about the scheme, but a former Justice Department official said Farr attended a meeting about \u201cballot security\u201d before the postcards were sent out.\n\n\u201cHe had absolutely nothing to do with the racist postcard that was sent out,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cHe, in fact, told me that he was disgusted by it and he clearly played no role in drafting it, approving it or even seeing it.\u201d\n\nCollins said she will vote to confirm Farr because the American Bar Association rated him \u201cwell qualified.\u201d She also said, unexpectedly, that her concerns were alleviated in part because Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama, \u201cstrongly supports\u201d Farr\u2019s nomination.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the committee was unaware of any letter of support from Ruemmler with regard to Farr\u2019s nomination. Ruemmler declined to comment.\n\nCivil rights groups have been fighting Farr\u2019s nomination for nearly a year. On Tuesday, they organized a last-minute call with reporters to walk through the details of his decades-long career of disenfranchising black voters.\n\n\u201cFarr is the embodiment of Trump\u2019s anti-civil rights agenda,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cHe is an egregious extension of the administration\u2019s campaign to build barriers to voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that the Senate would even consider someone with Farr\u2019s record,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \u201cIn 2018, this should simply be unacceptable.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alyssa-milano-equal-rights-amendment-me-too_us_5c587024e4b09293b206f787": "Last week, actress Alyssa Milano went to Washington to fight for the Equal Rights Amendment, part of a renewed effort to finally update the Constitution to explicitly include women.\n\nIt seems absurd but the Constitution does not specifically grant women equal rights under the law, setting the U.S. apart from 131 other nations that explicitly guarantee gender equality in their constitutions. The ERA, first proposed nearly a century ago, came very close to passing in the 1970s and then disappeared from view until recently.\n\nMilano, 46, has been busy these past few years. She was working on the Netflix show \u201dInsatiable\u201d in October 2017 when she tweeted, \u201cIf you\u2019ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write \u2018me too\u2019 as a reply to this tweet,\u201d helping kick off a massive social movement. (Milano didn\u2019t invent the hashtag; social activist Tarana Burke used the phrase \u201cMe Too\u201d as early as 2006.)\n\nLast year, Milano rallied with the survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and sat just behind Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearings. Her presence there was immortalized by \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which included a cardboard cutout of Milano in a sketch about the hearing that featured Matt Damon as the red-faced Supreme Court nominee.\n\nMilano spoke with HuffPost by phone about women\u2019s rights, the future of Me Too and how she teaches her kids, Bella, 4, and Milo, 7, about consent.\n\nThis interview was condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about now versus the last time, when the ERA didn\u2019t pass?\n\nSadly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot different. We\u2019re still fighting to get one state. [Activists are pushing for Virginia to become the 38th state to ratify the amendment.] I\u2019d hoped in my heart that this would be such a no-brainer. It should be commonsense to say, yes, we should enshrine women in the Constitution, but unfortunately we\u2019re still having to fight that battle.\n\nWhat would be better or different with the ERA in effect?\n\nJust the perception of being equal \u2015 and having the weight of the Constitution behind you gives a perception of equality. Real tangible things: equal pay for equal work; [prohibitions on] maternity discrimination, lactation discrimination, the \u201cpink tax.\u201d Being taken seriously as far as women\u2019s health care. Not being overlooked when you are reporting domestic violence.\n\nThinking about gender equality \u2015 you\u2019ve just been to the Capitol. Who is further behind: Hollywood or Washington?\n\nWashington. There is still a lot hidden about sexual misconduct in Washington. I think there\u2019s more corruption because of coverups. I think there\u2019s no transparency.\n\nIf you look at Hollywood right now, it\u2019s pretty transparent. People know they\u2019re under the microscope. We are talking about it. Everyone is fully and totally aware of the problem.\n\nWhere do you think Me Too is right now? The New York Times just ran a story about powerful men now afraid to mentor women.\n\nThe movement\u2019s not going anywhere. There\u2019s too many women who\u2019ve been hurt and we\u2019ve all found our voice.\n\nUnless you\u2019re a man who feels like they\u2019re going to commit an abuse of power, I wouldn\u2019t worry about [mentoring women].\n\nAre you making room for women of color and men in the movement?\n\nAlways. If we don\u2019t fix our problems with people who are marginalized and people that are most at risk, people that really feel like they can\u2019t speak up, I don\u2019t think this movement will succeed.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Rose McGowan and how she went from being a Me Too avatar to having a more complicated role? [McGowan, who co-starred with Milano on the TV show \u201cCharmed,\u201d has publicly called Milano \u201ca lie.\u201d]\n\nI think that what has happened to Rose in the past has been so traumatizing that she\u2019s dealing the best that she can. She\u2019s always been very strong in who she is. I can\u2019t even go there as far as what that trauma must\u2019ve been like and to have to relive it in such a public way.\n\nPersonally, the fact she attacked me in the process, I think, is super fucked up, but I can look at her and say that this is a person hurting and hope she finds the strength and love she needs to heal.\n\nWhat did you think of that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sendup of you at the Kavanaugh hearings?\n\nI loved it so much. That was such a hard week. Right from the Kavanaugh hearing, I went to Parkland to be with the community. I was sitting in bed in Florida and my phone kept blowing up. Once I saw it on the internet, I died. It was awesome. I asked [\u201cSNL\u201d] if I could have [the cardboard cutout], but they said they were gonna keep it to use again.\n\nYou should just go on \u201cSNL.\u201d\n\nAgreed.\n\nLet\u2019s say you had the power of premonition, like your character on \u201cCharmed.\u201d Tell me what the future for women looks like.\n\nI see the ERA being ratified and passed within two years and Me Too continuing to heal survivors. And Tarana Burke continuing to do amazing work.\n\nDid you march in the Women\u2019s March last month?\n\nI did not. I marched around my kitchen with my daughter. That was my marching.\n\nDo your kids know about Me Too?\n\nNot directly. Indirectly, yes, we\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations about consent \u2015 not in a sexual way, just asking permission to, you know, hold Bella\u2019s hand or give Bella a hug. \u201cDid you ask consent? Do you have consent to play with that toy?\u201d I think we teach these lessons too late. We teach when they\u2019re hormonal and prepubescent. We should set the foundation when they\u2019re little.\n\nOver the summer I dropped Bella off at camp and they were going swimming.

The Republican-led state Legislature has other ideas.\n\nThe Utah Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would toss out a grassroots-driven, voter-backed ballot initiative to offer Medicaid benefits to any Utahn earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000 a year for a single person), paid for by raising the sales tax on certain goods from 4.7 percent to 4.85 percent.\n\nThe legislation instead would expand Medicaid to fewer people, enable Utah to receive less federal money for the program and impose limitations on benefits, including work requirements. And the entire plan hinges on a dubious promise of federal approval for aspects of the state Senate bill.\n\nThe Utah GOP clearly is prioritizing overturning the voters, considering the Legislature has been in session since just Monday and the bill made it out its Senate committee Tuesday and to the floor Wednesday. The fact that 53 percent of voters spoke in favor of a full Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in November is not swaying Utah Republican legislators, who have resisted the expansion since it became available in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative, known as Proposition 3, not only received majority support statewide but also in most state Senate districts, the Utah Health Policy Project reported. According to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis of the vote Wednesday, 10 Republican senators representing districts where a majority voted in favor of the expansion are supporting the bill to modify it, including the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Allen Christensen. A plurality of Utahns opposes changing the voter-backed policy, according to a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defer to the will of the people at some point,\u201d said state Rep. Brian King, the minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives and one of 16 Democrats in the 75-member lower chamber of the Utah State Legislature. \u201cWe should not be doing anything to substantively alter that Proposition 3 in a way that delays the implementation one more day.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill sends a message to voters, King said: \u201cWe don\u2019t really care what the people of the state of Utah want to do or say they want us to do at the Legislature. We\u2019re going to do what we want to do. That\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d\n\nThese actions by Utah Republican lawmakers are reminiscent of how then-Gov. Paul LePage (R) defied Maine voters last year by refusing to carry out a Medicaid expansion they approved in 2017. LePage\u2019s successor, Gov. Janet Mills (D), has already begun the process of implementing the expansion. In Idaho, where voters also passed a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, a conservative organization is challenging it before the state Supreme Court.\n\nEfforts by Republicans at the state level to undo or limit the Medicaid expansion, including the seven states that received federal approval for work requirements and the eight more seeking it, mirror the national Republican strategy on health care.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress devoted most of 2017 to attempting and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with plans that would have left millions without health coverage. And in December, a federal judge ruled in favor of 20 GOP state officials who argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in a lawsuit supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nRick Bowmer/Associated Press Tiffiny Malo, left, and Pam Harrison, supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid, at a rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law during the first day of the Utah Legislature on Monday.\n\nThe Utah Senate must vote again on the bill to significantly alter the Medicaid expansion enacted by voters, which it approved once this week against the opposition of all six Democratic senators and one of the chamber\u2019s 23 Republicans. The state House is poised to act quickly on the legislation after the Senate is finished.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving very quickly,\u201d said King, who expects the Utah House will pass the Senate bill by the end of next week.\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert has not taken a public position on the Medicaid bill. In response to questions from HuffPost, Herbert\u2019s office provided a statement from a spokesman.\n\n\u201cGov. Herbert has long supported the kind of common-sense guardrails for Medicaid expansion that are being discussed in the legislature. Many were components of his proposed Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion in 2015; most of these were part of legislation that he signed into law last general session. His primary concerns are that the state honor the will of the voters to fill the hole in the social safety net by helping those under the poverty line without health insurance and to implement without delay,\u201d Paul Edwards said in the statement.\n\nLast week, Herbert said he believed the state should allow the expansion to move forward as approved by voters and then be revisited at a later date. During his State of the State address Thursday, Herbert said only that \u201cthe much-needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay.\u201d\n\nBecause Republicans have supermajorities in the Utah House and Senate, however, the GOP would have the votes to override a veto even if Herbert decided to oppose the Medicaid legislation.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and the federal government finances at least 90 percent of the cost. This expansion was meant to be in place nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate. To date, 14 states have declined it. Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voters all approved expansion via ballot initiative last year, but the program is not yet in place in those states. Under the terms of the Utah initiative, benefits are supposed to become available April 1.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative was straightforward in its approach by simply instructing the state to join the Medicaid expansion without any changes to the state\u2019s existing program or the need for federal approval. The Utah Governor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget assessed that the sales tax increase would raise more than enough money to finance the state\u2019s 10 percent share of the expansion\u2019s cost, although it noted that the revenue and costs in future years may not match up.\n\nBy contrast, the Utah Senate bill would trigger a complicated and uncertain process that would cover fewer people under Medicaid. The Senate began action on the measure before the Legislature\u2019s budget scorekeepers could analyze the legislation\u2019s effects, but it is designed to limit the Medicaid expansion\u2019s reach. That\u2019s despite the fact that the measure would leave the sales tax increase in place while also imposing a tax on hospitals that alone is intended to be large enough to cover the state\u2019s entire share of the expense of Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder the Senate legislation, Medicaid benefits would be available only to those with incomes below the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person. Utahns with incomes higher than that would continue to have access to subsidized private coverage via the health insurance exchange in the state. Unlike the Medicaid expansion voters approved, the state would receive about 70 percent of the funding for the partial Medicaid expansion from the federal government instead of the 90 percent offered by a full expansion.\n\nThe bill lacks detail on many key elements of the modified expansion, leaving those to the state\u2019s executive branch and federal officials to hash out. In order to maintain April 1 as the day benefits would come online, legislative Republicans are counting on all of that happening on an extraordinarily expedited basis.\n\n\u201cThis entire thing is being rammed through the Senate and the House as quickly as possible. It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters, that they\u2019re disrespecting voters by doing so,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a Washington-based organization that supported Medicaid ballot initiatives in Utah, Idaho, Maine, Montana and Nebraska over the past two years.\n\nIt is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project\n\nThe Herbert administration would have to resolve all the outstanding questions the bill poses and the federal government would have to approve waivers for standard Medicaid rules in less than two months, which is much more quickly than it typically acts.\n\n\u201cNothing about how the federal government moves and operates gives me much hope or assurance that you\u2019re going to get a waiver at all, much less one in a time frame that is going to be less than 60 days,\u201d King said.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty pertains to the funding. Under the legislation, Utah would ask the federal government to break precedent by providing the full 90 percent funding for a partial expansion. The Trump administration last year rejected such requests from Arkansas and Massachusetts, following the Obama administration\u2019s policy against partial expansions.\n\nUtah has even tried this before. Herbert signed legislation last year approving a partial expansion and submitted a request for approval to federal authorities. That would have covered about half as many people as a full Medicaid expansion. The state withdrew its application after the ballot initiative passed.\n\nThe new bill also calls for work requirements and for locking out enrollees who fail to meet them, but it does not specify what they would be and how they would be enforced. It also would cap enrollment for otherwise eligible Utahns if cost projections for the expansion exceed the amount of money appropriated for the year.\n\nThe attempt to overturn voters on Medicaid expansion comes a month after Herbert signed legislation to replace a medical marijuana initiative voters approved last year with a new law. In the aftermath of voters passing the marijuana and Medicaid measures, Utah lawmakers also are eying changes to the ballot initiative process to let the Legislature alter voter-backed policies before they take effect.\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from a spokesman for Utah Gov. Gary Herbert.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-voting-rights_us_5c59e0ebe4b09293b208d7f7": "When it came time to ask a question during a hearing on voting rights on Monday, Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) chose a simple one.\n\n\u201cI just want to ask one question off the top, since my colleagues continue to talk about voter fraud. Do you see a lot of voter fraud?\u201d she said Monday during the first meeting of a subcommittee focused on elections and voting in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIt was something of a rhetorical question for the panel of longtime Texas voting rights litigators whom Democrats had picked to testify. George Korbel, one of the witnesses, quickly responded: \u201cAlmost none.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh OK, I just want to be sure, because that\u2019s the narrative,\u201d Fudge told those at the meeting, which was only attended by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s not violations of the Voting Rights Act \u2015 it\u2019s voter fraud.\u201d\n\nFudge kept a straight face during her question, but it was easy to hear the simmering frustration. For years, Republicans have attempted to justify the need for new voting restrictions by exaggerating the existence of voter fraud, which in reality is very rare. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, saying it was outdated. The eliminated provision sat at the heart of the VRA: a formula requiring jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination to preclear their voting changes with the federal government.\n\nDemocrats have made voting rights a top priority since they won control of the House of Representatives in November, and the subcommittee Fudge is chairing is charged with compiling a record of discrimination that can be used to justify a new formula to require certain places to preclear their voting changes. Reinstating the preclearance provision would be a remarkably powerful legislative triumph, because in theory it would block discriminatory voting policies from going into effect. However, such a measure is unlikely to get support from Republicans, who control the Senate.\n\nBut Fudge\u2019s question on Monday underscored how Democrats, newly empowered in the House, are aggressively pushing back on allegations of fraud while also documenting the very real evidence of voter suppression in the United States.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) is chairing a subcommittee compiling evidence that can be used to reinstate a powerful provision of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAs Democrats build that record, they are working to expose specious allegations of voter fraud and demonstrate that a much larger problem is laws that make it more difficult for poor people and people of color to vote. After the Supreme Court reached its 2013 decision, states moved swiftly to implement voting restrictions that included measures like voter ID requirements and cuts to early voting.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing last month, Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) pressed J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department lawyer who has pushed misleading claims of voter fraud, about allegations of voter suppression in Georgia. Adams testified that \u201cit has never been easier to register to vote and to vote in America than it is in 2019,\u201d so Bass wanted to know if those claims of suppression were just made up.\n\nAdams said Brian Kemp, at the time Georgia\u2019s top election official, was acting within the law last year when he didn\u2019t recuse himself from overseeing his own race for governor, and that Kemp was exercising \u201creasonable list maintenance\u201d when he aggressively removed voters from the state rolls.\n\n\u201cYou call it reasonable list maintenance?\u201d Bass said. \u201cI think it\u2019s called voter suppression.\u201d\n\nYou call it reasonable list maintenance? I think it\u2019s called voter suppression. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) on Brian Kemp's purging of the Georgia voter rolls\n\nAdams did acknowledge it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d untrue to say people of color have encountered particular difficulty voting in some cases, although Bass moved to another speaker before he could go into detail.\n\nIn another exchange at the January hearing, Hans von Spakovsky, another former Justice Department lawyer who has made misleading fraud accusations, accused Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, of \u201cwildly exaggerating\u201d instances of voter suppression.\n\nThe comment prompted a strong response from Bass, who pointed to numerous examples of voter suppression that Ifill and Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, had just testified about.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said enough,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThe idea that we did not have problems in the 2018 election \u2015 the idea that all the testimony from Ms. Gupta and Ms. Ifill was just an exaggeration \u2015 is really an embarrassment. And I think people ought to be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky went on to argue that voter discrimination in the United States is \u201crare.\u201d He pointed to voter identification laws in Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina that allow someone to vote if they do not have an acceptable ID but have a \u201creasonable impediment.\u201d\n\nGupta and Ifill quickly pointed out inconsistencies in von Spakovsky\u2019s comments. Gupta noted that in 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit struck down the North Carolina law, saying it targeted African-Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d Ifill noted that the \u201creasonable impediment\u201d exceptions were only implemented after officials reached settlements in lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of testimony that I think is so disturbing, because it is so misleading,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of shading of the truth, shading of the reality of what it takes for lawyers and communities to challenge discriminatory voting practices.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-muslim-ban-2-years_us_5c50b9dae4b00906b26e2ee4": "Photo provided by Mohamed Alahiry For nearly a decade, Mohamed Alahiry split his time between Yemen and New York City, where he and his father owned a Brooklyn bodega. When the Yemeni civil war broke out in 2014, Alahiry wanted to bring his daughters to safety in America.\n\nMohamed Alahiry is proud of the fact that he comes from a long line of Americans. His family first came to the United States from Yemen in 1928, and, like his great-grandfathers, grandfather and father before him, the 33-year-old calls the U.S. home.\n\nAnd like the other men in his family, he had hoped to bring his wife from Yemen to the United States to raise their four daughters here together. For now, his wife and 12-year-old daughter remain in limbo abroad.\n\nAnd with President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban still in effect, Alahiry isn\u2019t sure if he will ever be able to reunite with his family.\n\nTwo years ago this week, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen, from entering the U.S. (It has been revised multiple times and challenged repeatedly in federal courts; last year the ban was upheld by the Supreme Court over lower court decisions calling it unconstitutional.) The effect of the ban was chaotic and traumatic. Travelers were stranded at airports, newlyweds were torn apart and civilians seeking medical attention were denied visas to enter the country for treatment. Some Americans were forced to make the difficult decision to leave the U.S. and move to war-torn countries just to be with their families.\n\nTwo years later \u2014 despite attempts by the courts to block the ban, and despite an amendment ostensibly created to give people suffering hardship a legal process for immigration \u2014 families like Alahiry\u2019s are still struggling to reunite.\n\n\u201cThe American people, including and most importantly Congress members, need to realize that this [ban is still] unconstitutional,\u201d said Ayyad Algabyali, the director of advocacy at Yemeni American Merchants, an advocacy organization that was founded after the 2017 Yemeni bodega strike to support local merchants and businesses.\n\nAlahiry and his wife met in Sana\u2019a, the capital of Yemen, and were married there in 2005. (The family asked to withhold her name.) For nearly a decade, Alahiry split his time between Sana\u2019a and New York City, where he and his father owned a bodega in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn. When the Yemeni civil war broke out in 2014, Alahiry knew he needed to bring their four children to safety in America.\n\nThe violence quickly escalated, forcing the U.S. Embassy in Sana\u2019a to close in early 2015 and refer all its Yemen cases to nearby Djibouti. The airports shut down, making Djibouti accessible only by a dangerous 18-hour boat ride from Yemen\u2019s coast. Scores of migrants drowned in attempts to make the crossing. Alahiry\u2019s wife was terrified to embark on the journey with their children, who were toddlers at the time.\n\nHer visa application stuck in limbo in Djibouti, she and her kids remained in Yemen until 2017, when they fled to Egypt. Alahiry requested that his wife\u2019s case be transferred to the U.S. Embassy there, but by then Trump\u2019s ban was in place and Alahiry\u2019s wife, unable to return to Yemen and barred from immigrating to the United States, was stranded.\n\nPhoto provided by Mohamed Alahiry While driving with his now 8-year-old daughter on a visit to Cairo in October, Alahiry got into a car accident. He broke his leg. She fractured her rib cage and foot.\n\nLast October, things went from bad to worse. While driving with his now 8-year-old daughter on a visit to Cairo, Alahiry got into a severe car accident. He broke his leg, and she fractured her rib cage and foot.\n\nAlahiry and his daughter were taken to New York City to be treated for their injuries. Two of her sisters, all U.S. citizens, came to New York, too. (The eldest remained with their mother in Cairo.) After seven surgeries, Alahiry was unable to work. He was eventually forced to send two of the girls to live with his brother in North Carolina.\n\nHis family became even more scattered.\n\n\u201cMy daughters are always on the phone crying to each other \u2015 this one wants to go here and the other one wants to go there. There\u2019s nothing in my hands to do. I can\u2019t even take care of myself these days,\u201d Alahiry told HuffPost.\n\nIn another attempt to bring his wife to the U.S., he tried to take advantage of an exception to the travel ban that allows nationals from the banned countries to apply for a waiver if those citizens are able to prove hardship \u2014 a result of the June 2018 Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe Yemeni American Merchants Association submitted a waiver letter on Alahiry\u2019s behalf and requested that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo expedite his wife\u2019s interview and subsequent visa application. The embassy refused.\n\n\u201cThis waiver is a sham. Waivers aren\u2019t being granted to anyone,\u201d said Algabyali. Algabyali, who oversees Alahiry\u2019s case, said his organization has come across hundreds of cases that would qualify for a waiver and hasn\u2019t seen a single family receive one.\n\nA waiver, the one and only legal clause meant to prove that the ban is not discriminatory, is notoriously hard to get.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The New York Times last week, Betsy Fisher, the policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, and Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, sharply criticized the waiver process and said the waivers appear to \u201cbe given reliably only when much publicity is brought to bear.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joni-ernst-sexual-assault-college_us_5c492ab8e4b0e1872d40ebec": "Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said Wednesday that she was raped when she was in college, a revelation she chose to make after intimate deals of her divorce were made public this week.\n\nThe lawmaker, one of the highest-ranking women in Congress, told Bloomberg News that she was sexually assaulted by someone she was dating while studying at Iowa State University. She said that the man was physically and verbally abusive during their relationship and that she broke up with him after speaking to someone at a campus counseling center. She said she didn\u2019t report the rape to police.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to share it with anybody, and in the era of hashtag-MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they\u2019re ready,\u201d the senator told Bloomberg News on Wednesday, before adding, \u201cAnd I was not ready.\u201d\n\nErnst has been subject to heavy media scrutiny this week over her divorce from her husband, Gail Ernst. In documents made public due to state law, the senator said she was subjected to emotional and physical abuse during her 25-year marriage.\n\n\u201cGail has been very cruel. This has been an extremely painful journey,\u201d Ernst wrote in an affidavit first reported by the Iowa newspaper Cityview and the Des Moines Register on Tuesday. The documents have since been sealed at the request of the Ernsts.\n\nTheir divorce was first announced in August and became finalized on Jan. 3.\n\nChris Kleponis, pool/Getty Images \u2033People know my situation now. What I can do is be honest about what happened,\u201d Ernst told Bloomberg.\n\nErnst has been a high-profile supporter of President Donald Trump throughout his first term. She also voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year amid outrage over allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.\n\nThe lawmaker moved to distance her personal trauma from her politics in the Bloomberg interview, however, saying it was \u201coutrageous to suggest that anyone who has been the victim of sexual assault should therefore be a Hillary Clinton supporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was embarrassed,\u201d Ernst said of her response at the time of the assault. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to explain it. I was so humiliated. And I\u2019m a private person, when it comes to those things.\u201d\n\nShe said she planned to seek re-election in 2020 in what\u2019s expected to be a difficult fight to retain her seat. But Ernst noted she was prepared to campaign as \u201ca single woman\u201d who can now move forward."}
