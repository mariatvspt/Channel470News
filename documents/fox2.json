Earlier on Thursday, they said: \"We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.\"\n\nSmollett walked out of the Cook County jail in Chicago on Thursday afternoon, about two hours after a hearing in which the judge set his bond at $100,000. Taking a stern tone, the judge called his alleged staging of a hate crime \"outrageous.\"\n\nCHICAGO POLICE BLAST JUSSIE SMOLLETT 'PHONY ATTACK': 'BOGUS POLICE REPORTS CAUSE REAL HARM'\n\nFollowing three weeks of mounting suspicions, Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct. He turned himself in at central booking early Thursday. If convicted, he'll face up to three years in prison.\n\nChicago police laid out their case against Smollett Thursday morning, accusing the TV star of orchestrating an elaborate hoax via two \"bogus\" hate crimes -- one employing an alleged attack, and one involving a threatening letter -- all in order to secure a pay raise.\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett orchestrated a \"phony attack\" in order to take \"advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.\"\n\n'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S BOND SET AT $100G, JUDGE CALLS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM 'OUTRAGEOUS'\n\n\"I'm left hanging my head and asking why,\" a visibly upset Johnson told reporters. \"Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol? ... How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city by making this false claim?\"\n\nHe added, \"Bogus police reports cause real harm.\"\n\nSmollett told police he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop around 2 a.m on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled, \"This is MAGA country\" \u2014 an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\" \u2014 before fleeing.\n\nWhy would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? \u2014 Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson\n\nJUSSIE SMOLLETT'S CELEBRITY SUPPORTERS LARGELY SILENT AFTER CHICAGO POLICE BLAST 'EMPIRE' ACTOR'S 'HOAX'\n\nBut this isn't how prosecutors and police say things actually unfolded.\n\nProsecutors said at the actor's bond hearing on that Smollett misled police and the public to believe that his attackers were white when he told police his primary attacker was wearing a ski mask that only exposed the area around his eyes.\n\nPolice said Smollett hired two black men to help him carry out the hoax. According to prosecutors, Smollett told the two brothers to attack him, shout out the MAGA line, and put a rope around his neck.\n\nJUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS\n\n\"He instructed them to get his attention by yelling '\"Empire\" F--' and '\"Empire\" n-----' [and] instructed them to give him a chance to appear to fight back,\" Assistant State Attorney Risa Lanier said. Lanier said he provided them with $100 to purchase a red hat (the MAGA slogan is often found on red ballcaps) masks and gloves.\n\nSuperintendent Johnson said police found the \"check that [Smollett] used to pay [the brothers]\" to fake the beating, adding that he paid them $3,500 \"for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.\"\n\nHe said the attack \"was staged\" and \"as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett's] face was most likely self-inflicted.\"\n\nAbsolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared ... admitting what he did and then be man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this \u2014 Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson\n\nJohnson was also incensed at the spotlight the incident put on his town for the past three weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is shameful because it painted this city that we all love and work hard in, in a negative connotation,\" he said. \"To insinuate and stage a hate crime of that nature when he knew that as a celebrity he\u2019d get a lot of attention\u2026 It\u2019s despicable.

Police said one of the men had worked on \"Empire,\" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, \"Sum of My Music,\" last year.\n\nInvestigators said they have phone records that show there were extensive communications between Smollett and the brothers.

AP's Eric Tucker provides a debrief of the hearing. (Jan. 29) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Thursday ordered Roger Stone, the flamboyant political consultant charged with obstruction and lying to Congress, to stop talking about his case after he posted a picture of the judge on Instagram as part of a fundraising appeal.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had previously allowed Stone, an author who discusses politics on television, radio and the internet, to continue speaking so long as he didn't do so around the courthouse. She had ordered lawyers and witnesses not to discuss the case.\n\nJackson's stricter restrictions came after Stone posted a picture of the judge Monday next to what appeared to be a gun\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nJackson said Stone made his living through messages, so that she didn\u2019t believe the picture was chosen at random. She said the image could have stoked an angry crowd to violence.\n\n\u201cMr. Stone couldn\u2019t even keep his story straight on the stand,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow.\" She added: \"There's nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.\"\n\nJackson said her rules are designed to prevent the case from degenerating into a circus.\n\n\u201cThe publicity can\u2019t possibly subside if the defendant is out there fanning the flames,\u201d Jackson said as Stone leaned his head on his right fist. \u201cI have serious doubts about whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all.\u201d\n\nStone formally apologized for the \"improper\" post in a court filing Monday and repeatedly did so again Thursday while testifying under oath.\n\n\"I believe I abused the order,\" Stone said. \"I\u2019m kicking myself over my own stupidity, but not more than my wife is kicking me.\"\n\nStone, an off-and-on adviser to President Donald Trump, is charged by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team with obstruction and lying to Congress for statements about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released damaging emails about Democrat Hillary Clinton before the 2016 election. Stone was released on personal recognizance after he was arrested at his Florida home last month.\n\nStone has pleaded not guilty and said any misstatements were mistaken recollections rather than intentional lying. He has insisted he is innocent and attacked prosecutors on both social media and through television interviews.\n\nIn setting the hearing, Jackson also warned she could revoke Stone\u2019s release before trial. She didn't do that, but warned that she might if he violates her gag order.\n\nAt one point, Jackson asked whether Stone knew how to search with Google.\n\n\u201cHow hard was it to come up with a photograph that didn\u2019t have crosshairs in the corner?\" Jackson asked.\n\nStone said the image was chosen by one of five volunteers he couldn't specify because nobody would acknowledge giving it to him, but that he selected the picture from a couple of choices and posted it. Stone said he later studied the image and determined that it featured a Celtic occult sign rather than a gun's crosshairs.\n\n\"It was an error, your honor,\" Stone said. \"Nobody will own up to it,\" he said of his volunteers.\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, asked for restrictions on Stone's speaking outside court.\n\nStone's lawyer, Bruce Rogow, opposed greater restrictions. Stone testified that his consulting has dried up, leaving it difficult for him to put food on the table and pay the rent.\n\nRogow said the posting was the only mistake Stone had made under pretrial release, and that he posed no threat of fleeing the charges or danger to the community.\n\n\"Really what he\u2019s asking for is a second chance,\" Rogow said. \"It was completely inappropriate. It\u2019s indefensible.\"\n\nRogow had suggested that if Jackson did restrict Stone's speech, the restrictions should apply to talking about the charges, the prosecutors and the judge.\n\n\u201cIt was outrageous to see that picture, to see that text,\" Rogow said. \u201cThe government should not be criticized by Mr. Stone.\"\n\nThe Instagram post featured text pleading for contributions to his legal defense fund and noted that Jackson had been appointed by former President Barack Obama. Stone said the post had been a random picture taken from the internet and wasn't meant to threaten or disrespect the judge.\n\n\u201cPlease inform the court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted,\u201d Stone wrote in a note filed with the court Monday. \u201cI had no intention of disrespecting the court and humbly apologize to the court for the transgression.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges, was aware of Stone's post, spokesman Drew Wade said on Tuesday. He declined to comment on whether the service had provided additional security to Jackson.\n\nMore: Trump adviser Roger Stone pleads not guilty in Russia inquiry as he takes on a new role as defendant\n\nMore: Judge says Roger Stone can keep talking about his criminal case, but not on the courthouse steps\n\nMore: Roger Stone denies using Instagram post to threaten federal judge presiding over his case\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/21/judge-roger-stone-stop-talking-federal-case/2938729002/", "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/robert-mueller-report-russia-trump-antitrust-conspiracy.html": "President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands in Helsinki on July 16. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the special counsel investigation nears its end, its most anticipated area of inquiry remains unresolved: Did the Trump campaign \u201ccollude\u201d with Russia during the 2016 presidential election? Legally, the question of \u201ccollusion\u201d has always been a question of conspiracy. Any potential charges related to Russian collusion would likely allege a conspiracy to violate one or more federal statutes, such as those prohibiting fraud against the United States, foreign campaign assistance, or computer hacking.\n\nThat Mueller has not yet alleged a Trump-Russia conspiracy, despite convicting several Trump associates for other crimes, has fueled speculation that the special counsel may lack sufficient evidence to bring collusion-related charges. NPR recently wrote that \u201can ostensible conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russians who attacked the election is nowhere near close to being proven \u2026 From what we know today \u2026 the case is still Swiss cheese.\u201d Others have expressed similar skepticism based on the publicly available evidence.\n\nBut is the current evidence of Russian collusion really so lacking? Does it matter from a legal perspective that there may not be a \u201csmoking gun?\u201d One might expect the answers to these questions to come from previous instances of foreign election-tampering or other geopolitical scandals. But much of the best guidance comes from a less obvious place: the corporate world of antitrust law.\n\nAntitrust law\u2019s relevance to the Russia investigation stems from the unique relationship that existed between Trump and Russia during the campaign, which was more akin to rival businesses accused of price-fixing than traditional criminal associates. Unlike in a typical criminal conspiracy, where participants conceal their actions because they are illegal regardless of any underlying conspiracy (think drug dealers or bank robbers), Trump\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s policy objectives during the race was public and ostensibly legal so long as it was undertaken independently. From a conspiracy perspective, it was not illegal, standing alone, for the Trump campaign to meet with Russian agents, advocate easing Russian sanctions or dismantling NATO, negotiate a Trump Tower in Moscow, or publicly request that Russia locate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s support for Russia was part of a coordinated effort through which Trump engaged in pro-Russian advocacy in exchange for prohibited electoral or financial assistance\u2014something that is far from proven\u2014that could form the basis of an illegal conspiracy. The key to proving such a conspiracy would be to show that Trump and Russia formed a \u201cunity of purpose, or common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds\u201d\u2014the legal test for establishing the \u201cagreement\u201d prong of a conspiracy.\n\nThis task that Mueller now faces\u2014determining whether supposedly unilateral, lawful actions were actually the result of a covert agreement\u2014is the defining feature of an entire other area of the law: price-fixing conspiracies. For more than a century, antitrust prosecutors and litigators have similarly sought to prove the existence of secret collusion between rivals. The body of conspiracy law that has developed in the antitrust context is among the most robust in all of American jurisprudence and applies with similar force to non-antitrust conspiracies. It offers the best road map for evaluating the Russia investigation as it reaches its final stages.\n\nSo what does antitrust law teach us about allegations of Russian collusion? From what we know today, and contrary to partisan narratives, the applicable legal framework yields no clear outcomes for either side. It offers equal defenses to Trump as it does ammunition to Mueller.\n\nFirst, Mueller will not need to show direct evidence of a Trump-Russia agreement to prove a conspiracy. Because antitrust conspiracies, like a potential Trump-Russia conspiracy, are carried out by sophisticated actors adept at avoiding detection, courts have ruled that \u201cit is well recognized law that any conspiracy can ordinarily only be proved by inferences drawn from relevant and competent circumstantial evidence.\u201d Courts have explained that \u201c[b]y its nature conspiracy is conceived and carried out clandestinely, and direct evidence of the crime is rarely available.\u201d\n\nThe ability to prove a conspiracy without direct evidence of an agreement is not just theoretical.\n\nSecond, Mueller will not need to show that a \u201cformal agreement\u201d existed between Trump and Russia. Nor, according to precedent, must he show that Trump and Russia \u201cmet each other\u201d or \u201cstated in words or writing what the scheme was or how it was to be effected.\u201d All Mueller would need to show is that Trump and Russia \u201ctacitly came to a mutual understanding,\u201d something that can occur without personal communication or a clear quid pro quo. Courts have long recognized that a \u201cknowing wink can mean more than words\u201d and that a conspiracy can be proven through \u201ca course of dealing or other circumstances,\u201d just as it can through express communication.\n\nThe ability to prove a conspiracy without direct evidence of an agreement is not just theoretical. The government has successfully prosecuted antitrust conspiracies using circumstantial evidence in the past. In one example, competing lumber companies were convicted of conspiring to rig lumber purchases by agreeing in advance about which companies would bid on which sales. There was no direct evidence that the companies reached an agreement to coordinate their bids, but there was evidence showing that they met to discuss which sales each company found desirable and thereafter avoided competing on those sales. Despite the lack of direct evidence of an agreement, the trial court held there was sufficient evidence of an \u201cimplied agreement.\u201d The appellate court affirmed, finding that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the companies had reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d on bidding.\n\nThe types of circumstantial evidence from which juries may infer agreements from such conduct\u2014known in the antitrust world as \u201cplus factors\u201d\u2014overlap in part with what is publicly known about potential collusion with Russia. Plus factors arise when alleged co-conspirators (1) share motives to conspire; (2) had secret contacts with no legitimate purpose; (3) made suspicious changes in behavior following such contacts; and (4) sought to conceal their contacts through pretexts and false denials. Without direct evidence of an agreement, prosecutors will need to establish enough plus factors to eliminate any doubt that Trump and Russia reached an agreement.\n\nAt present, certain aspects of their case appear stronger than others.\n\nOne threshold showing that prosecutors could likely make is that Trump and Russia had motives to conspire. Trump was losing in the polls throughout the campaign, and his staff knew that Russia possessed something that could help swing the election in his favor: thousands of hacked emails supposedly implicating Hillary Clinton. Trump was also negotiating with the Kremlin over a potentially lucrative Trump Tower in Moscow, and his campaign manager was seeking to use his position to repay millions of dollars in debt to prominent Russians. Meanwhile, Russia was seeking relief from the Magnitsky Act sanctions supported by Trump\u2019s political opponents and derided Clinton for her vocal criticism of Russia. To prove a conspiracy, though, prosecutors must do more than merely show these motives existed; they must show Trump and Russia agreed to act on them.\n\nStronger, yet still inconclusive, evidence of an agreement lies in the numerous contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the campaign. The most famous contact was a June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Kremlin-connected Russians and Trump\u2019s top campaign staff. The meeting was organized by an intermediary who claimed that Russians could provide damaging information on Clinton as part of \u201cRussia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d Donald Trump Jr. responded that he \u201clove[d]\u201d the idea, one that echoed what a Kremlin-linked professor had told campaign adviser George Papadopoulos a month earlier about Russia possessing thousands of hacked Democratic emails. At the meeting, the Russians requested an end to the Magnitsky Act sanctions, and Trump Jr. indicated they would revisit the topic if Trump won the election. That same day, in what may or may not have been a coincidence, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen began arranging travel to St. Petersburg to meet with Putin\u2019s inner circle regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project. And just five days later, Russian military hackers began publicly releasing the first wave of stolen Democratic emails.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for Russia, meanwhile, continued as the campaign progressed. In July 2016, the Trump campaign reportedly intervened to prevent anti-Russia language from being included in the GOP platform after several meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Then, on the same day that Trump publicly encouraged Russia to locate more Clinton emails, Russians attempted for the first time to hack Clinton\u2019s personal email account. Throughout the fall, Trump associate Roger Stone was secretly communicating with Russian hackers and WikiLeaks about stolen Democratic emails. And after Trump won the election, his transition team sought to establish a secret back channel with Russia and covertly persuaded the Kremlin to avoid retaliating for sanctions imposed under the Obama administration. Antitrust law dictates that such changes in behavior support an inference of conspiracy when they follow defendants\u2019 secret contacts.\n\nIf presented at trial, the jury\u2019s task will be to determine whether this mutual assistance between Trump and Russia reflects mere parallel conduct (i.e., pursuing similar goals without coordination), which is not itself illegal\u2014or coordinated conduct, which is.\n\nThe key burden for the prosecution, as antitrust law dictates, will be to show that Trump and Russia did more than merely anticipate one another\u2019s interests and pursue them independently. Such \u201cconscious parallelism,\u201d as it is known in antitrust law, is not sufficient to show a conspiracy. This is because distinct actors can share and pursue the same goals without necessarily agreeing to do so.\n\nThis is where the prosecution\u2019s case shows signs of weakness. Absent additional evidence, Trump could plausibly argue that while he knew Russia was interfering in the election and seeking sanctions relief, his support for Russia did not stem from any arrangement, but rather from his own rational belief that supporting Putin might spur further election assistance. Problematic as this may be, it is not sufficient to establish a conspiracy.\n\nThis \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d defense, common in price-fixing cases, could be a successful defense for Trump. With what we know today, Russia and Trump\u2019s conduct can be rationally explained without concerted action. Russia has intervened in several foreign elections, and Trump began showing favoritism toward Russia long before his campaign began. It is possible this dynamic progressed during the campaign without any coordination between the two sides.\n\nTo overcome such a defense, prosecutors would need to show that Trump and Russia reached some semblance of an actual agreement, which the law defines flexibly as \u201ca unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds.\u201d Without direct evidence of an agreement, prosecutors\u2019 best argument will be that coincidence and parallel thinking alone could not have yielded the high degree of parallel conduct that Trump and Russia exhibited, particularly when their secret contacts provide a more rational explanation for their mutual support. Plaintiffs in civil antitrust conspiracy cases often make similar arguments with success.\n\nTrump and Russia\u2019s public statements could also provide circumstantial evidence of an agreement.\n\nCrucially for Trump, this argument will hold less sway in a criminal case, where prosecutors have the burden of proving an agreement beyond a reasonable doubt. If after all the evidence is presented, Trump can offer a plausible explanation for his conduct that does not involve an agreement with Russia, prosecutors will have failed to \u201cexclude the possibility\u201d that Trump and Russia acted independently, making a conviction unlikely. To avoid this, Mueller will need enough circumstantial evidence to eliminate any non-collusive explanations for Trump\u2019s conduct, including the possibility that Trump and Russia acted \u201cconsciously parallel.\u201d Doing so will require more evidence that what is publicly known today.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the present information is irrelevant to prosecutors. Trump and his associates\u2019 attempts to cover up their Russian contacts bolster the prosecution\u2019s case. Among other things, Trump repeatedly denied his campaign\u2019s extensive meetings and communications with Russians and personally dictated a misleading statement about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Antitrust law holds that such false denials raise an inference of conspiracy and tend to \u201cdisprove the likelihood of independent action.\u201d\n\nTrump and Russia\u2019s public statements could also provide circumstantial evidence of an agreement. It is no defense that Trump and Russia may have communicated through the media and public speeches rather than through covert channels. Antitrust law recognizes that such public \u201csignaling\u201d can also facilitate conspiracies because conspirators can use public means to reach agreement just as they can private ones.\n\nThose weighing the evidence should ultimately keep three things in mind. First, federal guidelines recommend bringing charges if admissible evidence will \u201cprobably\u201d be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction\u2014meaning if there is a greater than 50 percent chance of winning at trial. Second, the jury\u2019s duty is to consider evidence of a conspiracy \u201cas a whole,\u201d without \u201ctightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each.\u201d Third, if the redactions in Mueller\u2019s legal filings suggest anything, it is that there may be substantially more evidence implicating Trump than what has been publicly released to date, only a portion of which has been described here.\n\nWhether Mueller will ultimately bring conspiracy charges against Trump and his associates is a complicated calculus involving an unparalleled mix of evidentiary, political, and constitutional considerations. Antitrust law provides little guidance on how Mueller might proceed on those fronts. But anyone making assurances at this stage reveals more about their ignorance of the law than their knowledge of the case. The more insightful dialogue we should be having as we await Mueller\u2019s findings has less to do with the investigation\u2019s outcome than the legal principles shaping its path and how those principles apply to the still-developing body of evidence.\n\nOn this question, we may soon get a preview. Last year, the Democratic National Committee filed a civil lawsuit alleging a wide-ranging conspiracy between the Trump campaign, Russia, WikiLeaks, and others to use stolen DNC emails to assist Trump\u2019s candidacy. Substantive briefing in the case could begin later this year. While the DNC\u2019s case is narrower than Mueller\u2019s inquiry, the legal arguments raised in the civil case may foreshadow each side\u2019s arguments in a potential criminal one. The key inquiry in both cases will be the same: Is there sufficient evidence of an agreement between Trump and Russia to establish a conspiracy? No area of law is better equipped to answer this question than antitrust law. Expect it to figure prominently as both cases unfold.", "https://www.vox.com/2019/2/21/18233377/oakland-teachers-strike-2019": "Oakland teachers just kicked off the fourth major teachers strike of the year.\n\nOn Thursday, nearly all of the 2,300 public school teachers in the district refused to show up to work, rejecting the superintendent\u2019s latest offer of a 7 percent raise over three years.\n\nTeachers want much more than that, according to the Oakland Education Association, a teachers union that has been negotiating a new contract with school officials for more than 18 months. They want smaller class sizes, charter school oversight, and more school nurses and guidance counselors. They also want the district to keep two dozen schools open in low-income neighborhoods that the district plans to shutter.\n\nAnd they want a 12 percent raise, not 7 percent.\n\n\u201cA 7 percent raise in three years barely covers the cost of inflation,\u201d said Natalie Wendt, a 35-year-old special education teacher who has worked in the district for five years. \u201cIf people value teachers, the most basic level of respect we should get is to make enough money to live in the communities where we work, not get priced out.\u201d\n\nWendt told me she has \u201cdefinitely\u201d considered leaving Oakland, considering that she can\u2019t afford to buy a home or pay child care costs on her $55,000 salary. Instead, she lives in a rent-controlled apartment in nearby Berkeley, and her mother watches her 2-year-old son while she works.\n\nThe strike in Oakland comes less than a month after teachers in Los Angeles walked off the job with similar demands in January \u2014 and ended up getting a lot of what they wanted. At the time, LA officials said the same thing Oakland officials are now saying: We just don\u2019t have the money.\n\n\u201cWe have to live within our current financial reality,\u201d Kyla Johnson-Trammell, the Oakland schools superintendent, wrote in a column published Wednesday.\n\nOakland schools are facing a $56 million budget deficit in the next two years, so the school board wants to cut school spending, not increase it. Johnson-Trammell is urging state lawmakers to invest more money in public schools, but teachers are not waiting around for that to happen.\n\nThey woke up early Thursday morning and began picketing outside their schools at 6:30; they also plan to rally later in the afternoon in front of Oakland City Hall.\n\n\u201cBooks!

Lower class size!\u201d chanted one group of teachers outside of Skyline High School.\n\nBooks!\n\nSupplies!\n\nLower class size! \u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\n\nChants begin at a rally in front of Skyline High in Oakland with teachers and supporters the evening before the #OaklandTeacherStrike. #Unite4OaklandKids pic.twitter.com/3mylm4NEUJ \u2014 California Teachers Association (@WeAreCTA) February 20, 2019\n\nThe district is keeping schools open during the stoppage, and has hired hundreds of substitute teachers to replace those on strike.\n\nThe Oakland strike gives momentum to a national trend playing out in red and blue states across the country. More than 100,000 public school teachers in six states have walked out of class in the past year, rebelling from years of stagnant wages, crumbling infrastructure, and deep budget cuts to education.\n\nThe strikes in Arizona, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, California, and Colorado had broad public support, forcing state lawmakers to raise pay and fueling a national movement to boost investment in public education.\n\nSo far this year, the energy of the movement has only continued to build.\n\nFunding for public schools in California is a mess\n\nOakland teachers share a lot of the same frustrations that led LA teachers to walk out of class in January. They say school districts are spending too much money on privately run charter schools that have little public oversight. They also believe they are paid too little to work in a state that has so much wealth.\n\nCalifornia is among the states that spend the least on each student (adjusted for the cost of living), largely because of the state\u2019s strict limits on property tax rates.\n\nThe Oakland Education Association, a labor union representing 3,000 educators, has been trying to negotiate a new contract since the last one expired in 2017. Teachers want a 12 percent pay raise over three years, smaller classes, and more support staff. One school counselor for every 600 students is not conducive to a student\u2019s success, says Keith Brown, the group\u2019s president.\n\nThe district had offered a 5 percent raise over three years. Teachers rejected the offer.\n\n\u201cWe have had it. Enough is enough; bargaining with our school district has not worked,\u201d Brown, who is also a middle school teacher, said during a press conference on Saturday. \u201cOur schools have been starved of resources for years.\u201d\n\nThe union also rejected a 7 percent raise school officials proposed on Tuesday.\n\nTeachers say the lack of investment in city schools is hurting student performance. The cost of living in Oakland has also skyrocketed in recent years, due to an influx of high-skilled workers unable to afford housing across the bay in San Francisco.\n\nThe average one-bedroom apartment in Oakland costs about $2,680 per month, but new Oakland teachers earn about $46,500 a year. That\u2019s the main the reason Oakland has struggled to keep qualified teachers, Brown said, pointing out that 571 Oakland teachers left the classroom last year.\n\nThe school district has said it\u2019s willing to keep negotiating for a better deal to end the strike, and would consider some recommendations from an independent panel, which found that low teacher pay, large class sizes, and school privatization was hurting Oakland schools. The report also acknowledges the state\u2019s \u201ccomplicated, flawed\u201d system for funding public education.\n\n\u201cI am doing everything in my power as superintendent to move us toward a solution that works for educators and for the fiscal vitality of our entire district,\u201d Johnson-Trammell, the superintendent, wrote on Wednesday.\n\nUntil they reach a deal, teachers are going without pay while they are on strike, which will put a financial strain on many of them, said Wendt, the special ed teacher I spoke to. But she says they don\u2019t really have any other option.\n\n\u201cWe all really want children to get the best education possible, and a huge part of that is that we can\u2019t retain quality teachers because we can\u2019t even pay them enough to live in Oakland,\u201d she told me.\n\nThe outcome of the six-day LA teachers strike in January, which resulted in pay raises for teachers and more funding for schools, gives Wendt hope that Oakland teachers can reach a similar deal too.\n\nThe success of recent teachers strikes across the country suggests there\u2019s a good chance they will succeed.\n\nTeachers are leading a national workers\u2019 revolt\n\nA record number of US workers went on strike or stopped working in 2018 because of labor disputes with employers, according to new data released last week by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. A total of 485,000 employees were involved in major work stoppages last year \u2014 the highest number since 1986, when flight attendants, garbage collectors, and steelworkers walked off the job.\n\nFrustrated public school teachers were behind the year\u2019s largest walkouts, but hotel housekeepers and steelworkers also organized strikes that lasted for days.\n\nThere are no signs that worker angst has subsided. So far, in 2019, teachers in three major cities have gone on strike, including Oakland, and nearly all of West Virginia\u2019s teachers did too. The Los Angeles teachers strike shut down the nation\u2019s second-largest school district for more than a week in January.\n\nAs part of their deal with city officials, teachers agreed to a 6 percent raise and slightly fewer students in each classroom, according to Alex Caputo-Pearl, the president of United Teachers Los Angeles, a labor union that represents about 34,000 public school teachers, nurses, librarians, and support staff in the city.\n\nLast week, more than 2,000 teachers in Denver went on strike for three days. The school district ended up giving educators an extra $23 million in pay and agreed to overhaul the compensation system, which relied heavily on annual bonuses.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 19,000 teachers walked off the job in West Virginia, closing down nearly every school in the state for the second time in a year. But this time around, teachers were not fighting for pay raises. They\u2019re protesting Republican efforts to privatize public education.\n\nBy the end of the day on Tuesday, West Virginia lawmakers had agreed to put those plans on hold.\n\nNow Oakland teachers have walked out, and Sacramento teachers may follow.", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-mother-arrested-posting-video-high-school-fight-social-media-n974146": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Brockler wanted to let his client, David Chislton, know he would try to get the time reduced.\n\nNext thing Brockler knew, he told The Washington Post, he was on his back, under a courtroom table and beneath Chislton, who was biting him.\n\nChislton punched Brockler in the face shortly after the judge issued her ruling, according to Brockler\u2019s account, a police report and body camera footage of the incident.\n\n\u201cHe was hoping to get under 20 years,\u201d Brockler said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think, when the judge said 47, he just snapped and I was the closest person to him and he let it out on me.\u201d\n\nThe collision sent Brockler sprawling and left him with an injured hip, a broken nose and a concussion, he said.\n\n\u201cHe definitely knocked me out,\u201d said Brockler, who used to play ice hockey. \u201cIt took me back to my hockey days. It was just like getting hit in the head with a slap shot.\u201d\n\nThe Cuyahoga County Sheriff\u2019s Office charged Chislton with felonious assault for the courtroom incident, which the department\u2019s spokesman told The Post was unprecedented in his time there.\n\n\u201cI have been here 12 years and have not seen anything similar,\u201d said Officer John O\u2019Brien.\n\nChislton was in court that day to receive a sentence stemming from a 2017 standoff with police, in which Chislton reportedly assaulted his girlfriend, who accused him of sexually abusing a teenage girl, and set his apartment complex on fire.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to domestic violence and multiple counts of felonious assault and aggravated arson, court records show.\n\nChislton knew he was looking at substantial prison time, Brockler said. Brockler was Chislton\u2019s third lawyer on the case, he said, after Chislton clashed with the first two. Chislton appreciated Brockler\u2019s help, the lawyer said.

Brockler said Chislton was handcuffed from the front, with full range of motion available. That was the \u201ckey mistake,\u201d Brockler said.\n\nThe department did not respond to a request for comment about Chislton\u2019s restraints, but a statement from the court\u2019s top judge alluded to courthouse safety protocols.\n\n\u201cThis incident is a reminder that the safety of our employees, citizens and anyone else in our courtrooms should be a top priority,\u201d said Judge John J.

They include general guidelines for addressing the crisis.\n\nAmong the proposals:\n\nEstablishing protocols for handling accusations against bishops.\n\nHaving candidates for priesthood undergo psychological evaluations.\n\nFormulating mandatory codes of conduct for clerics and volunteers outlining \"appropriate boundaries in personal relationships.\"\n\nEstablishing a group with a \"certain autonomy\" from the church easily accessible to victims who want to report a crime.\n\nThe pope exhorted the bishops and religious superiors in attendance to \"listen to the cry of the young seeking justice.\"\n\nFive anonymous abuse survivors addressed the gathering via video.\n\nA woman from Africa relayed her experience of being raped by a priest, beginning at the age of 15.\n\n\"I got pregnant three times, and he made me have abortions three times.\" She added that her life had been \"destroyed.\"\n\nAnother survivor from Chile said the church's leaders had discredited victims and protected the priests who abused them.\n\n\"You are the physicians of the soul and yet, with rare exceptions, you have been transformed, in some cases, into murderers of the soul, into murderers of the faith,\" he said.\n\nPhilippine Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle choked up when he told the gathering that \"wounds have been inflicted by us, the bishops, on the victims. ...

Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of a Chilean predator priest, was among those calling for zero tolerance by the church.\n\n\"Raping a child has been a crime in the first century, in the Middle Ages, and now and it will be in future,\" he said. \"I don't find any excuse to not change radically, because the church is on borrowed time right now.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gregorio Borgia/AP Gregorio Borgia/AP\n\nVatican officials have historically justified the absence of universal rules and mandatory reporting to civil authorities, saying accused clergy could be unfairly persecuted in authoritarian states where Catholics are a threatened minority.\n\nThe summit continues through the weekend and will close with another speech by the pope.", "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/bernie-sanders-venezuela-maduro-1179636": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Many Venezuelans have flocked to the state as the country\u2019s economy crashed and repression increased.\n\nDemocrats, already alarmed that Trump\u2019s inroads with Venezuelans could help him peel off an otherwise-reliable Democratic voting bloc in a toss-up state, were quick to denounce Sanders\u2019 comments.\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles and, told POLITICO. \u201cI absolutely disagree with his imprecision in not saying Maduro must go.\u201d Shalala has filed legislation aimed at helping Venezuelan immigrants.\n\nThe emerging issue hasn\u2019t yet spilled into the broader Democratic primary for president. Most candidates haven\u2019t weighed in, some by choice.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Vice President Joe Biden, however, have clearly stated they consider Maduro a dictator and Guaid\u00f3 the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Pod Save America that she believed Maduro was a dictator and suggested she supported the \u201cdiplomatic part\u201d of Trump\u2019s backing of Guaid\u00f3, though she faulted him for too much \u201csaber rattling.\u201d\n\nOne Democratic Hispanic consultant said the remarks will cause a needless \u201cfrenzy\u201d in South Florida\u2019s Hispanic community.\n\nSanders did not embrace Maduro in his Tuesday interview with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, who quickly touched on Guaid\u00f3 being declared the interim president of Venezuela by the nation\u2019s National Assembly following Maduro\u2019s questionable election.\n\nBut when he was asked whether he recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader of the country, Sanders answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\"There are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election,\" Sanders added.\n\nIn a follow-up question, Ramos asked Sanders if he thought Maduro is a dictator who should step down. Sanders refused to say yes or no.\n\n\"I think clearly he has been very, very abusive,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cThat is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there's got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America, as you recall, whether it was Chile or Brazil or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.\u201d\n\nSanders also said that he believes \u201cthe United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThat comment puzzled Shalala. \u201cI do agree the international comm needs to come together and the U.S. needs to work with the international community,\" she said. \"But that\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n\nAfter Shalala posted her disagreement with Sanders on Twitter, the Vermont senator\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Ari Rabin-Havt, replied to her that \u201cthis view represents the long and horrific history of American politicians imposing their will on the people of Latin America. Bernie stands with the Venezuelan people to demand free and fair elections and for self-determination for all people around the world.\u201d\n\nRabin-Havt also noted Sanders has condemned Maduro.\n\nThe United States was the first to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s leader last month. About 64 other nations have followed. However, the United Nations still recognizes Maduro, though it has called for talks, as roughly 50 countries side with him \u2014 including U.S. foes Cuba, China, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia and Syria.\n\nSanders has long had sympathy for leftist governments. Once a self-described socialist \u2014 he now uses the term \"democratic socialist\" \u2014 Sanders has spoken favorably in the past about socialist and communist strongmen. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Sanders once said, wasn't \"perfect\" but \"totally transformed\" the country. And Nicaragua\u2019s leftist leader, Daniel Ortega, was \"an impressive guy,\" Sanders argued.\n\nOver the decades, Miami has become a home for exiles from some of those leftist governments, with Cuban-Americans leading the way and leaning strongly Republican. Venezuelans and Nicaraguans tend to vote Democratic once they become U.S. citizens and register to vote in Florida.\n\nBut Democratic consultants and community leaders say there\u2019s evidence that could change and that the GOP\u2019s anti-socialist messaging helped Republicans in 2018 and could help Trump in 2020.\n\nHelena Poleo, a Democrat who\u2019s a former journalist from Venezuela and is a Spanish-language commentator, called Sanders comments \u201cdisgusting. The Florida Democratic Party needs to denounce this now.\u201d\n\nThe state party made its position on Maduro clear, without mentioning Sanders by name.\n\n\u201cFlorida Democrats have been unequivocal: We recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the President of Venezuela, denounce the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and his efforts to remain illegally in power,\" the party said in a statement. Its comments echoed those of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who represents one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the United States.\n\nState Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Miami Democrat, said she was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d and believed Sanders wasn\u2019t properly briefed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously clueless,\u201d Taddeo said.\n\n\u201cSeems the Senator has already written Florida off his presidential campaign strategy,\u201d deadpanned Ric Herrero with the Cuba Study Group, which advocates for more engagement with Havana, an incidental ally of Caracas.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s top Democratic consultants for Hispanic outreach, former state party political director Christian Ulvert, said he was disappointed with Sanders for making such \u201cextremely ignorant\u201d comments. Ulvert, who\u2019s of Nicaraguan descent, said he found Sanders\u2019 comments harmful on a personal level as did his husband, who\u2019s from Venezuela and has relatives suffering under Maduro.\n\nThe day before Sanders\u2019 comments aired on Al Punto, Ulvert had written to the Democratic National Committee chairman concerning the location of the party\u2019s 2020 presidential convention and noted that Trump was trying to make inroads based on his anti-socialism message. Ulvert said \u201ceveryone in our party from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Joe Biden have recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the acting leader of Venezuela and said Maduro must go,\u201d and now Sanders is complicating that message.\n\n\u201cThis helps Trump and it makes our job harder as Democrats,\u201d Ulvert said. \u201cWhat this will do is whip into a frenzy South Florida\u2019s Hispanic community on both sides of the aisle.

That is emerging as the EU\u2019s current plan.\n\nThe EU sees this as a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d to give British Parliament time to pass necessary legislation related to its departure from the bloc.

However, with just five weeks to go until the U.K.\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU and talks at an impasse, ministers and lawmakers in her own party are threatening to vote against her next week to give Parliament control of the process.\n\nThe Backstop, Temporarily\n\nThe prime minister has repeatedly spoken out against a delay, saying she wants to take the U.K. out of the EU as scheduled at the end of March. She\u2019s never completely ruled it out, however. Any postponement would have to be requested by the U.K. and accepted by all the remaining 27 EU governments.\n\nEU officials say the three-month extension would happen under their most optimistic scenario. The risk remains that the U.K. could leave the bloc March 29 without a deal.

MDLZ, +0.88% in 2012. Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015 in a deal backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.40% , which dipped 0.6% in extended trading Thursday. Kraft Heinz ended Thursday\u2019s regular trading session with a market capitalization of nearly $59 billion, suggesting the company\u2019s valuation could be chopped by more than $10 billion if losses hold into Friday\u2019s trading session.\n\nIn its earnings report Thursday, Kraft Heinz revealed a multitude of concerns:\n\n\u2022 Fourth-quarter results came in much lighter than expected. On an adjusted basis, the company claimed earnings of 84 cents a share, down from 90 cents a share and lower than the average analyst estimate of 94 cents a share. Revenue rose to $6.89 billion from $6.84 billion, but still came in below the consensus estimate of $6.94 billion, according to FactSet.\n\n\u2022 Without adjustments, that bottom line looks much worse. Kraft Heinz reported quarterly losses of $12.61 billion, or $10.34 a share, thanks to a write-down of more than $15 billion related to a declining valuation of several of its businesses, most notably the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks.\n\n\u2022 The company slashed its dividend by more than a third, to a quarterly rate of 40 cents a share from 62.5 cents a share.\n\n\u2022 Oh, there is also an investigation into Kraft Heinz\u2019s accounting that resulted in a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company disclosed in its announcement.\n\nExecutives did not say that the problems would be solved in 2019, either. In fact, they pointed toward 2020 while predicting an adjusted Ebitda profit total of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year, down from $7.08 billion in 2018 and well lower than the average analyst estimate of $7.5 billion, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities,\u201d Chief Financial Officer David Knopf said in a conference call Thursday afternoon.\n\nKraft Heinz did not offer any more specific numbers for its 2019 forecast, as is typical for the company. The Ebitda forecast was out of character for a company that typically does not provide specific guidance.\n\nKnopf also revealed that the company is evaluating the sale of unnamed businesses this year to pay down debt. Kraft Heinz has already announced two planneddivestitures, and said proceeds from those sales would also go toward restructuring the debt load.\n\nKnopf also further addressed the SEC investigation in Thursday\u2019s conference call.\n\n\u201cThe company was notified by the SEC regarding an investigation into the company\u2019s procurement area. Following this, we conducted a very thorough internal investigation with the support of an independent law firm and accounting firm, and we determined that we should\u2019ve reported $25 million in prior periods which we booked in Q4 2018,\u201d Knopf said. \u201dTo put it into context how that compares, overall procurement was over $11 billion, which excludes Big Four commodity spend. So this misstatement was not material to our current or prior year financial statements, and finally, we did implement several improvements to internal controls and took remedial measures to mitigate the likelihood that this happens again.\u201d\n\nEven before any post-earnings decline, Kraft Heinz shares have fallen 28.6% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.35% has gained 2.7%.", "https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2019/02/21/ford-stock-drops-amid-news-gas-mileage-inquiry/2944609002/": "Ford Motor Co. saw its stock drop Thursday in after-hours trading after the company revealed an internal investigation into whether its vehicles have worse gas mileage and emit more pollutants than car, truck and SUV labels reveal \u2014 going back to 2017 models.\n\nAn anonymous \u201cSpeak Up\u201d reporting system at Ford raised the issue in September 2018, the company said.\n\nThe next generation of Ford's Ranger midsize pickup will probably form the basis for a pickup Volkswagen will sell in South America, Africa and Europe. (Photo11: Mark Phelan)\n\nFord said Thursday it had hired an outside team to evaluate whether Ford\u2019s mathematical model was flawed in how it determined miles per gallon and emissions ratings.\n\nTo begin the review, Ford said, it will start testing the wildly popular new 2019 Ranger midsize pickup, which just went on sale. And then other models would be tested.\n\nThe Ranger was recalled on Feb. 6 for faulty wiring that can prevent the pickup from shifting properly and parking safely.\n\nFord officials emphasized that the fuel and emissions ratings inquiry is in its preliminary stages and nothing points to a problem at this time.\n\nA Ford spokesman declined to say how many vehicles might be affected for model years 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\nFord spokesman Said Deep said: \"Soon as we learned of our employee concerns in September we engaged a third party firm at the end of October to perform initial review which ended in December. We began a full internal investigation in December leading to this weeks voluntary disclosure about our investigation to the EPA and CARB. we estimate the full investigation will take several more months.\"\n\nFord said in its Thursday news release that the company alerted California regulators, who are exceptionally strict about pollution oversight in one of the biggest car markets in the world.\n\nBut Dave Clegern, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, told the Free Press later Thursday that \u201cas of this moment, CARB has not received notification of the mileage issue from Ford.\u201d\n\nFord stock dipped in after hours trading after the company made its disclosure involving the certification process.\n\nMore: FCA has to pay some Jeep, Ram owners about $3,000\n\nMore: Auto supplier fined millions in U.S. diesel emissions fraud\n\nMore: Why California is fighting for tough vehicle emissions standards\n\nMichael Abboud, EPA spokesman, confirmed with the Free Press that Ford reached out a few days before releasing the public statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cOn Feb. 18, 2019, Ford disclosed to the US EPA that it had discovered potential issues in its emissions certification processes,\u201d Abboud said. \u201cOn Feb. 20, 2019, Ford briefed the agency on the information it has developed so far in the investigation. The investigation is ongoing and the information too incomplete for EPA to reach any conclusions. We take the potential issues seriously and are following up with the company to fully understand the circumstances behind this disclosure.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday, Safe Climate Campaign, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club released a statement through the Sierra Club:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful that Ford waited months to disclose issues with its emissions testing.\"\n\nKarl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, praised Ford for being proactive and informing the public.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really smart for Ford to get in front of this circumstance,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly they discovered something that may suggest an inaccuracy in how they\u2019re defining and determining their fuel economy for their cars. They started to dig into it and wanted to get a handle on the issue before they said anything. Now they\u2019re letting everybody know.\u201d\n\nFord deserves recognition for having a program that allows tips for potential problems, Brauer said.\n\nKim Pittel, group vice president for sustainability, environment and safety engineering at Ford, said in a prepared statement: \u201cIn September, a handful of employees raised a concern through our Speak Up employee reporting channel regarding the analytical modeling that is part of our U.S. fuel economy and emissions compliance process.\"\n\nFord officials said they believe trust in the brand \"is earned by acting with integrity and transparency.\"\n\nPittel outlined actions to include:\n\nHiring an outside firm to conduct an investigation into the vehicle road load specifications used in testing and applications to certify emissions and fuel economy. Road load is a vehicle-specific resistance level used in vehicle dynamometer testing, including for fuel economy ratings and emissions certifications. Road load is established through engineering models that are validated through vehicle testing, including physical track tests referred to as coastdown testing.\n\nHiring independent industry technical experts as part of Ford's investigation team.\n\nHiring an independent lab to conduct further coastdown testing.\n\nEvaluating potential changes to Ford's road-load modeling process, including engineering, technical and governance components.\n\nVoluntarily sharing this week potential concerns with Environmental Protection Agency and California (California) Air Resources Board officials.\n\n\u201cAt this time, there\u2019s been no determination that this affects Ford\u2019s fuel economy labels or emissions certifications,\u201d Pittel said. \u201cWe plan to work with regulators and the independent lab to complete a technical review. As part of our review, we have identified potential concerns with how we calculate road load. The first vehicle we are evaluating is the 2019 Ranger; we are assessing additional vehicles as well.\u201d\n\nLabeling issues in 2014\n\nThis latest labeling issue is not the first for Ford, which sent checks to 215,000 Ford and Lincoln owners in June 2014 after they purchased vehicles with inaccurate fuel economy ratings. Models included the 2014 Ford Fiesta as well as hybrid version of the 2013-14 Ford Fusion, C-Max and Lincoln MKZ and the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid.\n\nAt that time, ratings were off by 1 to 7 m.p.g. Reimbursement depended on whether the vehicles were leased or purchased. Checks varied from $124 for a leased Fiesta to $1,050 for a purchased Lincoln MKZ.\n\nRaj Nair, then-head of Ford\u2019s global product development, said a discrepancy in testing was detected in October 2013 and subsequent testing traced the problem to a new process for correlating wind tunnel results. Those figures are used to determine the resistance level set on the dynamometer that tests vehicle mileage.\n\nAfter the incident, Ford agreed to enhanced validation tests for future vehicles under EPA oversight to prevent the error from occurring again.\n\nNews reports in 2014 noted that it was the second time in a year that Ford had to lower mileage figures on some models. In 2013, Ford voluntarily lowered its claim for the C-Max hybrid from 47 to 43 m.p.g. after Ford tested the Fusion hybrid and applied the same numbers to the other vehicle.\n\n2019 FCA emissions settlement\n\nAccurate labeling has been an issue for other automakers, too.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles settled a case with the U.S. Justice Department in January 2019 in response to diesel emissions irregularities and allegedly hiding attempts to deceive regulators. As a result, affected vehicle owners received cash payments of more than $3,000 each.\n\nIncluding about $400 million in civil penalties, an extended warranty, a proposed class-action legal settlement and other costs, FCA is expected to spend more than $790 million to resolve cheating allegations involving approximately 100,000 2014-16 Eco-diesel Ram 1500 pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees.\n\nWhile FCA declined to admit wrongdoing, Volkswagen confessed to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests. Both companies were accused of installing software known as \"defeat devices,\" which allowed vehicles to pollute more on roads than during testing.\n\nFord explicitly noted Thursday that no defeat devices were used.\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: phoward@freepress.com or 313-222-6512.Follow her on Twitter @phoebesaid\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2019/02/21/ford-stock-drops-amid-news-gas-mileage-inquiry/2944609002/", "https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696597381/apple-and-goldman-sachs-will-reportedly-launch-an-iphone-connected-credit-card": "Apple And Goldman Sachs Will Reportedly Launch An iPhone-Connected Credit Card\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nApple will reportedly have a different kind of product launch later this year: a credit card, jointly operated by Goldman Sachs.\n\nAccording to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the card will be integrated with the iPhone and offer features to track spending and points. The card would represent a move into new, highly competitive terrain for both companies.\n\nRather than competing with other credit cards offering lots of points, the Apple and Goldman Sachs card may try to attract users with features that emphasize budget management. \"Executives have discussed borrowing visual cues from Apple's fitness-tracking app, where 'rings' close as users hit daily exercise targets, and sending users notifications about their spending habits,\" the Journal reports.\n\nApple's move to get a share of the credit card market would be amid a slide in iPhone sales, particularly in China. Last month, the technology company said that its iPhone revenue declined 15 percent from the previous year.\n\nBut its services business has been growing. In its most recent earnings report, Apple trumpeted that services revenue hit $10.9 billion, an all-time high. That includes revenue from the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay \u2014 although as the Journal notes, Apple Pay \"has been slow to catch on among users and merchants.\"\n\nThat's where the credit card business comes in. Apple may be able to take a larger cut from purchases made on the credit card than it does through Apple Pay, while continuing to expand its role in the lives of iPhone users.\n\nFor Goldman, the card appears to be part of its effort to capture new customers: the middle class. In 2016, the bank launched Marcus, its business offering personal loans and online savings accounts.\n\nNeither Apple nor Goldman Sachs replied to NPR's request for comment.\n\nThe card will use the MasterCard payment network, the Journal reports.", "https://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-fold-outdoes-iphone-xs-heres-why-you-still-wont-buy-one/": "James Martin/CNET\n\nFoldable smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy Fold point to a bright future for the mobile world. But that doesn't mean you should hop on the bandwagon now.\n\nSamsung finally offered a longer, closer look at the Galaxy Fold, a smartphone that unfolds like a book to reveal a second, larger display. It's the stuff of sci-fi magic, and it opens the door to a whole new world of different designs and devices. Most notably, it leaves Apple's iPhone franchise, which hasn't had a major facelift in more than a year, in the dust.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Samsung flaunts Galaxy Fold at Unpacked\n\nThe Galaxy Fold may be impressive, but there might not be a more perfect illustration of the hazards of being an early adopter. Credit goes to Samsung for getting a foldable phone to market before rivals, but it's clear from our short first look at the device that a lot more polish and development needs to happen before this is ready for the average consumer. After all, the gadget was actually show on stage for a few minutes and wasn't available for demos despite Unpacked being the phone's launch event.\n\n\"The Galaxy Fold is not intended to be a mass-market product, at least not yet,\" said Avi Greengart, an analyst at Techsponential. \"It's a halo product for Samsung, aimed at early adopters.\"\n\nIndeed, hard-core Samsung and gadget enthusiasts will gladly line up to be the first to own this device. They'll be beta testers in this brand-new foldable adventure.\n\nSamsung knows this, which is why its safer Galaxy S10 line, alongside a Plus, 5G and budget variants, served as the meat of the Unpacked event. For most consumers, these devices will be more than sufficient for their needs.\n\nBut if you're thinking about the Galaxy Fold, here are a few reasons why you should reconsider.\n\nPrice\n\nYou think the $1,099 starting price of the iPhone XS Max is expensive? The Galaxy Fold will launch on April 26 at a staggering $1,980.\n\nNext to the Fold, the $899 Galaxy S10 and the bigger $999 Galaxy S10 Plus are practically bargains. Though they're decidedly more rigid.\n\nAt a time when prices for smartphones are higher than ever, the Galaxy Fold breaks new ground in terms of its potential to eat into your wallet.\n\nJustin Denison, marketing executive for Samsung, put it best: \"It's a one of a kind luxury device.\"\n\nUser interface\n\nSamsung has said it had to rethink the software and user interface to take advantage of the two displays. It's admirable the company took care in considering the new design, but Samsung has a mixed record when it comes to software.\n\nCNET\n\nThe early days of Touch Wiz were abysmal, and though the Samsung experience has come a long way, it still lacks the cleaner interfaces found on rival devices like Google's Pixel phones or OnePlus devices.\n\nWhat Samsung showed off Wednesday looked promising. The device will be able to run three apps at once, and the seamless flow between the smaller display and the larger one works well in the demos. But we won't know for sure till we get our hands on the gadget.\n\nGiven how niche this device will be, app support should be abysmal at first. Google said it would support foldable devices with its next Android update, but that won't come until the second half of the year. For now Samsung touted Google Maps and video from Netflix as examples of apps that'll take advantage of the larger screen.\n\nBattery\n\nWe won't know just how long the Galaxy Fold's battery lasts until we run proper tests, but the demands of not one, but two displays -- including a massive folding one -- don't bode well for the Galaxy Fold.\n\nSamsung seems to know this, and it touted the inclusion of two separate batteries running the device.\n\nSize\n\nThe downside of a foldable phone is, well, it folds. Two halves mean a device that's going to be thicker than even the bulkiest of smartphones. That comes at a time when phone makers are shaving millimeters off their devices and talking about sleek design.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold appears to be less bulky than the prototype Samsung showed off in November, but it's still easily twice as thick as your standard phone.\n\nSo just wait till you try to stuff it in the side pocket of your skinny jeans.\n\nJuan Garzon/CNET\n\nDurability\n\nThis one is the real x-factor. Samsung touted the proprietary articulated spine, as well as the coating on the glass that protects the foldable part from wear-and-tear damage. But even if Samsung has tested these phones, it's unclear just how durable they are.\n\nAlso, good luck dealing with the device if you've scratched or cracked the screen. You're not going to be able to bring this to any screen repair shop to get it fixed.\n\nCNET\n\nTo the foldable pioneers\n\nIf you're the type of person who needs to have the latest and greatest no matter what -- well, why are you even reading this story? Concerns like price and battery life probably aren't too critical, since this isn't likely your only phone.\n\n\"It will sell out and become a status symbol,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insight.\n\nSo, to those early adopters willing to brave the new world of foldable phones, eventually leading to more-polished products for the rest of us, I salute you.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick to my boring rectangular slab of glass and metal.\n\nThis story originally ran at 5 a.m. PT.", "https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804": "Photo: ArenaNet\n\nArenaNet, the studio behind the popular online games Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, informed employees today that it is planning big layoffs, according to a person who is there.

In order for a beneficiary to receive an inheritance, it has to be a physical person or a foundation,\" said Valerie Duane-Dray, an international inheritance lawyer based in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nShe suspects Lagerfeld took one of three routes to ensure Choupette, which means \"Sweetheart\" in English, would continue to be pampered after the designer's death.\n\nHe could have created a foundation, whose sole mission is to take care of the cat, and named a director who could receive funds under the condition that the money is for the animal's care.\n\nHe could also have donated the money to an existing nonprofit and stipulated that the funds be used to take care of Choupette. Alternatively, he could have left Choupette to a trusted individual along with a gift of cash, earmarked for her care, Duane-Dray said.\n\nIt's not uncommon for pet owners to consider their furry friends in estate planning. \"I have definitely recommended people taking certain steps planning for how their assets pass to make sure they take care of their pets,\" said certified financial planner Roger Ma.\n\nEstate laws in the U.S. vary but always require that a human being have oversight over any funds entrusted to a pet. Courts have discretion, too. \"There are reasonable limits to what you can leave a pet. A court will not honor the request of millions of dollars and can reduce a trust for a pet to what is a reasonable sum,\" said estate planning lawyer Jennifer Guimond-Quigley.\n\nStill, it isn't unheard of for an owner to bequeath a pet money it can't even spend.\n\nBillionaire real estate tycoon Leona Helmsely raised eyebrows in 2007 when she died and left $12 million for her Maltese, named Trouble.

According to Netflix, the film was given a production scale rarely seen in Chinese films and included post-production and special effects work that took two years. That included more than 10,000 specifically-built props and the employment of some 2,000 special effects shots, in addition to a \u201csubstantial amount of computer graphics shots.\u201d\n\n\u201cAudiences from over 190 countries will soon meet The Wandering Earth on Netflix,\u201d the film\u2019s director Frant Gwo said in a statement about the news, also raving about Netflix\u2019s plan to translate it into 28 languages. \u201cI am glad that our movie can reach to people from different parts of the world.

But questions remain whether the impact alone drove the dinosaurs to extinction or if it merely finished the job started by a massive volcanic outburst happening in India.\n\nThe Deccan Traps cover an area of roughly a half-million square kilometers, and the eruptions that created them involved over a million cubic kilometers of rock. Immense eruptions like this have been blamed for mass extinctions in the past, as they pump lots of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere and cause a rapid seesaw of cooling and warming. And the Deccan Traps are no exception: people have argued that they were already killing the dinosaurs or had stressed ecosystems in a way that set the stage for a mass extinction. But not everyone has bought in to this idea, and some have suggested that the asteroid collision actually drove changes in the Deccan Traps eruptions.\n\nSorting all this out requires a better sense of the timing of the eruptions vs. when the impact and extinctions occurred. In today's issue of Science, two papers attempt to narrow down the timing. Unfortunately, their results don't entirely agree.\n\nWhat and when?\n\nBoth papers rely on radiometric dating, but the papers use different types, each with their own limitations. One of them looks at the decay of uranium that's trapped in zircons that form during volcanic activity. The strength of this method is that it's very precise. Its downside is that zircons form at high temperatures, which means the zircons are underground prior to eruptions rather than during the eruption itself. So they don't provide a precise date of the eruption.\n\nTo get around this issue, an Indian-Swiss-US team looked at huge amounts of zircons and linked their dates to their specific location in the series of eruptions that built the Deccan Traps. A statistical analysis then identified any outliers\u2014a younger zircon beneath an older layer, for example\u2014and took them into account to build a model of the most probable ages of different eruptions.\n\nThis suggested that the Deccan traps were built in pulses, with a large eruption occurring about 100,000 years before the asteroid impact. An even larger one took place almost immediately after.\n\nA second team, this one from India-UK-US, did argon dating. The gas only starts being trapped once a rock solidifies, so it essentially starts the timer during the eruption itself. The hassle is that the gas can sometimes escape from the rock slowly over time, which is less of a problem with zircons.\n\nOverall, this group finds a big picture that overlaps with that of the group that did zircon dating. But there are differences in the details, and some of them are significant. For example, the researchers also find that the Deccan Trap eruptions overlapped with the mass extinction, occurring both before and after the event. But they see no evidence of pulses; instead, they see nearly continuous eruptions. Most of the material (~75 percent), they argue, was put in place after the mass extinction, though.\n\nThe researchers' dates are also consistent with a major shift in the properties of the erupted rock occurring at the same time as the impact. This supports the idea that the impact's seismic effects reached across the entire planet.\n\nEruptions like this release massive quantities of sulfur and carbon dioxide. These have opposing effects. The sulfur forms aerosols that reflect a huge amount of sunlight, causing a cooling. That cooling, however, is short term, as the aerosols don't have a long lifetime in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide does, and it produces a follow-on warming through the greenhouse effect. This climate seesaw is thought to have contributed to some mass extinctions.\n\nThe second paper includes an analysis that correlates the eruptions with signs of the climate change, but it finds they don't line up well. The authors conclude that either something else was going on with the climate, or the release of gasses doesn't always line up with the volume of lava erupted. So that result raises questions about how much the Deccan eruptions would have contributed to ecological disruptions.\n\nOverall, it seems that we have a lot more information, but it isn't necessarily leading to a clearer picture. The results do confirm that significant eruptions were happening before the mass extinction, but the biggest of them seemed to be happening after, and the eruptions' effect on distant ecosystems is unclear. And we don't know whether the eruptions were a small series of enormous outbursts or a relatively steady drumbeat of smaller events.\n\nThe good news is that if you're a fan of dinosaurs and want to know how they met their end, there's still science to be done.\n\nScience, 2019.

Materially, everything is the best it\u2019s ever been\u2014we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked\u2014the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn\u2019t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it\u2019s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn\u2019t\u2014and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the \u201csubtle art\u201d of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.\n\nNow, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom\u2014and even of hope itself.\n\nWith his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven\u2019t considered before. It\u2019s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul.

Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way that we\u2019re wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we fu*k ourselves over: We can\u2019t save money. We land in the same type of toxic relationship. We\u2019re stuck in a rut at work.
