{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rod-rosenstein-doj-resignation_n_5c6b6aa8e4b0b9cc78ffa6b2": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein plans to leave the Department of Justice next month following a chaotic tenure that saw him bear the brunt of President Donald Trump\u2019s rage over the ongoing inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBoth Reuters and CNN reported Monday that Rosenstein, a career prosecutor, would step down sometime in mid-March, citing a senior Justice Department official.

Experts said in July 2017 that the Pyongyang had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States,\u201d McCabe said during the interview. \u201cAnd he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIntelligence officials in the briefing responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses to which the president replied, \u2018I don\u2019t care.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-kentucky-school-border_n_5c69ef82e4b01757c36ca404": "Sen.

After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfill his signature campaign pledge, Trump\u2019s declared national emergency Friday shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that his state would sue \u201cimminently\u201d to block the order, after the American Civil Liberties Union and the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen announced Friday they were taking legal action.\n\nDemocrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump \u2014 though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.\n\nThe White House\u2019s Miller insisted that Congress granted the president wide berth under the National Emergencies Act to take action. But Trump\u2019s declaration goes beyond previous emergencies in shifting money after Congress blocked his funding request for the wall, which will likely factor in legal challenges.\n\nTrump aides acknowledge that Trump cannot meet his pledge to build the wall by the time voters decide whether to grant him another term next year, but insist his base will remain by his side as long as he is not perceived to have given up the fight on the barrier.\n\nSen.

At the same time, the president\u2019s daily dishonesties, repeated insults of large segments of the electorate and likely collusion with a foreign power to win his election may have poisoned his adopted party\u2019s brand for many elections to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a demographic death spiral,\u201d said Republican consultant John Weaver, a top aide to former Ohio GOP Gov. John Kasich. \u201cIf we were Coca-Cola or Delta or any product on the market, would you be happy that your customers, your base of support, were old, white and closed-minded?\u201d\n\nTrump had little to do with the Republican Party before entering its presidential primary nearly four years ago. He was not a major donor. He had never run for so much as a local committeeman post. He was never a campaign surrogate or ever considered for a presidential appointment in previous administrations.\n\nNevertheless, with a combination of blatantly race-based appeals to a key segment of the GOP base and boasts that his business \u201csavvy\u201d would bring back long-disappeared manufacturing jobs, Trump managed to beat out more than a dozen rivals to grab the nomination.\n\n\u201cHe hijacked our party, and people went along with it,\u201d said Weaver, who had previously worked for Arizona Sen. John McCain. \u201cAnd we have try to fix it for the sake of the country.\u201d\n\nThat, though, may be easier said than done. Most of the changes Trump has imposed on the country have been through executive actions and by altering internal policies at the various executive agencies. As such, they can be undone just as easily by the next president. Similarly, tariffs that have been unilaterally imposed can be unilaterally lifted, and overseas allies that have been rattled by Trump may be soothed by his successor, albeit over a period of years.\n\nChanges to what has now been Trump\u2019s party for three years may be far stickier.\n\nTrump hand-picked a Republican National Committee chair so loyal to him personally that she even stopped using her full name at his suggestion. Committee members who had opposed Trump, meanwhile, tended to either rehabilitate their views or not run for re-election. The RNC now routinely backs Trump\u2019s falsehoods and fear-mongering about immigrants, while Trump\u2019s success has spawned a cohort of mimics, running their campaigns featuring anti-minority, anti-fact themes.\n\nShawn Steel, a prominent RNC member from California, said Trump\u2019s style and tactics were proven correct on Nov. 8, 2016. \u201cHe\u2019s different. He\u2019s done something that our nice guy moderate Republicans couldn\u2019t do. He won.\u201d\n\nFrom Dog Whistle To Bullhorn\n\nTrump certainly was not the first Republican nominee to harness racial animus and xenophobia to win the White House.\n\nThat distinction goes to Richard Nixon, who in 1968 targeted white voters, primarily in the South, who remained angry at the Democratic Party because of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act.\n\nUsing coded themes about \u201claw and order,\u201d Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d let him break into a region that had voted almost exclusively for Democratic presidential nominees since the end of Reconstruction. His resulting victory began the decades-long process that turned the South into a Republican stronghold and flipped the parties\u2019 traditional positions on race. Democrats had for the first half of the century supported segregation while Republicans had generally supported more rights for former slaves and their descendants. Starting in Nixon\u2019s presidency, more and more segregationist Democrats switched to become Republicans, with the remaining Democrats far more in line with the more liberal national party.\n\nRepublican nominees after Nixon continued relying on this racially divisive approach for decades. From Ronald Reagan\u2019s apocryphal Cadillac-driving welfare queen to George H.W. Bush\u2019s Willie Horton television ad to son George W. Bush\u2019s defense of the Confederate flag, appeals to disproportionately Southern, disproportionately rural white voters was an important part of their campaigns.\n\nWhat made Trump\u2019s approach different was his willingness to replace the previous candidates\u2019 dog whistles with a bullhorn.\n\nOn the day of his announcement speech, Trump called Mexicans who crossed the southern border rapists and drug smugglers and then insulted the Mexican government by claiming he would build a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall and force that country to pay for it.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Donald Trump makes his entrance into the 2016 presidential race \u2014 and effectively into the GOP \u2014 at a June 16, 2015, event in which he described Mexicans crossing the border as \"rapists.\"\n\nSubsequently, he insulted a federal judge of Mexican heritage, attacked the Muslim parents of an Army officer who died protecting his troops and promised to stop Muslims from even entering the country.\n\n\u201cTrumpism appeals almost exclusively to those folks \u2015 overtly racist scumbags,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and outspoken Trump critic since the start of the GOP primary in 2015. He estimated that Republicans motivated mainly by race make up about 12 percent of the primary voting base. \u201cThey\u2019re a small faction, but a loud faction. \u2026 The rest of the party is along for the ride. They\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nAt the very first GOP primary debate, in August 2015, when Trump insulted his rivals onstage, the RNC members and their invited guests in the Cleveland audience booed loudly.\n\nBut out in the land of voters, the primary electorate ate it up. Even at the \u201cRed State\u201d gathering of Christian conservatives in Atlanta, Trump was hands down the most popular character on the giant screens at the hotel ballroom where the debate was being televised.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just glad that someone\u2019s finally saying what they want said,\u201d Erick Erickson, the conference host, said at the time. \u201cDonald Trump is at least willing to throw the punches they [the others] are not willing to throw.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sounds Like A Joke Now\u2019\n\nIn the summer of 2013, then-RNC Chairman Reince Priebus unloaded on his party\u2019s nominee the previous year. \u201cUsing the word \u2018self-deportation\u2019 \u2015 I mean, it\u2019s a horrific comment to make,\u201d he said.\n\nMitt Romney\u2019s suggestion during the primaries, that those in the country illegally would \u201cself-deport\u201d as a result of his policies, was mild compared to statements from other Republicans running that year. Herman Cain, for instance, even proposed an electrified border fence.\n\nNevertheless, Romney\u2019s loss to President Barack Obama in a race many Republicans were confident they would win provoked a serious effort to dig into what went wrong and to fix it before 2016. While many of the reforms had to do with better use of voter data and earlier deployment of field staff into key states, the marquee recommendation was that the party had to do a better job with nonwhite voters, particularly Latinos.\n\n\u201cIf we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,\u201d the report stated. \u201cIf Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.\u201d\n\nAl Cardenas, a former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, recently laughed at the memory, and of the outrage heaped on Romney, given where Trump has taken things.\n\n\u201cSounds like a joke now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe irony of the 2012 \u201cautopsy\u201d recommendation and the eventual victory of Trump was not lost on the party\u2019s elder statesmen back in 2016.\n\n\u201cCertainly Donald Trump has gone in the opposite direction from what we recommended,\u201d Ari Fleischer, a former top aide to President George W. Bush and one of the autopsy\u2019s authors, said at the time. \u201cThe things he is espousing are absolutely detrimental to the party. \u2026 For every good point Trump makes, he makes so many derogatory, nasty points. He loses people when he should be winning people.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think the party can survive just on hoping for more Supreme Court justices. Al Cardenas, former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida\n\nFleischer\u2019s view was common among Republicans \u2015 that Trump would likely lose that November to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and that their party would face a long period of rebuilding.\n\nBut when Trump unexpectedly won, the majority of Republican detractors muted their criticisms and seemed to decide that Trump must have been correct all along \u2015 particularly when he rubber-stamped long-standing GOP goals of cutting taxes, repealing regulations and appointing a list of judges compiled by outside conservative groups.\n\n\u201cDonald, just bring me in more judges. A lot more judges,\u201d Steel, the RNC member, said.\n\nAs to the cost such appeasements to Trump\u2019s character \u2015 near constant falsehoods; frequent outbursts of temper; childish taunts against any and all perceived threats \u2015 will impose on the party, that is a different problem for a different day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the growth and maturation of political parties and political movements,\u201d Steel said, adding that the Republican Party would survive just fine, one way or the other. \u201cIt will probably go on for another 150 years.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Heavy Price\u2019\n\nTo \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d like Cardenas and Weaver, a party that has fashioned itself into supporting the likes of Trump does not deserve to survive, not for any length of time.\n\n\u201cThey became Patty Hearst to Trump\u2019s SLA,\u201d Weaver said of today\u2019s RNC, referring to the publishing heiress who was kidnapped by a left-wing militant group only to later join it. \u201cUntil that is burned down to the ground, and acid thrown on top of it, and we start over, there is no Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the party can survive just on hoping for more Supreme Court justices,\u201d said Cardenas, adding that restoring the party to goals of limited government, free trade and a multilateral foreign policy are still doable now, but will become nearly impossible if Trump were to win a second term.\n\n\u201cIt will depend on how the Trump era ends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the next couple of years are difficult for him, if the economy is difficult for him, if the Mueller report is scathing, if his nomination is in doubt \u2015 then yeah, I think the party can disown him.\u201d\n\nThe first order of business toward that end, Trump\u2019s GOP critics agree, is to make sure a serious Republican runs against him for the 2020 nomination. Only three incumbent presidents have lost elections over the past four decades: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three had credible challenges from within their parties for the nomination. In the case of Ford and Carter, those challenges nearly succeeded.\n\nSo far, Weaver\u2019s once-and-perhaps-future boss Kasich has made the most overt moves toward launching a toward launching a 2020 campaign, with a visit to New Hampshire in November and delivering among the most pointed GOP criticisms of Trump over his first two years. Former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Romney, now a senator from Utah, are also thought to be considering challenges. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the latest focus of speculation, as he plans a trip to Iowa in March.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, center, is seen as a possible challenger to Trump in the 2020 Republican primary.\n\nTrump began raising money for his re-election the day he took office, and will have not only a huge financial edge but the advantages of incumbency \u2015 flying to his rallies aboard Air Force One and winning incalculable amounts of attendant free publicity. And while a damaging report from special counsel Robert Mueller could bring on impeachment proceedings or even a sudden resignation, such circumstances cannot be counted on by potential challengers, Cardenas agreed.\n\nHe hopes at least one candidate will take the fight to Trump regardless. \u201cThere is a true Republican story to be told in a campaign. For the sake of our party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they win the nomination or not, they are preserving the values of the party, and hopefully building a base for the future.\u201d\n\nImplicit is the hope that Trump, should he wind up the nominee, lose his re-election, and that the Democrats take the Senate, as well.\n\n\u201cIt will take significant political pain for the party to disown Donald Trump, and so far we have not experienced that level of pain,\u201d Cardenas said.\n\nThe recent midterm elections, when Republicans lost 40 House seats and control of that chamber, was a respectable start to that \u201cpain,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But he added that by itself is not enough to force lasting change.\n\n\u201cIt will take three election losses in a row,\u201d he said \u2015 meaning Democrats will need to win back the White House and Senate in 2020 and then hold both chambers of Congress in 2022 before it becomes clear to Republicans that they need fundamental reforms.\n\n\u201cIt has to be a recognition that it\u2019s something deep and you have the danger of being sent to the ash bin of history,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can survive the way it\u2019s going. Until and unless it\u2019s replaced by a problem-solving conservative party, and not a Trump party.\u201d\n\nFor Weaver, the danger of leaving behind a \u201cTrump party\u201d is the biggest threat of all \u2015 a generation of local, state and federal elected officials mimicking Trump\u2019s verbiage.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michael-steele-trump-national-emergency_n_5c6636dde4b01757c369e993": "Former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele is calling out his own party for enabling President Donald Trump\u2019s reported plan to declare a national emergency to get funding for his border wall.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this is something Republicans will rue,\u201d Steele said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMTP Daily\u201d on Thursday.\n\nSteele warned that once Trump declares an emergency to get funding for his wall, a future Democratic president will be able to do the same for any number of other issues.\n\n\u201cIf any aspect of this is allowed to stand, they have no credence, no authority to criticize any Democratic president who stands up and says, \u2018There\u2019s a national emergency on guns and I\u2019m hereby limiting the sale of future arms in this country,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, later in the day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hinted at exactly that.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about a national emergency?\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America.

John Shimkus (R-Ill.), long a climate change denier who in the past has relied on Bible verses to make his case, argued against the Green New Deal at a House hearing on Wednesday.\n\nIt took just 10 minutes for the attacks to begin.\n\nMoments after he started speaking Wednesday morning before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) urged Democrats to \u201caccept that proposing top-down government requirements to rapidly decarbonize the U.S. and global economies may not be the most realistic way to address the climate change problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should be open to the fact that wealth transfer schemes suggested in the radical policies like the Green New Deal may not be the best path,\u201d said Shimkus, who less than a decade ago deployed Bible verses to dismiss the realities of climate science.\n\nTwo congressional hearings on Wednesday morning \u2015 the first science-based discussions in the House focused on climate change in years \u2015 did little to move the needle on a long-stagnant policy debate on how to keep global warming from reaching temperatures with catastrophic consequences. But GOP opposition to a Green New Deal, the grassroots effort to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions that has energized activists for months, was on full display.\n\nSpeaking shortly after Shimkus, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) cited President Donald Trump\u2019s widely-criticized statements blaming poor forest management for the increasingly deadly and destructive wildfires scorching the West Coast.\n\n\u201cThe Green New Deal ignores many of these important elements of our energy strategy and it makes it difficult to meet our shared environmental goals,\u201d he said.\n\nGetty Editorial Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the leading champion of a Green New Deal, arrives for the State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\nOnce a vague term for clean-energy stimulus, the Green New Deal re-emerged in the political discourse in mid-2018. A cadre of left-wing Democratic candidates began using it to describe plans to spend trillions of dollars on a national industrial strategy to zero out fossil fuel emissions and power the country with 100 percent renewables in a decade.\n\nThe proposals electrified a static debate that too often ranged from outright denialism of climate change by some to dubious market fixes offered by others. Scientists quickly praised the idea of a Green New Deal as the first policy on the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nIn November, newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) positioned herself as the champion of the Green New Deal movement. After failing to persuade House Democratic leaders to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal, she began work on a sweeping new resolution outlining a transformative policy to guarantee high-wage clean energy jobs to millions of Americans and upgrade the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure to withstand already-unavoidable extreme weather and sea level rise.\n\nDespite years of partisan bickering over the realities of climate change, the idea proved popular. Eighty-one percent of registered voters said they supported the main goals of the Green New Deal in a poll released in December. That included 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. Last month, another poll found a narrow majority of voters said they supported a Green New Deal even if it required raising taxes to fund it.\n\nThat did little to alter the objections from conservatives at Wednesday\u2019s hearings.\n\nRich Powell, the executive director of the conservative clean energy advocacy group ClearPath, complained that the emissions projected to come from new coal-fired plants in other countries, particularly India and China, would \u201ccompletely offset\u201d the climate benefits of the U.S. completely decarbonizing.\n\n\u201cIf supporters of a Green New Deal truly believe climate change is an existential threat, they should focus on global solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nAs HuffPost reported on Tuesday, the Green New Deal resolution Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) are expected to unveil this week does just that, calling on the nation to \u201cpromote the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services with the aim to reclaim U.S. leadership on climate change to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nDuring a hearing by the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) dismissed the Green New Deal as an \u201cimpossible,\u201d \u201ctop-down\u201d proposal crafted by young, inexperienced politicians.\n\n\u201cYou only have to be 25 years old to be a member of Congress.

Impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is adults and grownups, who are older and more mature, who are also advocating something that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he added, referring to several of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nThe panel\u2019s Republican members also made a point, in a Twitter post, of deriding the Green New Deal as \u201cnot responsible policymaking.\n\nWe can all agree that these \u201cone size fits all\u201d programs like the Green New Deal, or even the Clean Power Plan, should be avoided. This is simply not responsible policymaking. \u2014 Natural Resources GOP (@NatResources) February 6, 2019\n\nRep.

The group added up the value of contracts at the nine federal agencies for which funding lapsed in December and then divided by the dollar receipts per employee for the related industry groups.\n\nDemocrats have said they\u2019re not sure how many contract workers were affected, but their legislation is designed to pay companies for wage reimbursement so long as each employee\u2019s wages would amount to less than $50,000 on an annualized basis. The program would be voluntary for companies.\n\n\u201cAll the conversations we\u2019ve had with contractors and with people in the federal government who manage contracts tell us this is the most streamlined and simplest way to make this happen, and we expect contractors to ask for that back pay,\u201d Smith told HuffPost last month. \u201cIt\u2019s in their best interest as well as the interest of their workers.\u201d\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Smith said she would continue to push her legislation, though it\u2019s hard to see how it could get through the Senate without being attached to a must-pass spending bill.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lynn-hutchings-homosexuality-bestiality-wyoming-students_us_5c638fdae4b03de94296bdea": "Democrats in Wyoming are calling for a Republican state lawmaker to resign after she reportedly compared homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia during a conversation with a group of high school students.\n\nState Sen.

Martha McSally in 2020. He\u2019s a dream candidate: a naval aviator-turned-astronaut who\u2019s made four trips to space, the husband of a Democratic Party star who survived an assassination attempt, a gun control advocate who\u2019s helped a nationwide network of candidates and built a matching network of donors.\n\nHowever, the party\u2019s left wing is holding off on the celebrations for now. Public records show Kelly voted in the 2012 GOP primary while living in Texas, meaning he likely cast a ballot for either Mitt Romney or one of the host of conservatives running against President Barack Obama and either Ted Cruz or David Dewhurst for Senate. (A Kelly spokesperson said he voted for Obama in the general election.)\n\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images Mark Kelly, a gun control advocate, former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, will be a top Democratic contender for Arizona's Senate seat.\n\nAnd progressives both in the state and nationally have long been preparing for Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino veteran of the war in Afghanistan and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to run for the seat. Gallego is still considering a bid, potentially creating an ideological clash with Kelly. It\u2019s one of a host of potentially pugnacious primaries Democrats could face in 2020 as they seek to win back control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Gallego wrote on Twitter Tuesday, the day Kelly announced his campaign. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed.

Gallego isn\u2019t 100 percent certain to run; his team is still investigating whether it could raise the cash necessary to challenge Kelly in a primary.\n\nMcSally, a moderate-turned-Trump ally who narrowly lost the U.S. Senate race to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in November and was appointed to the seat formerly held by the late John McCain in December, is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot in 2020.\n\nA primary battle between Gallego, 39, and Kelly, 54, could be one of several such contests Senate Democrats face this cycle. While it\u2019s still early in the recruiting process \u2015 Arizona\u2019s primary won\u2019t be until August 2020 \u2015 there\u2019s also the potential for intraparty clashes to determine who will face incumbent Republicans in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. Races in those five GOP-held states, along with the Democrats\u2019 defense of seats in Alabama, Michigan and New Hampshire, are likely to determine which party controls the Senate in 2021. (Democrats are also likely to look at redder territory, including Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and Texas.)\n\nIn Colorado, a host of Democrats are likely to compete for the right to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. Two Democrats who have run for statewide office in the past \u2015 former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff and former state Sen. Mike Johnston \u2015 have already entered the race, and another former state House Speaker, Crisanta Duran, is also considering a challenge to Gardner.\n\nIn both Georgia and North Carolina, Democrats are focused on wooing candidates who could clear the field: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s pursuit of former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to run against Sen. David Perdue is no secret, and Democrats are eyeing Attorney General Josh Stein in North Carolina as a challenger to Sen. Thom Tillis. But if either candidate opts against the run, the field would be wide open. In Iowa and Maine, no consensus candidate has emerged but operatives believe women would be best to challenge Sens. Joni Ernst and Susan Collins.\n\nThe Next Mission For An Undefined Candidate\n\nKelly\u2019s strengths are readily apparent. As the leader of Giffords, the gun control group named for his wife, shooting victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), he\u2019s become a high-profile advocate on a key issue for the Democratic base and played a major role in raising and spending more than $17 million for candidates across the country last cycle.\n\nHis introductory video, however, makes little mention of his gun control work, instead focusing on the rest of his biography: The son of a woman who became one of the first female police officers in the 1970s, he joined the Navy, flew combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and become an astronaut alongside his twin brother. He then left NASA to help Giffords with her recovery.\n\nThe sterling biography, however, hides a candidate who is still ideologically undefined. In the launch video, Kelly makes his opposition to gerrymandering and refusal to take corporate PAC money clear, but how he would solve other problems mentioned in the video \u2015 high health care costs, wage stagnation \u2015 is left unsaid. As one Gallego ally, granted anonymity to speak about Kelly\u2019s weaknesses, said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know a lot about Mark.\u201d\n\nKelly does take a firm stance on his belief in man-made climate change. 314 Action, a group that backs scientists for office, cited that as a reason to quickly endorse him. \u201cVery few people have had the type of view Mark has of the damage climate change has done to our planet,\u201d said Josh Morrow, the group\u2019s executive director, referring to Kelly\u2019s time in outer space.\n\nKelly\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t make him available for an interview, but he told the Arizona Republic he sees himself as someone who\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d and is \u201cnot going to look at these issues through a partisan lens.\u201d Sinema, who is now seen as one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, used similar rhetoric during her 2018 win over McSally.\n\nAnd his vote in the 2012 GOP primary is easy fodder for a Democratic rival. Kelly\u2019s campaign said the candidate didn\u2019t remember whom he voted for in either the presidential or Senate primaries that year.\n\n\u201cMark was an independent at the time, and because President Obama was uncontested, Mark voted in the Republican primary,\u201d said Jacob Peters, Kelly\u2019s communications director. \u201cHe proudly voted for President Obama in the general.\u201d\n\nGallego\u2019s Uphill Battle\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Progressives don't have a great record in recent Senate primaries. Rep. Ruben Gallego will try to change that.\n\nFor Gallego to defeat Kelly would be a reversal of a long-standing political trend. Essentially, no progressive Democrat has triumphed in a contested Senate primary for a GOP-held seat since former Rep. Joe Sestak ousted party-switching Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010. Since then, DSCC-endorsed candidates have squashed candidates like now-Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and former Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.\n\nSchumer has worked assiduously over the years to avoid high-profile primaries in states where Democrats are looking to win GOP-held seats. The Senate Democratic leader has largely been successful, defeating a smattering of left-wing candidates. In the past two election cycles, only two Democratic primaries in targeted Senate seats \u2015 Katie McGinty\u2019s 2016 victory in Pennsylvania and Patty Judge\u2019s win in Iowa the same year \u2015 were decided by fewer than 38 percentage points. (Both women eventually lost to incumbent Republicans.)\n\nThe Harvard-educated Gallego, who supports Medicare for All, marijuana legalization and a $15 minimum wage, would be the first Latino to represent Arizona in the Senate. A successful primary campaign would depend on his ability to craft a coalition of Latino voters and progressives. The ability to unite the party\u2019s liberal base with minority voters has been elusive for progressives in Senate races \u2015 endorsements by Obama helped deliver black voters to the establishment candidates in Florida\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate races in 2016.\n\nBut Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, has already teamed up with Latino Victory Fund to launch a digital campaign encouraging Gallego to run.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-poll-republicans-russian-interference_n_5c631e27e4b0b50014aa989d": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Nearly two years into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds that only a minority of Republican voters believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAnd even though a number of former Trump campaign officials have already pleaded guilty to crimes, a large chunk of Trump voters believes Mueller will eventually conclude that no one on Trump\u2019s team broke any laws.\n\nJust 27 percent of Republicans believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the poll found, with 54 percent saying Russia didn\u2019t play a role and the remainder unsure. By contrast, 80 percent of Democrats and half of the public overall say they believe Russia interfered in the election.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation has led to the indictments of 13 Russians accused of posing as Americans and using social media to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, as well as 12 Russian intelligence officers charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen documents.\n\nWhile members of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2015 George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and Michael Cohen \u2015 have already admitted criminal wrongdoing, 43 percent of Republicans think Mueller\u2019s investigation will conclude that nobody on the Trump campaign committed any crimes. An additional 38 percent expect the investigation to find that members of the Trump campaign, but not the president, commited crimes. Just 6 percent of Republicans expect Mueller to implicate the president.\n\nDemocrats have extremely high expectations the Mueller probe will reach the White House, with 60 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Clinton voters saying they believe Mueller will conclude that Trump himself committed crimes. (Federal prosecutors have already said that Trump \u2015 who they referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d \u2015 directed Cohen to make illegal payments to cover up alleged affairs that could have hurt his campaign.)\n\nOpinions on the Mueller investigation have changed relatively little over the past year, according to the survey, despite a number of new indictments and other developments. Americans are split 38 percent to 37 percent on whether they approve or disapprove of the FBI\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation; in February 2018, they were split 35 percent to 37 percent.\n\nAs in past polling, opinions remain largely ossified along partisan lines, and often even more sharply along electoral ones. Just 34 percent of Trump voters have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with nearly three-quarters believing the bureau is biased against the president. By contrast, 84 percent of Clinton voters express at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with about two-thirds expecting the agency to deal fairly with Trump. Both sets of numbers are little changed from the previous survey.\n\nThe remainder of the public, whose political views might be more malleable, are largely tuned out of the story. Just 26 percent of non-voters say they\u2019ve been following about Mueller\u2019s investigation even somewhat closely, and only 27 percent report having at least a fairly good understanding of what the investigation has uncovered. More than half say they\u2019re not sure whether they approve of Mueller\u2019s handling of his job as special counsel.\n\nAbout the same percentage of Trump and Clinton voters said they were following news about the Russia probe \u201cvery closely,\u201d but a larger number of Trump voters (36 percent) than Clinton voters (30 percent) claimed they understood what Mueller had uncovered \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\nThe survey indicated that 73 percent of Clinton voters thought the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia was a \u201cvery serious problem,\u201d while 63 percent of Trump voters thought it was \u201cnot a problem at all.\u201d Nine out of 10 Clinton voters believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election, while 50 percent of Trump voters say Russia did not interfere in the election.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions, and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Trump for President and two related campaign committees raised a total of $130 million over the past two years, according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission, with $26 million of that transferred to the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, was outraised $90 million by its Democratic counterpart. Republicans, who held the House since the 2010 election, lost 40 seats and control of the chamber.\n\n\u201cTrump darkens the sun. There is nothing else out there,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a GOP consultant and longtime Trump critic, adding that Trump\u2019s targeting and \u201cbleeding\u201d of small donors meant congressional candidates were less likely to get those contributions.\n\n\u201cSmall donors, those giving $20 or $50, are donors on a limited budget,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTrump has decapitated the party. This is just another example. The money has to go to the cult leader first. It has to go to the king first.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. In previous remarks, Trump has boasted of how hard he worked for GOP candidates with dozens of rallies last summer and fall.\n\n\u201cThis vigorous campaigning stopped the \u2018blue wave\u2019 that they talked about,\u201d he said the morning after the midterm elections while calling the results \u201cvery close to complete victory.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed frequently that his rallies around the country helped Republican candidates, even though the candidates typically appeared on stage with Trump for only a few minutes of an hourlong event at venues that featured primarily Trump signage and placards.\n\nOne Republican official familiar with the House campaigns said that Trump\u2019s insistence on making the focus of the election himself, both in terms of fundraising as well as the themes, was not helpful.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of the backlash of Trump without getting much of the benefit,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity, pointing to Trump\u2019s hammering on illegal immigrants forming caravans to \u201cinvade\u201d the United States as particularly problematic.\n\nRepublicans lost and nearly lost races in California, Texas and Florida because of Trump, the official said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that immigration hurt us in a bunch of places.\u201d\n\nIn a news release Thursday night, the campaign boasted that it had raised $21 million in just the final three months of 2018. \u201cThese totals continue a record fundraising streak for a president\u2019s first eight quarters in office,\u201d the release stated.\n\nWhat the release failed to state was that Trump holds the \u201crecord\u201d because no previous candidate was raising money for re-election so early in his term. President Barack Obama did not start his re-election campaign until April 2011. President George W. Bush opened his re-election account in May 2003.\n\nTrump, in contrast, opened his re-election campaign account the day he was inaugurated in January 2017 and began staging rallies almost immediately. Previous presidents spent their first two years raising money for their parties, for their parties\u2019 congressional committees and, at times, for individual candidates.\n\n\u201cMost presidents help raise money for candidates,\u201d said Al Cardenas, once the state Republican Party chairman in Florida and a close ally of the Bush family. \u201cIs there really justification to suck all the oxygen out of the room so quickly?\u201d\n\nTrump did donate $2,000 each to 106 House and Senate candidates in July, but with House campaigns today often costing millions of dollars, those were of token benefit at best. Trump could have, had he wanted, spent far more money on \u201cindependent expenditures\u201d to benefit candidates in tight races, had he done so without coordinating with the campaign in question.\n\nHe did not, however, and instead most of the money he raised went toward fundraising costs, staging rallies around the country and selling Trump-branded campaign gear. Hundreds of thousands more went to Trump properties that he personally profits from \u2015 $150,167 in the final three months of 2018 to Trump Tower alone, where he rents office space from himself.\n\n\u201cHe had all the money in the world,\u201d Wilson said, adding that some of that could have made the difference in races that were lost by thousands or even hundreds of votes. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he wouldn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump did headline fundraisers for both the NRCC and the National Senatorial Republican Committee as well as help raise $325 million for the Republican National Committee, which helps Republican candidates up and down the ballot.\n\nThat help, though, comes with strict rules and limits attached, and is not as beneficial to the candidates as money raised by the candidates themselves, officials agreed.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rnc-donald-trump-adjective_us_5c5bf54ae4b00187b55869bf": "Twitter users mocked the Republican National Committee over its attempt to put a positive spin on President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nThe RNC promoted a page on its website Wednesday which detailed \u201cjust a few of the words\u201d that were being used in the \u201crave reviews\u201d people had given Trump\u2019s speech:\n\nJust a few of the words being used to describe @realDonaldTrump\u2019s #SOTU Address \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/36HnaejsxW \u2014 GOP (@GOP) February 7, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s address to the joint session of Congress did not receive the overwhelmingly positive reception the RNC claimed.

Attorneys for Harris filed suit in state court earlier this month saying the state board was required to certify Harris the winner because votes had been tabulated correctly and no voters had filed a protest. They asked a judge to force the state board to certify Harris the winner.\n\nWake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway denied that request on Tuesday, saying that the state board had the legal authority to deny certification to Harris while it investigated irregularities. When the state board began probing the election in late November, it amounted to a legal protest of the election, Ridgeway ruled. State law requires the board to issue certification five days after a protest is dismissed or denied.\n\n\u201cNothing about today\u2019s court hearing changes the fact that @MarkHarrisNC9 won the election, has more legal votes, and no public evidence has put the outcome in doubt. We are confident Pastor Harris won, will be Certified and will be seated,\u201d Robin Hayes, chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said in a statement.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in an ongoing probe that has drawn national attention. McCrae Dowless, an operative working on Harris\u2019 behalf, is accused of paying people to collect completed absentee ballots from voters \u2015 something that violates North Carolina law. Both Harris and Dowless have denied wrongdoing.\n\nDemocrats, who took control of the U.S. House in January, have also indicated they would not seat Harris until the state board\u2019s investigation was complete. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chair of the Committee on House Administration, which would oversee an investigation, sent a letter to the state board earlier in January asking it to preserve all evidence in its investigation. Currently voters in North Carolina\u2019s 9th congressional district do not have a representative in the U.S. House.\n\nComplicating the investigation is the status of the state board of elections. In October, a 3-judge panel struck down the state board, saying changes legislative Republicans made to the board were unconstitutional. The judges allowed the panel to remain in existence through the November 2018 elections, and then continued its existence as the probe into the Harris-McCready race began. But when the investigation took longer than expected, the panel dissolved the state board in December.

Scott Walker (R) left office. The laws being challenged include cuts to early voting and limits on the governor\u2019s ability to withdraw from lawsuits and make certain appointments.\n\nThe suit, filed in Dane County Circuit Court, argues that the laws are invalid because lawmakers passed them in what\u2019s called an \u201cextraordinary session.\u201d The session was established through a joint legislative rule, but the lawsuit argues it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe Wisconsin Constitution states that the legislature shall meet \u201cat such time as shall be provided by law, unless convened by the governor in special session.\u201d The lawsuit says that the \u201cextraordinary session\u201d late last year was unconstitutional because lawmakers didn\u2019t pass a law authorizing it and it wasn\u2019t called by the governor.\n\n\u201cThe Legislature lacked legal authority to convene the December 2018 Extraordinary Session,\u201d the plaintiffs wrote in their complaint. \u201cNeither the Wisconsin Constitution nor any statute authorizes the Legislature, let alone a small subset of each chamber acting at the direction of its respective Organizing Committee, to convene itself in an \u2018extraordinary session.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe legislative rule authorizing extraordinary sessions was adopted in 1977, according to a 2014 report from the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.

Mike Noel preferential treatment when he redrew the boundary of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\n\nThe months-long investigation by the agency\u2019s Office of Inspector General came at the request of Montana-based environmental group Western Values Project. Investigators looked into whether Noel influenced the Trump administration\u2019s decision to dismantle the protected site.\n\nLate last year, on Zinke\u2019s recommendation, Trump cut the 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante, the largest land national monument in the country, roughly in half. The rollback opened the door for oil and gas exploration and for other development.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump signs the hat of Bruce Adams, chairman of the San Juan County Commission, after signing a proclamation to shrink the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City.\n\nNoel, a vocal opponent of the monument established during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, advocated for shrinking the site and applauded President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to do so and then tried to rename a Utah highway after the president as a thank you. He also owns a 40-acre parcel that was ultimately stripped of monument protections. Western Values Project argued that Noel\u2019s failure to disclose his land ownership while pushing for a rollback of the monument was a conflict of interest, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n\nIn their seven-page report, investigators said they interviewed Zinke, Noel and several Interior Department officials directly involved in the administration\u2019s review of Grand Staircase-Escalante. A summary of the findings was obtained by The Associated Press in November.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence that Noel influenced the [Department of Interior\u2019s] proposed revisions to the [monument\u2019s] boundaries, that Zinke or any other DOI employee involved in the project were aware of Noel\u2019s financial interest in the revised boundaries, or that anyone at the DOI gave Noel preferential treatment when proposing the boundary modifications,\u201d the report states.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former Utah state Rep. Mike Noel, a Republican, owned land within the original monument boundaries.\n\nZinke told investigators he was unaware that Noel owned property inside the original boundary and did not direct agency staff to remove any private property, including Noel\u2019s, from the monument, according to the report. Likewise, Noel told investigators he did not ask Zinke or any other agency official to carve out his property. Interior staff had \u201cvarying degrees of knowledge\u201d about Noel\u2019s property ownership but said they were not pressured to cut it from the monument, the report states.\n\nIn an interview Thursday with the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, Noel said that he \u201cnever had any doubt I would be exonerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI answered everything truthfully,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI have never, ever brought up to the Department of Interior or the Bureau of Land Management my personal property holdings.\u201d\n\nNoel retired last year after 16 years in the Utah Legislature and is currently the executive director of the Kane County Water Conservancy District. Zinke resigned in early January under a cloud of ethics scandals.\n\nOIG\u2019s probe also concludes that the Department of the Interior \u201chad no formal processes in place for modifying national monument boundaries\u201d but that agency staff \u201cdeveloped a process and followed it when reviewing\u201d Grand Staircase-Escalante and other sites subject to Zinke\u2019s review.

First reported by HuffPost, the agency\u2019s recommendation \u2015 buried in a draft resource management plan for the area \u2015 called for the selling or transferring of 16 federal parcels, including 120 acres in between properties owned by Noel.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicaid-michigan-whitmer-verma-gop_us_5c5dcaffe4b0910c63f035db": "Between 61,000 and 183,000 low-income residents of Michigan are likely to lose government-provided health insurance next year, thanks to new Medicaid rules the state Republican legislature passed last summer and that the newly elected Democratic governor now wants those lawmakers to amend.\n\nThe changes apply to people who got Medicaid because of Michigan\u2019s expansion of the program, in 2014, when the state tapped federal dollars available through the Affordable Care Act and opened enrollment to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line. Under new requirements set to take effect in January 2020, those beneficiaries must demonstrate they are working at least 20 hours a week, trying to find work or unable to work.\n\nSupporters, including GOP leaders in the legislature, say the new requirement and reporting regimen will encourage people to find jobs \u2015 and that, more fundamentally, it\u2019s wrong to demand taxpayers subsidize health care for people who could find employment but don\u2019t.\n\nBut most people who got coverage through the Medicaid expansion are either working already or cannot hold jobs, because they are caring for others or have serious conditions of their own, studies have shown repeatedly. And in Arkansas, which imposed work requirements last year, more than 18,000 people lost their coverage for failing to comply.\n\nIf local reporting and available data are indicative, people aren\u2019t generally losing coverage because these people actually failed to meet the work requirement or lack qualifying hardships. Instead, they are losing coverage because they had difficulty navigating the complex reporting requirements.\n\nAdvocates for the poor worry the same thing will soon happen in Michigan, only on an even larger scale, and that it probably won\u2019t stop there.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's newly elected Democratic governor, is urging the GOP state legislature to roll back Medicaid work requirements slated to take effect next year.\n\nThe federal Medicaid law, which dates back to 1965, requires that states seeking major changes get special permission from the federal government. The Obama administration looked askance at work requirements on the theory that they could harm beneficiaries, which would be a clear violation of the Medicaid statute.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a different attitude, approving seven such applications, including Michigan\u2019s, with another eight now pending.\n\nSeema Verma, chief administrator of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been a vocal proponent of the work requirements \u2015 arguing last year that they are \u201cnot some subversive attempt to just kick people off of Medicaid \u2026 their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.\u201d\n\nBut there is scant evidence that work requirements encourage people to find employment. If anything, the evidence suggests the opposite \u2015 that Medicaid coverage makes it easier for people to find and hold on to jobs, most likely because they don\u2019t have to worry about medical problems that would make work difficult.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not clear how much the Trump administration cares about what happens to the people who lose Medicaid \u2015 or whether it cares at all. Among the first states to get the administration\u2019s go-ahead for work requirements, not a single one of them had created systems for checking whether people losing coverage end up in better jobs or with better health, according to an investigation that the Los Angeles Times published this week.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to look at the requirements and not see them as part of a broader, more general assault on government-financed health insurance \u2015 an assault that is still ongoing, all across the country, even though GOP efforts to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d were perhaps the single biggest reason Republicans suffered such a devastating rebuke at the polls in the midterm elections.\n\nMichigan, a state that was pivotal in Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential victory, was actually one of the states where Republicans fared worse. They lost a pair of closely contested congressional races along with the top statewide offices, up to and including governor.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, the state senator who would eventually win that contest, attacked her GOP opponent for supporting repeal of the Affordable Care Act. She also touted her role in getting the Medicaid expansion through the state legislature.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Seema Verma, who oversees Medicaid for the Trump administration, has urged states to impose work requirements on Medicaid \u2014 and approved several applications to do so.\n\nMichigan has been a case study in what the expansion can accomplish. Approximately 680,000 residents now have health insurance through the expansion, and as a result they are more likely to get medical care (like treatment for heart conditions) and less likely to experience financial distress (like running up credit card debts), according to studies by researchers at the University of Michigan.\n\nBut Michigan\u2019s legislature, where gerrymandering has given conservative Republicans extra clout, resisted the expansion for years, even though the former two-term governor, Republican Rick Snyder, was in favor.\n\nWith Snyder on his way out of office last year, because of term limits, and the GOP\u2019s hold on that position in clear jeopardy, the legislature passed (and Snyder eventually signed) legislation creating the work requirements. That legislation included a \u201ctrigger\u201d provision that would have rolled back the expansion altogether if the federal government didn\u2019t give approval, which it did pending confirmation and a few minor modifications from the state.\n\nOn Friday, Whitmer provided the Trump administration with that confirmation, setting the stage for the work requirements to start next January. But in the official letter, Whitmer repeated some of the objections she had made as a candidate \u2015 and cited a new analysis, from the national consulting firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips, projecting that Arkansas-level effects would mean 183,000 people on Medicaid losing their insurance, or more than a quarter of the people who got coverage through the expansion.\n\n\u201cThe effect of these coverage losses on individuals\u2019 health and financial security is sobering to contemplate,\u201d Whitmer wrote. \u201cAs in Arkansas, Michigan\u2019s new law provides no resources for job training, job search, or job supports. There is no reason to expect better job outcomes.\u201d\n\nIt will be up to the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services to put in place the new system for beneficiaries to report their work status. But while Michigan already has a well-developed online portal for public benefits, Robert Gordon, the new state secretary of health and human services, said he too worries about a replay of the Arkansas experience \u2015 with people losing coverage even when they are following the rules when it comes to employment.\n\n\u201cWhether or not they make sense in principle, we know what happens with work requirements,\u201d Gordon told HuffPost. \u201cPeople don\u2019t get information on how to comply, they don\u2019t understand how they are supposed to comply, they try to comply and are not able to, or they comply and government makes a mistake and doesn\u2019t realize it.\u201d\n\nWhitmer campaigned for governor as somebody who could get things done, like \u201cfixing the damn roads,\u201d by citing her history of bipartisan work in the state senate. But GOP lawmakers are already pushing to block or overturn some of her early moves, including a rollback of Snyder-era changes that give business groups more sway over environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cAlthough the governor says she is committed to partnering with the legislature, she first makes us aware of her intent to water down Michigan\u2019s thoughtful Medicaid work requirements via a press release,\u201d Mike Shirkey, Republican leader in the state Senate, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI will be an active listener and participant in discussions with my governor, but I wholeheartedly believe the work requirement is necessary for Healthy Michigan to continue to function,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans believe, rightly or wrongly, that work requirements are popular. Whether they reconsider the Medicaid changes could depend in part on whether they face political pressure \u2015 say, from from advocates for the poor or the health care industry, and the governor as well.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-scarborough-republicans-donald-trump-birther_n_5c656e05e4b0233af97257d5": "\u201cThere are so many examples of how this Republican majority in the House of Representatives and this Republican president have used racism and bigotry and, of course, the original sin was Donald Trump\u2019s birtherism.

That\u2019s so many circuit judges \u2015 more than any other president had confirmed by this point in his first term \u2015 that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.\n\nBut Democrats and progressive groups aren\u2019t just alarmed by the number of Trump\u2019s picks sailing through. Many of these nominees have spent their careers attacking LGBTQ rights, abortion rights and voting rights, and now they\u2019re on their way to holding lifetime seats on federal courts.\n\nAs Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) pointed out in Thursday\u2019s hearing, more than 80 percent of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees so far are members of the conservative Federalist Society. For some context, she noted that less than 4 percent of all American lawyers are members of that group.\n\n\u201cMonth after month, we have seen a parade of these so-called conservative activists nominated to the federal courts,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cThey have been groomed by conservative political ideologues. They want to see Roe v. Wade overturned or narrowed into oblivion, LGBT people permanently consigned to the margins of American life, and constitutional and civil rights encroached [based] on the religious preference of a vocal few.\u201d\n\nThis story would be pages long if we spelled out the records of all of the controversial nominees who just advanced, so here\u2019s a sampling of the people drawing some of the fiercest criticism from civil and women\u2019s rights groups. All of these nominees are likely to be confirmed given Republicans\u2019 majority in the Senate.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Allison Jones Rushing\n\nAllison Jones Rushing, nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit\n\nThe 37-year-old attorney was a legal intern at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has classified as a \u201chate group,\u201d and mentored people through the organization\u2019s controversial Blackstone Legal Fellowship program.\n\nAs reported by Rewire in 2013, the Blackstone program focuses on \u201cfighting for the criminalization of abortion; against the rights of LGBT people; for so-called religious liberty (which often comes in the form of defending clients who wish to discriminate against gay people based on their religious beliefs); and for organized Christian prayer in government or public school settings.\u201d\n\nRushing also argued in a 2013 panel discussion that there were \u201cboth moral and practical\u201d reasons for creating the Defense of Marriage Act, the former federal law that banned same-sex marriage. She frequently referenced the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision striking down part of DOMA that said it departed from \u201ctraditional\u201d concepts of marriage and morality.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Eric D.

In a 2016 amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court, he wrote that a Washington state law requiring pharmacists either to fill a medical prescription or find an available pharmacist who will, which had been upheld by the 9th Circuit, \u201cauthorizes an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion on the most basic right of conscience.\u201d The Supreme Court let the 9th Circuit decision stand.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Wendy Vitter\n\nWendy Vitter, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana\n\nThe 58-year-old attorney is a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn\u2019t tell senators about her extreme comments on the topic.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood says they promote women\u2019s health,\u201d Vitter said in a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new clinic in New Orleans. \u201cIt is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women\u2019s health is to let them live.\u201d\n\nAhead of her 2018 confirmation hearing, Vitter, whose husband is former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), did not disclose to the committee that she had moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference peddling false information about the dangers of abortion \u2015 or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms claiming that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News later uncovered these missing materials.\n\nC-SPAN Howard C. Nielson Jr.\n\nHoward C.

When a U.S. district court ruled in 2010 that Prop 8 violated the Constitution, Nielson argued that then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker should have recused himself from the case because he was gay and therefore, Nielson claimed, unable to be fair on the issue. He filed a motion contending that Walker \u201chad a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his [same-sex] relationship, but also his marriage intentions.\u201d That motion was denied by another judge.\n\nNielson also defended a former Justice Department colleague who wrote a controversial and now-rescinded memo authorizing the CIA\u2019s use of torture.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Patrick Wyrick\n\nPatrick Wyrick, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nThe 37-year-old Oklahoma Supreme Court justice made limiting reproductive rights a top priority when he previously served as state solicitor general. In one case, he defended a law that would have required minors to obtain a prescription before buying emergency contraception. The law would have also forced adult women to prove their age before purchasing such contraception. The legislation was permanently blocked by a state judge in 2014.\n\nWyrick filed an amicus brief in the landmark 2014 Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations are in some circumstances exempt from regulations their owners object to on religious grounds \u2014 specifically, the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his brief, Wyrick argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because \u201creligious faith is more than mere belief.

The Republican-controlled state Senate has agreed to give school employees another raise, but only with some major strings attached. These include the creation of charter schools in the state and a new voucher-like system that would steer public money to private schools.\n\nThe education omnibus bill that cleared the chamber by an 18-16 margin on Monday includes a number of conservative proposals that GOP legislators have put forth in the past. But now lawmakers have coupled them with much of what educators fought for last year, and teacher representatives say the legislation would ultimately divert money away from public schools.\n\n\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s retaliation for what we did last spring,\u201d said Fred Albert, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, one of the state\u2019s two main teachers unions.\n\nThose unions and the union representing school support staff have asked their local affiliates to hold votes on whether to green-light walkouts or other protests in response to the legislation. Workers are casting ballots by Friday.\n\nUnion leaders suspect the vast majority of their members will approve of walking off the job in the event the most controversial measures appear likely to become law. No date for a walkout has been set.\n\nThe education package passed in the Senate headed Tuesday to the House, which also has a Republican majority. But House members serve shorter terms \u2015 two years, as opposed to four \u2015 and may be more amenable to pressure from teachers and other school employees in their districts.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the bill that passed the Senate will not survive in the same form. Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has already said he would veto it if it did.\n\nEven so, Kym Randolph, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Education Association, said they consider the package a serious threat, noting that it only takes a simple majority in each legislative chamber to override a governor\u2019s veto.\n\nRandolph said teachers want to avoid something as drastic as a walkout, but feel \u201cincensed\u201d by the omnibus bill and the way it was fast-tracked through the upper chamber. As reported by The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported, Senate leaders used an arcane procedural maneuver to bypass a review of the legislation by a finance committee once it became obvious there weren\u2019t enough votes for it to clear that panel.\n\nDave Jamieson/HuffPost\n\nTeachers have \u201cwatched the actions of the Senate, and it\u2019s like the matador with the red cape,\u201d she said. The teachers \u201cwent back to work and now the Senate has gone this route. It\u2019s kind of disrupting the whole process again.\u201d\n\nThe most controversial aspects of the legislative plan would establish a public charter system and create \u201deducation savings accounts.\u201d The latter would grant families around $3,200 a year in public money to put toward a child\u2019s private school costs, tutoring or online education, so long as the child is not a full-time public school student. The number of accounts statewide would be capped at 2,500, to be made eligible on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nLike with other charter or voucher proposals, many teachers and their unions in West Virginia worry the plan would siphon much-needed money out of public schools over time. The West Virginia Schools Athletic Coaches Association came out strongly against the bill, arguing that it would lead to \u201cchaos\u201d in sports and prompt transfers.\n\nA report by The Beckley Register-Herald illustrated one of the biggest concerns: that wealthier and more stable families would be best positioned to take advantage of the charters and savings accounts, leaving poor children behind in lower-performing schools. The Gazette-Mail reported that at least seven of 18 senators who advanced the bill had children who did not go to public schools.\n\nThe groundbreaking walkout that began late last February was meant to reverse years of lackluster investment in the public school system. Like many other states, West Virginia saw a steep drop in revenue in the wake of the Great Recession, a problem exacerbated by years of tax cuts. That left the state with little money to give to teachers, who went years without meaningful raises. Their higher health care costs meant take-home pay was effectively going down for many.\n\nThe state has no collective bargaining for teachers and other school employees; the unions basically function as lobbies, with pay scales set by the state legislature. Last year\u2019s nine-day walkout, which was illegal under state law, forced lawmakers to agree to a five percent raise for public employees, as well as develop a plan to fund the state health insurance plan. The success of the walkout helped spur similar ones in Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona.\n\nAlbert, of AFT-West Virginia, said the fast-moving education bill made it clear the fight was far from over. He said the legislature should pass a stand-alone bill assuring raises for educators, leaving out the controversial measures that the state Senate added. If not, he said, schools could end up closed again, with teachers flooding the capitol.\n\n\u201cThey feel, like I do, that this bill has harmful things in there and it seems like payback,\u201d Albert said. \u201cThey\u2019re still inspired to carry on what they did last year.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tommy-norment-racist-yearbook-blackface-virginia-senator_us_5c5c6fefe4b0d073e7043f0b": "Virginia Military Institute Two photos from VMI's 1968 yearbook, which was edited by the future state Sen.

Even if Democrats manage to claw back to power in the Senate and recapture the White House in 2020, the GOP would likely prevent them from advancing to a final vote by using the filibuster.\n\nThat\u2019s why some on the left are pushing Democrats to either be honest with voters about the chances of passing major legislation they\u2019ve introduced or simply rip the Band-Aid off and ditch a rule that doesn\u2019t actually appear in the Constitution anyway.\n\n\u201cThe Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. [Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell] will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything. If Dems win the WH & Senate in 2020, they should nuke the 60-vote threshold on day one and get on with it,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for ex-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said last month.\n\nOther progressives like Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice have argued that Democrats stand to benefit more from eliminating the filibuster because Republicans are generally less likely to propose sweeping changes in domestic policy due to their conservative ideology.\n\nBut nearly a dozen Democrats rejected those arguments in interviews on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, calling the filibuster a critical tool that helps foster bipartisanship, as well as a means of guarding against political passions that can bubble up in the House and the executive branch. Many of those Democratic senators also expressed concern about a scenario in which Republicans once again controlled both Congress and the White House.\n\nIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive.

So while I understand the frustration ... I think the consequences of getting rid of it are too great,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday.\n\nIndeed, if the filibuster had not been on the books during the first two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans could have passed a whole host of legislation Democrats most likely would not liked to have seen become law \u2015 including, possibly, funding for his border wall.\n\n\u201cWhat you might think today would be in your favor, might not be in your favor tomorrow,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who was just elected to a six-year term, added on Tuesday.\n\nSome Democrats still harbor regrets over the decision in 2013 to unilaterally end the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. Democratic leaders said at the time they were forced to take the step to confirm a number of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees given unprecedented GOP obstruction from people like McConnell. Reid, who pulled the trigger on the rule change, still maintains that it was the right thing to do. But now that Republicans are confirming young, conservative judicial nominees at a historic pace under the Trump administration, some Democrats say there is reason for caution about going even further.\n\n\u201cI would remind people there was a lot of interest in getting rid of the filibuster for judges and for the Supreme Court, and that has not served us well,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked whether she supported eliminating the filibuster on legislation.\n\nMany 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls also share concerns about going nuclear to kill the filibuster. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the most recent entry in the field, said last week he would \u201cpersonally resist efforts to get rid of it.\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said last month she would consider ending the filibuster. In the meantime, the presidential candidate said that lacking 60 votes \u201cmeans you haven\u2019t done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a potential White House contender, has endorsed several progressive proposals on health care and climate change. He has also recently introduced legislation that would drastically expand the estate tax on the wealthy, a proposal he says would would raise $2.2 trillion. But the senator declined to address how to go about getting such proposals passed into law on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit speculative. I need to worry about what\u2019s happening in the country right now. That\u2019s a little bit into the future,\u201d Sanders said when asked whether he supported killing the filibuster.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, was the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who did not rule out the prospect of going nuclear in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cEverything stays on the table. You keep it all on the table. Don\u2019t take anything off the table,\u201d Warren said in an interview with Politico last week.\n\nThe debate over the filibuster is likely to heat up in the Democratic primary over the next two years with many progressives in the race floating a wish list of progressive proposals on everything from health care and taxes, to voting rights and climate change. But some Democrats think the conversation isn\u2019t exactly productive for the party when it comes to running Washington.\n\n\u201cSome of us have to think about governing. ... In terms of nuts and bolts, in terms of making this place work better, I don\u2019t think that talk is helpful,\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting he was not running for president.\n\nThe likelihood of ending the 60-vote threshold on legislation is extremely small in the near future due to bipartisan opposition. Trump repeatedly pushed McConnell to kill the filibuster last year in order to build the wall, for example. The Kentucky senator has resisted the president\u2019s entreaties, estimating in an interview last year that two-thirds of his caucus oppose doing so.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster, which has been around for a long time, is a problem. And it does, I think, generate on many occasions kind of a bipartisan solution, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always bad for the country,\u201d McConnell said in the interview.\n\nStill, progressives don\u2019t view the threat of a filibuster as an impediment to proceeding with legislation like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In fact, they argue that building political support for big new ideas often takes time, and the traditional place where that has occurred in the past is in the lower chamber.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-emergency-congress_us_5c5c9ecbe4b0e01e32aa9b4b": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Does President Donald Trump\u2019s need to please his most vocal supporters with a border wall constitute a national emergency?\n\nWhile federal courts may ultimately have to decide that question, Republican senators almost certainly will have to take a public stand on it, one way or the other, possibly within a few weeks of an anticipated declaration that has support within Trump\u2019s base but nowhere else.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be without controversy,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News this week, just days after meeting privately with Trump on the matter in the Oval Office. \u201cIf he goes that route we\u2019ll just hash it out.\u201d\n\nTrump has been threatening for months to declare a \u201cnational emergency\u201d and divert money from other programs to build hundreds of miles of wall along the Mexican border if Congress does not appropriate $5.7 billion for the project. He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers \u2014 including his own Secret Service detail \u2014 began their second month without a paycheck.\n\nNow, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nOne former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way he gets it done,\u201d said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump. \u201cAnd screw Puerto Rico,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cPuerto Rico doesn\u2019t have electoral votes last time I checked.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.\n\nWhile Trump has the authority to declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill \u2014 a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.\n\nOne of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. \u201cI would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,\u201d he said of the possible emergency declaration. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad law and I think it\u2019s bad strategy for the president.\u201d\n\nKeeping The Public Scared\n\nTrump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an \u201cemergency\u201d that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trump\u2019s own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.\n\nMigrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201cvery bad people.\u201d\n\nWhen the November election passed, so did Trump\u2019s interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up \u201ccaravans\u201d until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.\n\nTrump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last month\u2019s shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native \u2014 also white \u2014 has been charged in those slayings.\n\n\u201cHe continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. That\u2019s his MO. It\u2019s not new,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201cUnfortunately, it works, among some people. But it\u2019s really cynical politics.\u201d\n\nTriggering A National Emergency\n\nCynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.\n\nTrump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2015 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities,\u201d Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. \u201cNow, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.\u201d\n\nThat brought a rebuke from the city\u2019s mayor the next day. \u201cWe are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,\u201d Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC. \u201cI talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But we\u2019ve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation.\u201d\n\nPrimarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.\n\nWhile Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nDoing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a \u201cjoint resolution\u201d of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans \u2014 and could possibly lose a good deal more.\n\nSome Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m urging the president to tread carefully,\u201d said Texas Republican John Cornyn.\n\nSusan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach. \u201cI think I\u2019ve expressed serious concern about going down that path but let\u2019s wait and see what the president does before we decide,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d he told reporters late last week. \u201cWe will be looking at a national emergency, because I don\u2019t think anything is going to happen.

Greg Abbott is still defending his state\u2019s decision, describing it as a legitimate effort to curb illegal voting.\n\n\u201cThis is what you would categorize as a process,\u201d Abbott said at a press conference Thursday morning, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s important to let the data speak for itself.\u201d\n\nSo far, the data indicate that state leaders jumped the gun.\n\nA List Riddled With False Positives\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, middle, isn't worried about his state's disastrous citizenship probe.\n\nTexas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) issued a statement Friday saying his office had identified about 95,000 noncitizens who had registered to vote, including about 58,000 who had cast a ballot at some time over the last two decades. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton echoed the announcement, tagging it on Twitter with the words \u201cVOTER FRAUD ALERT.\u201d By Sunday, President Donald Trump added to the uproar, baselessly calling it the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d and demanding \u201cstrong voter ID\u201d \u2015 despite the fact that Texas already requires photo ID to cast a ballot.\n\nCritics and legal groups contested the allegations, noting that the state had culled the list primarily by checking voter registration records against those maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards. That agency belongs to the state and doesn\u2019t keep updated citizenship records \u2015 it only requires proof of citizenship when people apply for state IDs. That leaves open the possibility that people who naturalized after obtaining or renewing their identification cards would still be flagged.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. With each passing day, it becomes clearer that the secretary of state\u2019s list is riddled with tens of thousands of false positives.\n\nThe office has made lurching and inconsistent steps to solve the problem it created. On Monday, facing a storm of criticism, the secretary of state\u2019s office recalculated the list of suspected noncitizen voters, arriving at a higher figure of 98,000. But a day later, it backtracked, quietly notifying county registrars that thousands of the people named were in fact citizens, the Texas Tribune first reported.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office did not respond to a request for an updated list. But Harris County, which encompasses Texas\u2019s largest city of Houston, so far has struck nearly two-thirds of the 29,341 names from its list of suspected noncitizen voters because they turned out to be citizens, according to County Attorney Douglas Ray. The list also included about 400 duplicates.\n\nThe list sent to El Paso County included a naturalized citizen who works at that county office, election official Lisa Wise told HuffPost. In McLennan County, home to the city of Waco, every one of the 366 original names turned out to be a falsely flagged U.S. citizen, the Waco Tribune-Herald reported.\n\nAnd Galveston County sent out letters this week to 163 suspected noncitizen voters, giving them 30 days to provide proof of citizenship \u2015 only to discover before receiving responses that at least 58 of them were incorrectly identified by the secretary of state\u2019s office. In those 58 cases, county officials sent new letters telling the voters to disregard the first one.\n\nRequests For Information Met With Crickets\n\nBoth the Mexican American Legislative Caucus and a coalition of legal and activist groups demanded that the Republican leadership of Texas rescind the list, without success. The League of United Latin American Citizens filed a federal lawsuit to block the probe Tuesday, and other legal groups are considering litigation.\n\nDemocratic state lawmakers have also used legislative privilege to demand more information about how the secretary of state\u2019s office came up with the list. Those requests are typically filled within a couple of days, but the office has yet to comply, state Rep. Celia Israel (D-Austin) told HuffPost.\n\nThe state\u2019s House Committee on Elections will likely call Whitley to testify within the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to the secretary of state in a public forum and the attorney general, and his staff, and say: How did you cook this idea up?\u201d Israel said. \u201cWhere did it come from? There seems to be some synchronicity to how you guys are messaging.\u201d\n\nIsrael noted that she and her chief of staff met with Whitley the day before he announced the voter probe. But he failed to mention that it was coming.\n\nThe voter investigation came three months after the midterm elections, which saw major gains for Democrats in a majority-minority state where Republicans have long held firm control, despite their demographic disadvantage. Because the historically low Latino voter turnout rate has favored Republicans, critics have viewed the probe as a political stunt aimed at making naturalized citizens fearful of registering to vote.\n\nSome 78 percent of the 98,000 suspected noncitizen voters identified by the Texas Secretary of State in Monday\u2019s list live in counties that voted Democrat in the 2018 U.S. Senate election.\n\nAs the slow-moving debacle over the suspected noncitizen voter probe moves forward with the governor\u2019s blessing, naturalized citizens across the state are left wondering if their voter registrations will be questioned before the next election deadline on April 6.\n\nNaturalized Citizens Left In Limbo\n\nMar\u00eda Garc\u00eda was born in Durango, Mexico, but has lived in the United States since she was 3 months old. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen last May \u2015 in time to cast her first ballot in November\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI was super excited, but I was also very nervous,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how fast the system picks up on the registration. I had tried to confirm \u2015 I was checking on the site every day. When I showed up at the polling booth, I had the little receipt that you get. I had any type of documentation they would possibly ask for.\u201d\n\nWith the deadline to register for the next Texas election only three months away, she now worries that the state\u2019s faulty probe might leave her sitting out the next election \u2015 not only because she is recently naturalized but also because her name might get confused with someone else\u2019s.\n\nI know there are other people who might receive these letters and might receive these calls, and they\u2019ll think they did something wrong and they\u2019ll be scared to vote again. Julieta Garibay, naturalized citizen flagged in Texas voter probe\n\n\u201cMy name is Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, which is the most Latino name to have,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that going to put me at risk for the next elections coming up? We have mayoral elections in Dallas coming up and local positions that are important to me.\u201d\n\nJulieta Garibay of Austin also voted for the first time last year after naturalizing. Fearing the secretary of state might have flagged her, she sent an email to the Travis County voter registrar.\n\nBy Wednesday she got the answer. A county election official called to confirm the list included her name. The official didn\u2019t ask whether Garibay was a citizen.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the county is contesting her registration. Officials in Travis County have already struck 634 people from the list of 4,558 suspected noncitizen voters provided by the state and are investigating further, spokeswoman Tiffany Seward said. Officials aren\u2019t contacting voters about the list yet unless they ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling really mad,\u201d Garibay told HuffPost. \u201cI know there are other people who might receive these letters and might receive these calls, and they\u2019ll think they did something wrong and they\u2019ll be scared to vote again.\u201d\n\nSam Levine contributed reporting.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rand-paul-damages-neighbor-attack_us_5c52434ee4b0ca92c6dd143e": "Sen.

In 2018 he called for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending. In neither year did his White House deliver a detailed infrastructure proposal to Capitol Hill.\n\nIn 2017 his White House suggested taking $200 billion from other programs and somehow leveraging that with private-sector money to total $1 trillion, but never made any serious legislative proposal.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Monday that her guest for the State of the Union would be Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist who was furloughed during the shutdown.\n\nPesiri-Dybvik\u2019s husband is an air traffic controller and was required to work without pay during the lapse in appropriations. The family\u2019s home burned down in the 2017 Thomas fire.\n\n\u201cSince the tragic loss of their home, Trisha, Jed, and their three children have worked diligently to bounce back and reestablish a sense of normalcy in their lives, even amidst an unnecessary government shutdown that caused both of them to miss their paychecks for over a month,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said Monday that she had invited Frank Lagunas, an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, to attend Trump\u2019s address. Lagunas works as a project manager for the EPA\u2019s Superfund division and was furloughed during the recent shutdown.\n\n\u201cI want to show President Trump how his hostage-taking of American workers has a continuing impact on the lives of every day citizens, especially those who are dedicated to the public good,\u201d Schakowsky said in a release.\n\nTrump is set to deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had earlier asked him to postpone the speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, until the shutdown was over. When he initially refused to do so, she said she would not take the necessary steps to allow the address to proceed.\n\nAfter Trump announced a plan on Jan. 25 to reopen the government for three weeks, Pelosi invited him to deliver the address on Feb. 5.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, Trump has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.\n\nPesiri-Dybvik said in a statement that federal workers feel added stress because of \u201cthe looming uncertainty of another potential shutdown.\u201d\n\nIn his announcement about reopening the government, Trump promised that federal employees who had been affected by the shutdown would get backpay \u201cvery quickly or as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBut workers like Lila Johnson, a general cleaning services contractor at the Department of Agriculture, probably won\u2019t see any lost wages. Many government contractors \u2015 from food workers and janitors to security services and computer software developers \u2015 were also furloughed or received stop-work orders during the shutdown. But unlike federal employees, they likely won\u2019t receive backpay.\n\nJohnson will join Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) at the SOTU address, his office said.\n\n\u201cLow- and middle-wage federal contract workers who were locked out of their jobs during the shutdown have been stuck with mounting bills and no back pay,\u201d Van Hollen said in a statement.\n\nVan Hollen and Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) last month introduced the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act to ensure government contractors are paid for lost wages due to the shutdown.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the Senator inviting me to join him for the State of the Union to highlight the need for federal service contractors to be treated fairly,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI know he is fighting for us, and I\u2019m grateful for his efforts.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/west-virginia-teachers-announce-another-statewide-strike_n_5c6b4eafe4b0e8eb46b8f80e": "Craig Hudson/Charleston Gazette-Mail via ASSOCIATED PRESS With his fist raised, Fred Albert, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, joins other union leaders in a call for a statewide strike beginning Tuesday.\n\nWest Virginia public school teachers plan to go on strike again Tuesday, nearly a year to the day after they began a historic walkout that inspired teacher strikes in other states.\n\nThe unions representing teachers and other school personnel announced the new work stoppage Monday night at the statehouse in Charleston, as the GOP-controlled state Senate debated an education bill that teachers say would siphon money away from public schools.\n\nThe legislation would grant school personnel another raise, but it would also introduce charter schools in West Virginia and create a limited number of \u201ceducation savings accounts,\u201d using public money to reimburse families for private school costs.\n\nMany teachers have called the bill retaliation for their actions last year, when they drew national attention for demanding more school funding and higher pay.

They used a procedural maneuver to clear a committee when it became clear they didn\u2019t have the votes.\n\nTeachers have \u201cwatched the actions of the Senate, and it\u2019s like the matador with the red cape,\u201d Randolph said.

The Republican-led state Legislature has other ideas.\n\nThe Utah Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would toss out a grassroots-driven, voter-backed ballot initiative to offer Medicaid benefits to any Utahn earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000 a year for a single person), paid for by raising the sales tax on certain goods from 4.7 percent to 4.85 percent.\n\nThe legislation instead would expand Medicaid to fewer people, enable Utah to receive less federal money for the program and impose limitations on benefits, including work requirements. And the entire plan hinges on a dubious promise of federal approval for aspects of the state Senate bill.\n\nThe Utah GOP clearly is prioritizing overturning the voters, considering the Legislature has been in session since just Monday and the bill made it out its Senate committee Tuesday and to the floor Wednesday. The fact that 53 percent of voters spoke in favor of a full Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in November is not swaying Utah Republican legislators, who have resisted the expansion since it became available in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative, known as Proposition 3, not only received majority support statewide but also in most state Senate districts, the Utah Health Policy Project reported. According to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis of the vote Wednesday, 10 Republican senators representing districts where a majority voted in favor of the expansion are supporting the bill to modify it, including the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Allen Christensen. A plurality of Utahns opposes changing the voter-backed policy, according to a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defer to the will of the people at some point,\u201d said state Rep. Brian King, the minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives and one of 16 Democrats in the 75-member lower chamber of the Utah State Legislature. \u201cWe should not be doing anything to substantively alter that Proposition 3 in a way that delays the implementation one more day.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill sends a message to voters, King said: \u201cWe don\u2019t really care what the people of the state of Utah want to do or say they want us to do at the Legislature. We\u2019re going to do what we want to do. That\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d\n\nThese actions by Utah Republican lawmakers are reminiscent of how then-Gov. Paul LePage (R) defied Maine voters last year by refusing to carry out a Medicaid expansion they approved in 2017. LePage\u2019s successor, Gov. Janet Mills (D), has already begun the process of implementing the expansion. In Idaho, where voters also passed a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, a conservative organization is challenging it before the state Supreme Court.\n\nEfforts by Republicans at the state level to undo or limit the Medicaid expansion, including the seven states that received federal approval for work requirements and the eight more seeking it, mirror the national Republican strategy on health care.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress devoted most of 2017 to attempting and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with plans that would have left millions without health coverage. And in December, a federal judge ruled in favor of 20 GOP state officials who argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in a lawsuit supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nRick Bowmer/Associated Press Tiffiny Malo, left, and Pam Harrison, supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid, at a rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law during the first day of the Utah Legislature on Monday.\n\nThe Utah Senate must vote again on the bill to significantly alter the Medicaid expansion enacted by voters, which it approved once this week against the opposition of all six Democratic senators and one of the chamber\u2019s 23 Republicans. The state House is poised to act quickly on the legislation after the Senate is finished.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving very quickly,\u201d said King, who expects the Utah House will pass the Senate bill by the end of next week.\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert has not taken a public position on the Medicaid bill. In response to questions from HuffPost, Herbert\u2019s office provided a statement from a spokesman.\n\n\u201cGov. Herbert has long supported the kind of common-sense guardrails for Medicaid expansion that are being discussed in the legislature. Many were components of his proposed Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion in 2015; most of these were part of legislation that he signed into law last general session. His primary concerns are that the state honor the will of the voters to fill the hole in the social safety net by helping those under the poverty line without health insurance and to implement without delay,\u201d Paul Edwards said in the statement.\n\nLast week, Herbert said he believed the state should allow the expansion to move forward as approved by voters and then be revisited at a later date. During his State of the State address Thursday, Herbert said only that \u201cthe much-needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay.\u201d\n\nBecause Republicans have supermajorities in the Utah House and Senate, however, the GOP would have the votes to override a veto even if Herbert decided to oppose the Medicaid legislation.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and the federal government finances at least 90 percent of the cost. This expansion was meant to be in place nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate. To date, 14 states have declined it. Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voters all approved expansion via ballot initiative last year, but the program is not yet in place in those states. Under the terms of the Utah initiative, benefits are supposed to become available April 1.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative was straightforward in its approach by simply instructing the state to join the Medicaid expansion without any changes to the state\u2019s existing program or the need for federal approval. The Utah Governor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget assessed that the sales tax increase would raise more than enough money to finance the state\u2019s 10 percent share of the expansion\u2019s cost, although it noted that the revenue and costs in future years may not match up.\n\nBy contrast, the Utah Senate bill would trigger a complicated and uncertain process that would cover fewer people under Medicaid. The Senate began action on the measure before the Legislature\u2019s budget scorekeepers could analyze the legislation\u2019s effects, but it is designed to limit the Medicaid expansion\u2019s reach. That\u2019s despite the fact that the measure would leave the sales tax increase in place while also imposing a tax on hospitals that alone is intended to be large enough to cover the state\u2019s entire share of the expense of Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder the Senate legislation, Medicaid benefits would be available only to those with incomes below the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person. Utahns with incomes higher than that would continue to have access to subsidized private coverage via the health insurance exchange in the state. Unlike the Medicaid expansion voters approved, the state would receive about 70 percent of the funding for the partial Medicaid expansion from the federal government instead of the 90 percent offered by a full expansion.\n\nThe bill lacks detail on many key elements of the modified expansion, leaving those to the state\u2019s executive branch and federal officials to hash out. In order to maintain April 1 as the day benefits would come online, legislative Republicans are counting on all of that happening on an extraordinarily expedited basis.\n\n\u201cThis entire thing is being rammed through the Senate and the House as quickly as possible. It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters, that they\u2019re disrespecting voters by doing so,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a Washington-based organization that supported Medicaid ballot initiatives in Utah, Idaho, Maine, Montana and Nebraska over the past two years.\n\nIt is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project\n\nThe Herbert administration would have to resolve all the outstanding questions the bill poses and the federal government would have to approve waivers for standard Medicaid rules in less than two months, which is much more quickly than it typically acts.\n\n\u201cNothing about how the federal government moves and operates gives me much hope or assurance that you\u2019re going to get a waiver at all, much less one in a time frame that is going to be less than 60 days,\u201d King said.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty pertains to the funding. Under the legislation, Utah would ask the federal government to break precedent by providing the full 90 percent funding for a partial expansion. The Trump administration last year rejected such requests from Arkansas and Massachusetts, following the Obama administration\u2019s policy against partial expansions.\n\nUtah has even tried this before. Herbert signed legislation last year approving a partial expansion and submitted a request for approval to federal authorities. That would have covered about half as many people as a full Medicaid expansion. The state withdrew its application after the ballot initiative passed.\n\nThe new bill also calls for work requirements and for locking out enrollees who fail to meet them, but it does not specify what they would be and how they would be enforced. It also would cap enrollment for otherwise eligible Utahns if cost projections for the expansion exceed the amount of money appropriated for the year.\n\nThe attempt to overturn voters on Medicaid expansion comes a month after Herbert signed legislation to replace a medical marijuana initiative voters approved last year with a new law. In the aftermath of voters passing the marijuana and Medicaid measures, Utah lawmakers also are eying changes to the ballot initiative process to let the Legislature alter voter-backed policies before they take effect.\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from a spokesman for Utah Gov.

About 58,000 of them had cast a ballot over the last two decades. Those numbers came from an investigation that began a year ago, according to a news release. By Sunday, President Donald Trump had given the allegations of rampant voter fraud a massive megaphone, calling it \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be stopped!\u201d the president said on Twitter.\n\nThe Texas secretary of state\u2019s office declined multiple requests for comment. But Whitley\u2019s allegations crumble under minimal scrutiny.\n\nThe list culled by the secretary of state resulted from cross-checks with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues drivers licenses and public identification cards. But because DPS is a state agency, it doesn\u2019t keep reliable citizenship records \u2015 it only asks for proof of citizenship when people apply for state IDs. If someone becomes naturalized after obtaining a driver\u2019s license, which happens frequently, that new citizen isn\u2019t required to check back in to let the state know of the change. An estimated 1 million foreign-born Texans have been naturalized since 1996, and a majority of the state\u2019s immigrant population was born in Latin America.\n\nThe lack of evidence behind allegations that Attorney General Ken Paxton branded with the words \u201cVOTER FRAUD ALERT\u201d in a tweet has drawn condemnation from legal and advocacy groups.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office upped the number of suspect noncitizen voters to 98,000 on Monday. There were immediate signs that the lists were flawed. Lisa Wise, the top election official in El Paso County, told HuffPost that a naturalized co-worker was on the list. By Tuesday, the secretary of state\u2019s office had begun calling counties to alert them to mistakes on the lists it sent out, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nThe timing of the crackdown has also fueled concern about ulterior political motivations.\n\nFor more than two decades, Republicans have held firm control over Texas government, often winning statewide races by margins of 20 percentage points or more. That accomplishment is notable in a majority-minority state, where voters of color skew Democratic. The main reason why Texas demographics haven\u2019t ruptured GOP control is that the state\u2019s voter turnout is among the lowest in the nation, with Latinos in particular turning out at rates far below Anglos, who skew Republican.\n\nNovember\u2019s midterm elections upended that dynamic.\n\nA surge in turnout across the state narrowed Republican Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s margin of victory to just 2.7 percentage points. Justin Nelson, with little funding and less press, came within 3.6 points of ousting Republican Ken Paxton as the state\u2019s attorney general. Democrats picked up a dozen seats in the Texas House, and several of the most conservative politicians either lost or saw their margins of victory dwindle.\n\n\u201cTexas is trending certainly in a purple direction,\u201d Nelson, the Austin lawyer who attempted to unseat Paxton, told HuffPost. \u201cInstead of working to appeal to all Texans, the strategy is to try to intimidate and purge.\u201d\n\nSeveral factors account for the spike in turnout across the board \u2015 controversy over Trump, long-term efforts by nonprofits to boost Latino turnout and an underdog campaign by former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke to unseat Cruz.\n\nThe precise role that Latino turnout played in those results won\u2019t be clear until the U.S. census\u2019 American Community Survey is released, which normally comes out in the spring. But turnout more than doubled compared with the last midterm election in several border counties, where the population is overwhelmingly Latino and largely votes Democratic.\n\nTurnout in Texas was driven by majority-Latino counties in 2018 pic.twitter.com/ueLBzFYEz5 \u2014 Latino Decisions (@LatinoDecisions) November 15, 2018\n\n\u201cWe should be very cautious with accepting this information from the state, especially after a surge in Latino voter turnout,\u201d Cristina Tzintz\u00fan, director of Jolt, a Latino youth voter mobilization group, told HuffPost. \u201cThere should be a thorough investigation about why this data came out now, how it was produced, if it was accurately produced and why it came out so close to an election when we had such high Latino turnout.\u201d\n\nTexas demographics make it all but certain that the list contains mostly Hispanic names. Several Spanish surnames are very common, and state authorities often incorrectly enter compound last names into databases, which critics say increases the likelihood of falsely matching a U.S. citizen\u2019s name to a noncitizen\u2019s.\n\nTexas Republicans have been on a mission for over a decade to cast more scrutiny on voter registrations. In 2011, the state passed a sweeping voter ID law that required people to present photo identification before casting a ballot. A federal judge later curbed the law\u2019s implementation, but Texas still requires voters to either present one of several forms of photo ID or a document proving that obtaining one imposed an unnecessary burden.\n\nWe should be very cautious with accepting this information from the state, especially after a surge in Latino voter turnout. Cristina Tzintz\u00fan, director of Jolt\n\nThe efforts to impose stricter vetting of registered voters are still alive in the Texas Legislature and reflect the secretary of state\u2019s logic. State Rep. Mike Lang (R-Granbury) filed a bill in November that would set into law the flawed process of cross-checking registrations with DPS and give voters 60 days to prove their citizenship after receiving a letter from the secretary of state\u2019s office or be dropped from rolls.\n\nIf the bill were to pass in its current form, it would violate the National Voter Registration Act, according to Nina Perales, the vice president of litigation for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\n\u201cOur bill seeks to codify basically what they\u2019re seeking to do internally,\u201d Lang\u2019s chief of staff, Zach Maxwell, told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019re still pushing it.\u201d\n\nMaxwell acknowledged that the secretary of state\u2019s list does not prove any wrongdoing and that cross-checks with DPS would lead to false positives, likely placing additional burdens on naturalized citizens. Lang is open to revising that provision of the bill, he said.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are potential situations where there could be false positives, but at the same time we do know that there is a hole in the system,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be as fair as possible. We have due process in this country. You are innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nBut Friday\u2019s announcement takes the battle over voter registration requirements out of the Legislature and puts it in the hands of state agencies, where Democratic lawmakers have less ability to debate them.\n\nTexas Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda (D-Dallas) has examined the issue of voter fraud in the past and concluded that it does occur but that cases are isolated and rare.

A 24-page indictment alleges that Stone was in contact with WikiLeaks (referred to as \u201cOrganization 1\u201d) and communicated with senior Trump campaign officials about information that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton. One of Stone\u2019s attorneys entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.\n\nStone was arrested at his home in Florida early Friday. His appearance at U.S. District Court in the nation\u2019s capital on Tuesday generated a circuslike atmosphere outside the court, where supporters and detractors faced off near an inflatable mashup of Trump and a rat. Stone was released on the same conditions set by a federal judge in Florida: a $250,000 bond and an order restricting his travel and contact with witnesses.\n\nThe indictment against Stone suggests that Trump aides were in frequent talks about WikiLeaks and its release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails during the 2016 race. Mueller\u2019s team alleges that Stone repeatedly talked with high-ranking campaign officials about WikiLeaks and even received a text saying \u201cwell done\u201d after the organization released its first batch of emails.\n\nThe indictment also states that in addition to discussing WikiLeaks with campaign officials, Stone instructed radio host Randy Credico to lie in a grand jury testimony and threatened his therapy dog.\n\nStone has loudly and repeatedly defended himself since his arrest. He went on a tour of television talk shows to accuse the special counsel of fabricating charges against him and claimed he would be \u201cacquitted and vindicated.\u201d\n\nTrump has come to Stone\u2019s defense, tweeting on Friday that the investigation is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and promoting a conspiracy theory that the FBI tipped off CNN about the arrest.\n\nStone\u2019s indictment is the biggest development in months related to the Mueller investigation.

Manufacturers or retailers could also charge a fee for disabling it, according to the bill. Anyone who deactivates the blocker themselves would face a misdemeanor charge.\n\nThe money collected by the state, according to the proposal, would form a number of grants, which would, among other things, help sex abuse victims and fund the president\u2019s proposed border wall.\n\nPete Marovich via Getty Images The government Tuesday is in its 32nd day of a partial shutdown, as President Donald Trump and Democratic lawmakers continue to butt heads over his demand for funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe bill defines pornographic content as \u201cpatently offensive\u201d material that lacks \u201cliterary, artistic, political or scientific value.\u201d It references the banning of \u201crevenge porn\u201d websites and addresses specific anatomical areas that cannot be visible in images:\n\nLess than completely and opaquely covered human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola [and] human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, whether covered or uncovered.\n\nMike Stabile, a spokesman for the Free Speech Coalition, told the Arizona Mirror the proposal amounts to a tax on media content and would violate the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clearly unconstitutional,\u201d said Stabile, whose organization advocates for the adult entertainment industry.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Arizona Senator Gail Griffin (R-Hereford) is reportedly the only sponsor of the newly proposed bill.\n\nSimilar bills have been proposed, including one last year by GOP Virginia state Rep. Dave LaRock, who wanted Virginians to pay a $20 fee to unblock content on adult websites. The bill stalled on the Senate floor.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Mirror, the bill appears to be linked to a man named Chris Sevier. Last year, Sevier was reportedly issued a cease and desist by child safety activist Elizabeth Smart, who apparently did not approve of him using her name on a similar bill introduced in Rhode Island.\n\nSevier first made headlines in 2013, when he accused Apple of being responsible for his porn addiction. He was in the news again in 2017, when he sued Utah for refusing to recognize his marriage to his laptop. The lawsuit was thrown out last year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing this all across the country,\u201d Stabile told the Arizona Mirror, adding \u201che\u2019s a bit of a jokester.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-stone-indictment-revelations_us_5c4b1846e4b0e1872d42f0bc": "Federal agents stormed Roger Stone\u2019s Florida home before dawn Friday, arresting the longtime Republican strategist on charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Meanwhile, officials were spotted seizing materials from Stone\u2019s apartment in Manhattan.\n\nA federal grand jury convened by Mueller indicted Stone on seven counts relating to communications with WikiLeaks, the Russia-connected outfit that released material stolen in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee servers.\n\nStone, an eccentric veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, was instrumental in President Donald Trump\u2019s early campaign effort. He continued to serve as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign after departing in August 2015, and is known to have the ear of the president.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone spoke with unnamed \u201csenior Trump campaign officials\u201d about materials WikiLeaks had that could be damaging to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The 24-page indictment accuses Stone of obstructing investigations by congressional intelligence committees and the FBI, making false statements and tampering with a witness.\n\nHere are some of the indictment\u2019s wildest parts:\n\nStone evoked \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d as he pressured someone else with knowledge of the WikiLeaks hack to lie to Congress.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone worked hard to prevent an unnamed individual \u2015 referred to as Person 2 in the indictment but identified through context as radio host Randy Credico \u2015 from contradicting testimony that Stone gave before the House intelligence committee in September 2017. Stone lied to the committee about discussions he had about WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC hack, the indictment says, and the committee wished to speak to Credico two months later.\n\nThe two men apparently discussed a scene from \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d in which the mobster Frank Pentangeli pretends to be ignorant of certain information.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn multiple occasions, including on or about December 1, 2017, STONE told Person 2 that Person 2 should do a \u201cFrank Pentangeli\u201d before HPSCI in order to avoid contradicting STONE\u2019s testimony. Frank Pentangeli is a character in the film The Godfather: Part II, which both STONE and Person 2 had discussed, who testifies before a congressional committee and in that testimony claims not to know critical information that he does in fact know.\n\n... He also suggested emulating Richard Nixon.\n\nWhen Credico texted Stone about the House intelligence committee\u2019s request for voluntary testimony in November, Stone, who worked for Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, quoted his former boss.\n\nHe wrote: \u201d\u2018Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan\u2019 ... Richard Nixon.\u201d When Credico told Stone that he was facing a subpoena, Stone pressed him to assert his 5th Amendment rights \u2015 and he did.\n\nIn related news, many photos of Stone\u2019s Nixon back tattoo emerged Friday on Twitter.\n\nCan\u2019t decide which is more disturbing, the tattoo, the fact that Nixon picture is so much bigger than Reagan, or that this now indicted guy is a close confidant and adviser to the current President of the greatest nation on earth. pic.twitter.com/myElSrq3vI \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 25, 2019\n\nAnd Stone threatened a dog.\n\nThe relationship between Stone and Credico subsequently took a downward turn, with Stone threatening the radio host\u2019s dog, Bianca.\n\n\u201cPrepare to die,\u201d Stone wrote.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn or about April 9, 2018, STONE wrote in an email to Person 2, \u201cYou are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds.\u201d STONE also said he would \u201ctake that dog away from you,\u201d referring to Person 2\u2019s dog. On or about the same day, STONE wrote to Person 2, \u201cI am so ready. Let\u2019s get it on. Prepare to die [expletive].\u201d\n\nA Trump campaign official \u201cwas directed\u201d to get in touch with Stone about the hack.\n\nThe indictment does not name specific Trump campaign officials or suggest what Trump himself may have known about Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks. But if an already \u201csenior\u201d official \u201cwas directed\u201d to contact Stone, few would presumably have the authority to do such directing.\n\nThe Trump campaign was very interested in what WikiLeaks may have mined from DNC servers.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nAfter the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.\n\nSomeone with knowledge of the DNC hack suggested putting out the message that Clinton was \u201cold, memory bad, has stroke.\u201d\n\nIn early August 2016, another person who knew about the WikiLeaks hack, referred to as Person 1, emailed Stone to say that the group planned two more information dumps. Right-wing author and birther conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Friday that the indictment referred to him.\n\n\u201cImpact planned to be very damaging,\u201d Corsi wrote, suggesting the Trump campaign push the idea that Clinton was in bad health. Trump himself peddled doubts about his opponent\u2019s health on the campaign trail, fueling a right-wing conspiracy theory.\n\nRyan Goodman, former special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense, said on Twitter that the idea could have \u201csignificant\u201d legal implications if it could be used to show coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nPerson 1 added in the same email, \u201cTime to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w 5 enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC. That appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke \u2013 neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for [Clinton] Foundation debacle.\u201d\n\nThe day Stone swore he had not texted or emailed with \u201cPerson 2,\u201d the two men exchanged 30 texts.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the very day Stone testified before the House intelligence committee that he never sent or received written communications with Credico, the pair \u201cexchanged over thirty text messages.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include Randy Credico\u2019s name as Person 2.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rodney-davis-flying-first-class-ggovernment-shutdown_us_5c477fe1e4b083c46d634be8": "WASHINGTON \u2015 With President Donald Trump and the GOP prolonging the partial government shutdown, a Republican lawmaker had an uncomfortable run-in Tuesday when a fellow airplane passenger found him flying first class from Chicago to Washington, D.C., according to a video of the encounter shared with HuffPost.\n\n\u201cCongressman, do you think it\u2019s appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren\u2019t being paid?\u201d the person says to Rep.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) speaks at the Iowa Women's March on Saturday in Des Moines. The speech was part of her first presidential campaign trip.\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2015 When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) walked into Sioux City Gifts on Friday afternoon, the store was virtually empty save for the dozen reporters who had tagged along to document her inaugural presidential campaign swing.\n\nBut after greeting the cashier, Gillibrand spied a lone patron \u2015 visibly stunned to be surrounded by the media entourage \u2015 and immediately introduced herself.\n\nThe customer, Diane Desy, 55, a local retail worker and avid Republican, told Gillibrand she was concerned about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGillibrand asked whether Desy would support comprehensive immigration reform combining, among other things, tougher border security with a pathway to citizenship for those undocumented immigrants already in the country.\n\nDesy responded favorably and the two got to talking about veterans issues. By the time Gillibrand moved on to inspect the store\u2019s photography studio, she had made a dent in Desy\u2019s lifelong allegiance to the GOP.\n\nAlthough the woman said she has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and is relatively satisfied with President Donald Trump, she told reporters she would at least give Gillibrand serious consideration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impressed with her,\u201d Desy said. \u201cI lean more conservative, but I\u2019m not close-minded to other points of view.\u201d\n\nGillibrand, a 52-year-old attorney and 10-year Senate member who announced her presidential run on Wednesday, couldn\u2019t have found a better case study for her presidential pitch if she had invented one from scratch. And sure enough, she referenced Desy \u2015 anonymously \u2015 in virtually every subsequent speech she delivered on the stump in all-important Iowa \u2015 from Boone to Des Moines.\n\nWhile registered Republicans like Desy won\u2019t decide who gets to take on Trump in the 2020 general election, a key part of Gillibrand\u2019s pitch to her fellow Democrats is that she has a record of winning over more conservative voters in rural areas.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images Gillibrand, surrounded by Republican senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas, speaks in 2013 about legislation on dealing with sexual assault in the military. She has touted her ability to work with conservatives.\n\n\u2018I Can Work With Anybody\u2019\n\nOver the course of a 36-hour tour of northwestern and central Iowa on Friday and Saturday, Gillibrand frequently mentioned how much the wintry, agriculture-heavy state reminded her of upstate New York \u2015 the region where she grew up and with her husband raises their two sons.\n\n\u201cI kind of recognize you, because you are hardy and you are hardworking and you don\u2019t give up. It\u2019s a lot like upstate New York Democrats,\u201d she told a capacity crowd of hundreds at the Peace Tree Brewing Co. outlet in Des Moines on Saturday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind the cold, either.\u201d\n\nI kind of recognize you, because you are hardy and you are hardworking and you don\u2019t give up. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)\n\nGillibrand began her political career by upsetting a GOP incumbent in a 2006 House race in a district where Republicans outnumbered Democrats 2 to 1. She recalled to her Iowa listeners that one skeptical consultant claimed the district had \u201cmore cows than Democrats,\u201d and she cited her win as evidence of her ability to prevail in hostile territory.\n\nBut in recounting that first foray into electoral politics, she also was careful to emphasize stances from that run that liberal voters would agree with: opposition to the Iraq War and support for what Gillibrand calls \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (though her plan might more accurately be described as a Medicare buy-in or public option).\n\nThe voters she wooed in that initial race \u201ccared about a lot of the same things you might have cared about \u2015 that rank-and-file Democrats cared about,\u201d Gillibrand said.\n\nShe even managed to make the case that her subsequent Senate wins in New York, a solid blue state in presidential voting, had further honed her political skills. She noted that outside of New York City, the state largely consists of moderate \u201cpurple\u201d and conservative \u201cred\u201d pockets.\n\nIn early 2009, Gillibrand was the surprise gubernatorial pick to temporarily fill the Seate seat Hillary Clinton gave up to become then-President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nGillibrand easily won a 2010 special election for the seat, and in 2012 she won a full term with 72 percent of the vote \u2015 which she told Iowa voters is the highest tally for any statewide candidate in New York history. (In her 2018 re-election win,she picked up 67 percent of the vote, losing many of the rural counties she carried in 2012.)\n\nAt her brewery appearance, Gillibrand appeared to hit her stride rhetorically, letting her sense of humor flow a little more freely than at her previous stops as she spoke against the backdrop of stacked beer barrels.\n\nA joke she had made elsewhere got bigger laughs than before.\n\n\u201cI work with [Sen.] Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on ending sexual harassment in Congress. I can work with anybody,\u201d she said, prompting hoots of laughter and then applause from the crowd.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Nati Harnik Gillibrand greets voters at the Pierce Street Coffee Works caf\u00e9 in Sioux City, Iowa, on Friday. At that stop and others, she pitched herself as a Democrat capable of attracting support from rural voters who could prove crucial to Democratic hopes of winning the White House in 2020.\n\n\u2018Not A National Name\u2019\n\nGillibrand has the challenge \u2015 and perhaps the benefit \u2015 of entering the presidential race with relatively little national name recognition. It\u2019s a reality that she noted at the close of a well-attended question-and-answer session on Saturday at a coffee shop in Ames, thanking local Democrats for showing up even though she is \u201cnot a national name.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one reason why Gillibrand barely registered in a mid-December poll of Iowa Democrats about their preferred presidential candidates in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. (Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both of whom are considering presidential bids, took first and second place, respectively.)\n\nBut it also gives her the chance to shape her brand with voters without having to undo any major preconceived notions about her.\n\nAnd Gillibrand\u2019s argument that her success in rural areas \u2015 as well as in suburbs \u2015 makes her uniquely equipped to take on Trump attempts to turn what may be her greatest liability into a selling point.\n\nThe more conservative stances she took on guns and immigration in the first stages of her political career have prompted scrutiny. In her first House race, she tried to outflank her Republican opponent from the right when it came to cracking down illegal immigration. She also earned an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association for her support of gun rights. (As recently as February 2009, she boasted of keeping two guns under her bed.)\n\nIn Iowa, Gillibrand parried queries about her past stances without getting flustered, chalking up her evolution to more progressive positions to insights she gained upon becoming a senator.\n\nShe is a workhorse in the Senate and that\u2019s one thing I do appreciate. Jefferson Fink, Des Moines voter\n\nResponding to a question from a Democratic activist in Sioux City on Friday about why the NRA once considered her an ally in the fight against greater gun regulation, she grew emotional describing how meeting the parents of a teenager in Brooklyn killed by gun violence helped change her mind about the need to toughen firearm laws. It\u2019s part of what inspired her, she said, to back 2011 legislation cracking down on illegal gun trafficking.\n\n\u201cSince [meeting those parents] 10 years ago, I have been 100 percent trying to end gun violence. I proudly have an \u2018F\u2019 rating from the NRA,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowd responded with approving applause.\n\nBernie Scolaro, a Sioux City public school teacher, was the only Democrat over the course of the trip who told HuffPost that she associated Gillibrand with the successful effort to pressure former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken (D) to resign in December 2017. Gillibrand was the first senator to call for Franken to leave after he faced multiple accusations of unwanted groping and other sexual misconduct.\n\nFranken was popular as an effective Senate voice against Trump, and some Democratic donors have expressed anger that Gillibrand fueled the effort to oust him from office. But she has vehemently defended her action, noting that Franken had been accused credibly by eight women of misconduct when she called on him to resign.\n\nAs Gillibrand spoke at a house party, Scolaro asked the senator about her role in the Franken matter and the criticism it has sparked. Gillibrand replied that she spoke out because she believed she could no longer speak credibly to her teenage son about how to treat women respectfully if she did not act on those same principles in the U.S. Senate.\n\nScolaro seemed persuaded by the answer. \u201cShe was genuine and [Gillibrand\u2019s response] was from the heart,\u201d the woman said afterward.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Matthew Putney Leading Democrats are quickly lining up for presidential bids. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke in Des Moines shortly after announcing her intention to run.\n\nA Focus On Electability\n\nGillibrand is the second Senate Democrat to announce presidential ambitions \u2015 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) jumped into the race on Dec. 31. Those two are not expected to be the last; Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Corey Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are mulling candidacies. And as the party awaits the decisions by Biden and Sanders, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) jumped into the race earlier this month.\n\nUnlike many in what will be a crowded field, Gillibrand doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a particular ideological \u201clane.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of Sanders-style references to Nordic nations, Gillibrand cites her faith in God and the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d when explaining her support for policies like paid family leave. On a key education issue, she tends to stress making the acquisition of professional skills more affordable, rather than eliminating tuition at public colleges (though she has co-sponsored a bill that would do the latter for families making less than $125,000 annually).\n\nAt the same time, Gillibrand is leaning into her opposition to the influence of money in politics, calling for public financing of political campaigns. Like Warren, she has sworn off money from corporate political action committees and support from super PACs.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Gillibrand has gotten behind ambitious progressive policies and legislation in the last two years. She co-sponsored Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation in September 2017, and rolled out her own bill last May that aimed to put payday lenders out of business. In June, she came out in favor of abolishing ICE \u2015 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that has elicited notoriety for its aggressive raids against undocumented immigrants in the nation\u2019s interior.\n\nStill, Gillibrand appears to be betting that touting her electability is a way to distinguish herself among a likely raft of candidates whose populist bona fides are harder to assail.\n\nThat could be a potent formula for Democratic primary voters whose interest in finding a candidate with general-election viability \u2015 who first and foremost can beat Trump \u2015 seems only to have intensified since he took office.\n\n\u201cShe is a workhorse in the Senate and that\u2019s one thing I do appreciate,\u201d said Jefferson Fink, 28, who works at Kitchen Collage in downtown Des Moines. (Gillibrand stopped at the cooking specialty store on Saturday afternoon to bake cookies and discuss her family\u2019s culinary habits.)\n\nFink supported Sanders in Iowa\u2019s 2016 caucuses and he said he would be fine with him entering the race again.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) just proposed huge increases to the estate tax, which would reverse decades of cuts that have allowed the nation\u2019s richest to establish generations of wealth.\n\nSanders wants to tax billionaires at a top rate of 77 percent when they die, a massive increase from the current rate. His Thursday announcement of what he\u2019s calling the For The 99.8% Act came just days after Republican senators announced they wanted to repeal the estate tax wholesale.\n\nSanders said the bill would raise $2.2 trillion from the more than 500 people who are billionaires in the U.S. at a time when Democratic contenders for president seem to be in a race to one-up each other with new ways of getting the rich to pay their fair share. Sanders is expected to announce his candidacy for 2020 soon.\n\n\u201cOur bill does what the American people want by substantially increasing the estate tax on the wealthiest families in this country and dramatically reducing wealth inequality,\u201d Sanders said in a press release. \u201cFrom a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders is introducing a bill to increase the estate tax on the nation's billionaires to a rate of 77 percent.\n\nRepublicans have railed against the estate tax for years, calling it the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d It was drastically lowered during the George W. Bush administration\u2015 even disappearing for a time in 2010 \u2015 and cut again with the most recent GOP tax overhaul. On Monday, GOP Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and John Thune (S.D.) introduced legislation that would go even further: permanently eliminating the federal estate tax altogether.\n\nCurrently, assets worth more than $11.4 million are taxed at a maximum rate of 40 percent. As recently as 1976, the tax rate was 77 percent on assets of $10 million in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nSanders would like to get back there: Under his plan, estates between $3.5 million and $10 million would be taxed at 45 percent. After that, the tax rate would increase to 50 percent for assets of $10 million to $50 million and to 55 percent for assets between $50 million and $1 billion.\n\nAny assets above that would be taxed at a rate of 77 percent. Sanders said the bill would affect the richest 0.2 percent of earners.\n\nHis proposal is just the latest tax-the-rich idea coming from Democrats this year. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has announced a 2020 presidential run, has proposed an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on people with more than $50 million in assets \u2015 that\u2019s a levy the wealthy would pay while they\u2019re still living. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has said she wants to raise the top marginal tax rate on incomes over $10 million.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, the US led the world toward the development of progressive taxation and the reduction of inequality at the global level during the first half of the 20th century,\u201d Thomas Piketty, an economist known for his work on wealth inequality, told HuffPost in an email about Warren\u2019s proposal. \u201cUnfortunately, one century later, in 2019, the rise of inequality creates new threats to liberal democracies. It is time to take a new step and to develop new policy instruments, in line with the challenges raised by global wealth trends. \u201c\n\nOcasio-Cortez has also taken a moral stand against the existence of billionaires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that Bill Gates or Warren Buffett are immoral, but a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don\u2019t have access to public health is wrong,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nAs wealth concentration is surging in the United States, it is high time to revive the estate tax, plug the loopholes, and make it more progressive. Emmanuel Saez, a supporter of Sanders' estate tax proposal\n\nHoward Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO who is now mulling a run for president as an independent candidate, has taken on the duty of publicly defending his fellow billionaires from political attacks. At a Monday event in Manhattan, he called Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s recent criticism of billionaires \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cmisinformed.\u201d Then on Tuesday, he described Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018ridiculous,\u2019\u201d Warren responded, \u201cis billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 proposal also would get rid of some of the tax shelters and dodges that the wealthy use to get out of paying the estate tax. That move echoes policy proposals from Warren and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Each has included reforms to estate tax loopholes as funding mechanisms for other legislative proposals.\n\nFiguring out how to raise taxes on the rich is shaping up to be one of the core pieces of the Democratic primary, said Greg Leiserson, director of tax policy and senior economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. He\u2019s agnostic so far on the method, though. Any of the proposals could work, he said, adding: \u201cI think we should be taxing wealth more and I\u2019m excited to see these different approaches.\u201d\n\nSanders said his act already has the approval of economists including Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Robert Reich.\n\n\u201cAs wealth concentration is surging in the United States, it is high time to revive the estate tax, plug the loopholes, and make it more progressive.

Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential primaries. \u201cSo the only thing to conclude is that Trump is building a fake wall with fake pesos to stop fake caravans to prevent a fake border crisis for which he will declare another fake victory.\u201d\n\nThe president triggered a 35-day government shutdown just before Christmas over the refusal by the then wholly Republican-led Congress to appropriate billions of taxpayer dollars for his signature campaign promise.\n\nA week ago, he signed the exact short-term spending deal \u2015 with no wall money \u2015 that he said he would not sign in December. On Thursday, he said he did so to help the 800,000 federal workers who already had missed a month of pay. He claimed, without evidence, that \u201cmany\u201d of them had wanted him to continue the shutdown to get wall money.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to do it because people were getting hurt,\u201d Trump told reporters following an Oval Office photo opportunity.\n\nHe added that the shutdown had great value because it focused attention on the wall and illegal immigration. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do the shutdown, people wouldn\u2019t know, people wouldn\u2019t understand the subject,\u201d the president said. \u201cNow they understand the subject.

He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nNow, with the House under the control of Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is facing vocal opposition to his wall rather than just passive resistance. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday, but allowed that she is open to some new barriers in some areas as well as money for better technical monitoring. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nTrump made illegal immigration and caravans of asylum-seekers heading to the border the centerpiece of his midterm election message last year. In speech after speech, he told audiences at his rallies and those watching at home that the migrants would bring crime and drugs and that Pelosi wanted \u201copen borders\u201d and would welcome those people in.\n\nDespite his efforts \u2015 and in some congressional districts, because of them \u2015 Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House. Meanwhile, Republicans, although they had the most favorable Senate election map in decades, picked up only two seats in that chamber.\n\nAs a Dec. 21 government funding deadline approached, Trump resumed talking about caravans and immigrants coming to commit crimes \u2015 including one particularly lurid but apparently apocryphal description of kidnapped women being bound and gagged with duct tape as they\u2019re smuggled across the border.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters that he doubted the House and Senate conference committee negotiators working on a new Department of Homeland Security funding bill would include money for his wall. He acknowledged that he might yet declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d which he believes would let him transfer money from other executive agency accounts to build the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting till Feb. 15,\u201d Trump said, referring to the next shutdown deadline. \u201cOn Feb. 15, the committee will come back.

This is something to pay close attention to when primary voters really start tuning in to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: No consensus has developed among Democratic voters or party operatives over what type of candidate is best equipped to defeat Trump.\n\nShould it be a candidate who can win back the white working-class voters who defected to Trump in 2016? Then Democrats might want former Vice President Joe Biden, who is basing his potential candidacy around his appeal to that demographic. A candidate of color, like Texas\u2019 Juli\u00e1n Castro or California Sen. Kamala Harris, might be best equipped to win Republican-controlled Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona. Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have long argued that he would have won in 2016, and excitement around his policy platform could fire up working-class voters of all races.\n\nA report last month from Working America, an organizing group backed by the AFL-CIO, found \u201cwidespread anxiety and uncertainty about Democrats\u2019 prospects of defeating the president in 2020, and a lack of consensus on which candidate could best compete against Trump\u201d among working-class Democratic voters in Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe talk about electability was pervasive,\u201d Matt Morrison, Working America\u2019s executive director, told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThere was no clear consensus on what direction Democrats wanted to move in the presidential contest.\u201d\n\nContrast this focus on finding the most electable candidate with how people approached the 2016 election: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from shortly before the Iowa caucuses found just 16 percent of Democratic Party voters said choosing a candidate who could beat the GOP nominee was their top concern.\n\nElectability is already shaping early messaging on the 2020 primaries. For instance, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who both represent big cities on the East Coast, are playing up their rural roots, hoping to show Iowans they can win outside the most progressive parts of the country.\n\nThe consensus within both parties on who is electable and who isn\u2019t was torn apart by the results of the last presidential election, when Trump squeaked by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even as much of the GOP establishment predicted political doom. But while GOP primary voters seemingly responded to their party\u2019s presidential losses in 2008 and 2012 by throwing electability concerns out the window in 2016, Democratic primary voters in the 2018 midterms largely selected the same candidates that party bosses in Washington believed were most likely to win.\n\nThe Monmouth poll also found that 61 percent of Democratic women were willing to set aside their policy preferences to get a candidate capable of defeating the president, compared to just 45 percent of Democratic men.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-tax-proposal-is-even-popular-democrats-republicans_us_5c586722e4b09293b206d8bb": "Carlos Giusti/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Elizabeth Warren is making a wealth tax on Americans who are worth more than $50 million part of her 2020 presidential campaign agenda.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-Mass.) proposal for a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on Americans worth more than $50 million currently has significant support across party lines, new polling suggests.\n\nThe exact level of support varies from survey to survey. But in three recently released online polls, support for Warren\u2019s plan ranges between 50 and 61 percent, with opposition languishing between 20 and 23 percent.\n\nIn a new Politico/Morning Consult survey, 61 percent of voters favored \u201ca recent proposal to levy a new, 2 percent annual tax on all assets owned by households with a net worth of $50 million or more, and an additional 1 percent tax on households with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\u201d Just 20 percent were opposed, with the rest unsure. Democratic voters supported the plan by 74 percent to 11 percent, while Republican voters backed it by 50 percent to 30 percent. (The bipartisan support is particularly notable given that, earlier in the survey, the proposal was explicitly identified as Warren\u2019s.)\n\nIn the most recent Economist/YouGov poll, Americans said, 50 percent to 23 percent, that they supported \u201can annual 2% tax on net worth between $50 million and $1 billion and 3% tax above $1 billion,\u201d with 27 percent unsure. Democrats favored the idea by 63 percent to 14 percent, while Republicans supported it by a narrower 46 percent to 35 percent.\n\nIn a poll conducted by YouGov Blue for the progressive group Data for Progress (which supports the proposal), 61 percent of voters supported \u201cimposing a 2% tax on the assets of those with a net worth over $50 million and a 3% tax on the assets of those with a net worth over $1 billion,\u201d with 21 percent opposed and the rest neutral or unsure. Democrats supported the measure by an overwhelming 76 percent to 6 percent, and Republicans by a more modest 44 percent to 37 percent.\n\nWarren told Politico that she wasn\u2019t surprised the idea polled well and that she didn\u2019t anticipate backing away from the proposal if she won the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cI think I\u2019ve already lost the billionaire vote.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic tax proposal \u2015 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s plan for a 70 percent tax rate on income over $10 million \u2015 got less support but also polled above water in the Politico/Morning Consult survey (45 percent favoring, 32 percent opposing) and the Economist/YouGov survey (44 percent in favor, 33 percent opposed), with a third survey finding majority support.\n\nOpinions, of course, aren\u2019t set in stone, and views of proposals often become increasingly polarized over the course of the public debate. But more broadly, taxing the wealthy is an idea that seems to be playing well at the moment. In the Politico/Morning Consult survey, 63 percent of voters said \u201cupper income people\u201d pay too little in taxes. In a recent Fox News poll, voters said by a 46-percentage-point margin that they supported increasing tax rates on families making more than $10 million annually, and by a 36-point margin that they supported raising tax rates for those making upwards of $1 million.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kellyanne-conway-abortion-gun-joke_us_5c595a2be4b0871047572058": "\u201cI always love to say to those gender studies people, if you say \u2018abortion\u2019 or \u2018stem cells\u2019 or \u2018guns\u2019 one more time, I\u2019m going to perform one of those on you because, you know, with a gun, because you, by implication, are suggesting that women can\u2019t do the math.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politicians-react-trump-national-emergency_n_5c66e52fe4b01757c36b1b34": "Trump on Thursday said he would approve Congress\u2019 spending bill, which includes $1.375 billion for border barriers, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded.

The votes generally fell along party lines, with Republicans saying the hike would be too extreme, particularly in more rural areas.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker, the new Democratic governor, has already indicated he would sign what he called \u201chistoric legislation,\u201d saying $15 was an appropriate floor across the state.\n\nThe minimum wage in Illinois is currently $8.25 per hour. The bill would gradually raise it in installments, first to $9.25 next January, then to $10 next July, and then $1 each new year until 2025, when it would reach $15. Backers of the bill argued that the piecemeal increases would create less of a shock for employers having to pay the higher wages.\n\nChicago Tribune via Getty Images Many Democratic lawmakers have gotten onboard with the concept of a $15 minimum wage thanks to the Fight for $15, a union-backed worker campaign that began in the fast-food industry in 2012.\n\nThe legislation and the politics surrounding it are similar to what just happened in New Jersey, where a $15 plan was signed into law earlier this month. Democrats in both states previously controlled both chambers of the statehouse, but winning the governor\u2019s mansion as well has given them the opportunity to pass progressive laws over the objection of Republicans.\n\nPritzker, like Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in New Jersey, has said hiking the minimum wage would be a priority for his administration. His predecessor, Republican Bruce Rauner, vetoed a similar bill Democrats sent him in 2017.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers by and large have gotten onboard with the concept of a $15 minimum wage \u2015 a progressive pipe dream just a few years ago \u2015 thanks almost entirely to the Fight for $15, a union-backed worker campaign that began in the fast-food industry in 2012. The sight of McDonald\u2019s workers walking off the job in protest of low pay helped spur legislation and ballot initiatives in cities and states across the country.\n\nNow it seems there is little to stop $15 proposals in blue states where Democrats control the levers of government. Illinois is now on track to become the fifth state with a $15 floor, following California, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.\n\nEven so, the Illinois bill is not an unqualified victory for unions and worker groups. In a win for the service industry, the legislation does not touch what\u2019s known as the \u201ctip credit\u201d \u2015 the ability of restaurants and other gratuity-based businesses to pay a lower base minimum wage, letting tips make up the difference. The legislation will allow restaurants to continue paying 60 percent of the regular minimum wage.\n\nThat means the lower tipped minimum wage will go up over time, eventually to $9 when the regular minimum wage hits $15, but it won\u2019t be eliminated the way liberal groups have sought.\n\nEmployers can also pay a lower minimum wage to minors who work fewer than 650 hours annually, the equivalent of about 16 full-time weeks. That minimum wage will top out at $13, rather than $15, in 2025.\n\nRepublicans had also sought a lower minimum wage outside the more expensive Chicago area but didn\u2019t get it.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-special-counsel-robert-mueller-investigation_n_5c5c9891e4b03afe8d65ada3": "Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is ramping up after a midterm election hiatus \u2014 just as Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives.\n\nIt can all be a lot to keep up with. So here\u2019s your guide to what\u2019s happening with the Mueller probe and what comes next.\n\nAll right, so this is all about Russian interference in the 2016 election. What have we learned about that?\n\nA decent amount so far, but we don\u2019t yet have the full picture. Much of the media coverage of the Mueller investigation has focused on the Americans in Trump\u2019s orbit who have been caught up in the probe. But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media.\n\nOne reason those cases don\u2019t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there\u2019s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they\u2019re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments \u2014 one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 \u2014 are essential parts of the Mueller probe.\n\nThe first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system\u201d and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals \u2015 most of them military intelligence officers \u2015 \u201cconducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public.\n\nOK, other than all those Russians, who in Trump\u2019s circle has Mueller indicted?\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone.\n\nThere were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don\u2019t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn\u2019t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon.\n\nWho has the Mueller investigation found committed crimes?\n\nThe special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates.\n\nManafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial.\n\nIs anyone going to prison?\n\nPapadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat about Paul Manafort?\n\nManafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time.\n\nAfter he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller\u2019s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews \u2015 committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI.\n\nHow long has this Mueller probe been going on?\n\nMueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them \u2015 named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhen is the Mueller report coming out?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it\u2019s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It\u2019s unclear what form that would take.\n\nWhat kind of operation is Mueller running?\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty tight ship. There haven\u2019t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves).\n\nHow has Trump\u2019s legal team responded?\n\nBy getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI \u2015 generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization \u2015 was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau\u2019s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton\u2019s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election.\n\nAfter the Mueller probe wraps up, is that it?\n\nNo. There have been some clear signs that Mueller\u2019s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren\u2019t on Mueller\u2019s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it\u2019s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney\u2019s office without setting off a bunch of alarms.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump\u2019s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August.\n\nSo that\u2019s how Jeff Bezos\u2019 dick pics fit into all this?\n\nRight. The Enquirer published Bezos\u2019 intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos \u2014 the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn\u2019t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There\u2019s a question whether what he calls \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d violates AMI\u2019s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let\u2019s say, a complexifier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in everything?\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2015 based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public.\n\nRosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He\u2019s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed.\n\nWho is Matt Whitaker, and how the heck did he become Rosenstein\u2019s boss?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn\u2019t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush\u2019s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe.\n\nWhere does WikiLeaks fit in?\n\nA key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails\u2019 release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election.\n\nSome of the special counsel\u2019s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone.\n\nSo what is Roger Stone charged with, exactly?\n\nMueller\u2019s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel\u2019s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering.\n\nThe indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury \u2014 referring to a scene in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to \u2014 and threatened Credico\u2019s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIs there anyone else implicated in the Roger Stone indictment?\n\nThere\u2019s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted.\n\nDraft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year.\n\n\n\nGuess we should talk more about Michael Cohen\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress.\n\nHis indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization\u2019s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted.\n\nCohen told investigators that at Trump\u2019s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nWhat ended up happening with the Moscow Trump Tower?\n\nIt never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen\u2019s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with that secret Supreme Court battle?\n\nThis one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business \u2015 called \u201cCorporation\u201d from \u201cCountry A\u201d in court filings \u2015 trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the \u201cCorporation\u201d has to comply with the subpoena, but didn\u2019t explain its decision.\n\nAll this mystery could amount to nothing \u2015 it\u2019s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation.\n\nDoes it matter that the Democrats now control the House?\n\nIt does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe. This would also potentially help bring the Mueller investigation findings into the public eye if the White House or new attorney general attempts to suppress the report.\n\nIs Don Jr. going to prison?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. isn\u2019t currently facing any charges, so at least in the short term, the answer is no. But ever since the special counsel indicted Cohen for lying to Congress, there has been an increased focus on whether Trump Jr. could face similar charges.\n\nTrump Jr. told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that he never directly or indirectly sought foreign assistance for his dad\u2019s campaign. However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion. He held a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin. Days before the meeting, an intermediary emailed Trump Jr. to let him know that a senior Russian government official was offering to provide damaging information on Clinton.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-steve-king-committee-assignments_us_5c3d2cd2e4b0e0baf54058bc": "Republican leaders have stripped Rep.

In Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County, people stood in line for nearly five hours to vote.

Paul Ryan, who was then the speaker of the House, told Trump he saw no way for Republicans to win a standoff. And Kevin McCarthy, then the House majority leader, warned that a shutdown during the holiday season was a bad idea.\n\nTrump, nevertheless, pushed ahead, refusing to sign legislation to keep the government operating \u2015 unless he received money for his border wall, which during the campaign he said Mexico would pay for.\n\nRepublican leaders had good reason to be cautious about shutting down the government: The GOP would probably get blamed for it. Historically, the public tends to hold the Republican Party for such impasses.\n\n\u201cRepublicans usually get the blame for shutdowns because they usually cause the shutdowns, which is inevitable as they have become more controlled by their ideologically extreme members,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster with Greenberg Quinlan Rosner.\n\nTrump is learning this lesson now. The current shutdown is the longest in history, with no end in sight. He continues to insist on money for his border wall, while Democrats refuse to give it to him.\n\nThe public is blaming Trump for the mess, according to polls by HuffPost/YouGov and other news outlets. To be clear, no one in government comes out looking especially good during a shutdown, but he is being held responsible (as he once said he wanted to be).\n\nAlthough three Senate Republicans have called for the government to reopen, most are sticking by Trump \u2015 even despite the loss of public support.\n\n\u201cHe actually is moving the numbers in his direction compared to a year ago, in terms of the wall,\u201d Sen.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) added that \u201cthe president has moved further in trying to find a balance there than the other side has.\u201d\n\nVoters blamed congressional Republicans for a shutdown in 2013 (when the GOP wanted to extract concessions on killing Obamacare) and two from 1995 to 1996 (when President Bill Clinton refused to go along with GOP budget cuts).\n\nNewt Gingrich certainly didn\u2019t help his party gain support for the shutdowns in the 1990s. Gingrich, who was House speaker, was already unpopular. Then he indicated that he had shut down the government for a very personal reason: He felt Clinton snubbed him on a flight from Israel in November.\n\n\u201cThis is petty,\u201d Gingrich told reporters, according to a Nov. 17, 1995, article in The Washington Post. \u201c[But] you land at Andrews [Air Force Base] and you\u2019ve been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp. \u2026 You just wonder, where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy?\u201d\n\nClinton also effectively used his bully pulpit to shame Republicans, highlighting the personal toll of the shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. During his 1996 State of the Union address, he honored the service of Richard Dean, a heroic public servant who risked his life to save others during the Oklahoma City bombing the previous April. He was sat in the first lady\u2019s box for the address, and when Clinton honored Dean\u2019s service, the entire chamber applauded him. From Clinton\u2019s speech:\n\nI\u2019d like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who\u2019s worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the federal building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He re-entered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He\u2019s here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism.\n\nThen Clinton delivered his kicker: Dean had been furloughed during the shutdowns. Clinton\u2019s call for Congress to never again shut down the government received boisterous cheers from Democrats. Gingrich, meanwhile, sat awkwardly at the dais behind Clinton.\n\nBut Richard Dean\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time the government shut down, he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. On behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In his 1996 State of the Union speech, President Bill Clinton called out Republicans for shutting down the government.\n\nThe ensuing coverage declared Clinton\u2019s speech a success and panned the GOP response from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (Kan.). The San Jose Mercury News praised Clinton\u2019s \u201cconciliatory-sounding speech\u201d and criticized Dole\u2019s \u201csharply partisan response.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton ate the Republicans\u2019 supper Tuesday night, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Bob Dole wound up with heartburn,\u201d wrote Chicago Sun-Times syndicated columnist Carl Rowan two days later.\n\nAnd there was no doubt that House Republican Whip Tom DeLay (Texas) realized that politically, Clinton had won.

The voters who backed him in 2016, perhaps unsurprisingly, are more uniformly loyal than the pool of Americans who identify either as Republicans or as Republican-leaning independents. But, in any case, it\u2019s clear that Trump has consolidated the party broadly, if not universally, behind him.\n\nA 61 percent majority of Trump voters consider it a bad thing for Republican members of Congress to openly criticize the president when they disagree with him. Just 9 percent say it\u2019s a good thing for the party, with the other 30 percent neutral or unsure. That sentiment also finds support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, albeit by a somewhat smaller margin \u2015 54 percent say it\u2019s a bad thing and 14 percent that it\u2019s a good thing.\n\nThe results show at most only modest movement since October 2017, when a HuffPost/YouGov poll found that found that 65 percent of Trump voters and 60 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners considered GOP criticism of Trump to be bad for the party.\n\nMany don\u2019t see any conflict in supporting both the president and his party. About 6 in 10 Trump voters, and an equal percentage of Republicans and Republican leaners, say they consider themselves supporters both of Trump and the GOP. (In a sign of how niche \u201cnever Trumpers\u201d remain in the GOP, the sample size of Republicans who say they\u2019re supporters of the party but not the president is too small to report on in more detail.)\n\nMost on the right also see relatively little distance between the party\u2019s factions in Washington at the moment. A 57 percent majority of Trump voters believe that most or all of the congressional GOP supports Trump. By contrast, at the peak of infighting between Congress and the White House in 2017, just 42 percent said the same.\n\nIf pushed to choose whom they\u2019d be more likely to support in a political discussion between Trump and congressional Republicans, Trump voters currently say by a 64-percentage-point margin that they\u2019d be more likely to back the president. Republicans and Republican leaners say the same by a 46-point margin.\n\nThe poll was taken at the beginning of the month, just after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) lambasted the president in an editorial, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cconduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d Trump responded with a tweet calling on Romney to \u201cbe happy for all Republicans\u201d and to be \u201ca TEAM player & WIN!\u201d\n\nSeventy-nine percent of Trump voters disagree with Romney\u2019s comment, and 89 percent agree with Trump\u2019s rebuttal. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 70 percent disagree with Romney and agree with Trump. Trump voters say, 86 percent to 8 percent, that they\u2019d prefer Trump over Romney as president; Republicans and Republican leaners say the same, 80 to 12 percent.\n\nThe episode is unlikely to have many negative political ramifications for Romney in Utah: According to Associated Press polling, nearly two-thirds of the state\u2019s voters want to see Romney stand up to the president.\n\nBut nationally the spat resulted, at least temporarily, in an odd political realignment.

Trump would declare a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border, use an obscure authority to take unspent money to start wall construction, and Republicans and Democrats could vote for spending bills without wall funding.\n\nThe wall construction would likely then be halted by a court, but Trump and Republicans would have their justification for reopening the government.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images The idea of Trump appropriating money to projects Congress has blocked is fundamentally contrary to the Constitution, but he\u2019d likely find a lot of Republicans who\u2019d reluctantly go along.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal authority to disregard Congress and spend money that Congress has very explicitly not appropriated is dubious at best.\n\nRepublicans point to reprogramming authority the president has in cases of a national emergency, in which Trump could spend money designated for military construction projects on other projects he deems more important. Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, explained how that would work to the GOP conference on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe statute aside, the idea of Trump appropriating money to projects Congress has blocked is fundamentally contrary to the Constitution. But if Trump went that route, he\u2019d likely find a lot of Republicans who\u2019d reluctantly go along.\n\nAnd some GOP lawmakers would cheer him on.\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Trump had a \u201clegal basis\u201d for declaring a national emergency. \u201cI have read the law. It would not be frivolous if he does it,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nTexas Rep. Randy Weber said he thought the border was a national emergency and that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supported the president building the wall through that sort of declaration.\n\n\u201cObviously, we don\u2019t want any executive to overreach,\u201d Weber said. \u201cBut if this is indeed truly a national emergency, and he has that power, then he\u2019s well within his power to do that.\u201d\n\nWeber was also unconcerned that Trump\u2019s remedy for this \u201cnational emergency\u201d would be a wall that would take years to build.\n\n\u201cBill Clinton said he wouldn\u2019t drill in ANWR,\u201d Weber said, referring to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. \u201cHe said even if he agreed to it, it would take 10 years for Americans to see any of that oil. When did he get out of office? So you gotta start somewhere.\u201d\n\nObviously, we don\u2019t want any executive to overreach. But if this is indeed truly a national emergency, and he has that power, then he\u2019s well within his power to do that. Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas)\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) also told HuffPost he supported the president using a national emergency declaration to build the wall \u2015 \u201cI remember the argument against a fence in Jerusalem,\u201d he said \u2015 but even the Republicans who expressed some uneasiness with the president going around Congress to build a wall left themselves plenty of room if Trump did declare a national emergency.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said he looked at that sort of maneuver as a \u201cvery last resort\u201d and had encouraged Republicans and the president to keep negotiating, but he also said it was \u201ca tool in his toolbox.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read two different statutes that seem to give him authority in this particular case to do that,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cMy concern is, where does it lead from there? I mean, is everything a national emergency? Is climate change a national emergency? My reluctance is more on what the slippery slope might be.\u201d\n\nBut Meadows again stressed that this was an option for Trump and said he wouldn\u2019t back legislation to restrict the president\u2019s ability to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress.\n\nRep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) \u2015 another prominent Republican in the Freedom Caucus \u2015 said he wasn\u2019t going to rush to judgment.\n\n\u201cI would prefer the legislative option,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut if he keeps on trying and trying and trying, and the other side is so intractable that they refuse to discuss it, what other option do you have?\u201d\n\nSenate GOP leaders also had wishy-washy statements about the maneuver.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said he thought a national emergency declaration was something Trump and the administration were reviewing. \u201cCan he? Probably,\u201d Thune said.\n\nThune\u2019s predecessor as whip, John Cornyn (R-Texas), said the declaration shouldn\u2019t be necessary \u201ceven if it is theoretically available to him.\u201d He added that it would likely cause a lawsuit, \u201cso that means rather than solving the problem in days, you\u2019re looking at months or years until the issue is resolved.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans aren\u2019t exactly standing in the way of Trump declaring a national emergency to subvert Congress, even after Republicans were livid that Obama said he had a \u201cpen and a phone\u201d to ram through his legislative agenda.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said he\u2019d prefer Trump build the wall through a congressional appropriation so that he didn\u2019t have to pull money from other military construction projects, \u201cbut it is a crisis that we do need to address.\u201d\n\nMark Walker (R-N.C.) said he thought a national emergency declaration would get into \u201csome gray area,\u201d and said he would be \u201cuneasy\u201d with Trump building a wall that way, but he said he couldn\u2019t \u201cgo out affirmatively and say he can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nAnd even libertarian-minded Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) wouldn\u2019t speak against Trump using a national emergency declaration to get around Congress.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t considered the proposal seriously,\u201d Massie said.\n\nIf it\u2019s an emergency, everyone will know it, and everyone doesn\u2019t know it, so it\u2019s not an emergency. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.)\n\nSome Republicans entirely dodged the question. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) said pieces about him in HuffPost \u201chave not been the best, so I\u2019m gonna give you no comment.\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) referred us to a statement about Trump\u2019s address Tuesday night that did not answer questions about a national emergency declaration. And Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said he wasn\u2019t \u201cready for hypotheticals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he does it, ask me,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nOf the lonely GOP voices opposing such a move, there weren\u2019t many real repercussions offered if Trump went ahead with an emergency declaration. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that was not his preferred route, and he questioned whether Trump could legally do that, but he didn\u2019t offer any recourse if he did.\n\nSurprisingly, Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) said he didn\u2019t support the president using a declaration to build the wall. \u201cI think we need to go through Congress,\u201d Williams said, agreeing that doing otherwise would amount to executive overreach.\n\nAnd unsurprisingly, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was the most vocal. \u201cI\u2019m totally against that,\u201d Amash said.\n\nAmash said he would even support legislation restricting the president\u2019s ability to declare an emergency for purposes of building a wall, and suggested the situation at the border was not as dire as Trump or other Republicans made it out to be.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an emergency, everyone will know it, and everyone doesn\u2019t know it, so it\u2019s not an emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what he thought about Republicans criticizing Obama for executive overreach and now standing by Trump as he toys with this idea, Amash was plain-spoken. \u201cI think it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d he said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rep-steve-king-racist-white-supremacist-history_us_5c3d5eede4b0e0baf5407ba6": "After questioning how the terms \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d had \u201cbecome offensive\u201d in a recent interview with The New York Times, Republican congressman Steve King of Iowa was harshly rebuked by GOP leaders and stripped of all his committee assignments in the current Congress.\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate this in the Republican Party,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) declared Monday, referring to King\u2019s racist views.\n\nMcCarthy failed to mention, however, the many years of tolerance that the GOP \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 has shown to King\u2019s lengthy history of bigotry.

It\u2019s always been a promise that didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an applause line. And yet it is driving national policy at this point.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump did not offhandedly joke about forcing Mexico to pay for a massive, 30-foot-tall, reinforced concrete wall. He promised that he would force Mexico to pay for it \u2014 literally hundreds of times in his rallies, and even in interviews when he was asked whether he was serious.\n\nIn a March 2016 memo, Trump claimed he would force Mexico to make \u201ca one-time payment of $5-$10 billion\u201d or face garnishment of remittances from Mexican immigrants to their families in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThat fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cBut even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt.\u201d\n\nUpon taking office, Trump did not once broach the idea of Mexico paying in his conversations with that country\u2019s leaders, according to the Mexican government. In fact, in his first conversation with Mexico\u2019s then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto days after taking office, Trump acknowledged that Mexico would never pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly to avoid hurting Trump\u2019s standing with his supporters.\n\nAfter that phone call, more than a year passed before Trump started demanding a wall, only this time from U.S. taxpayers and Congress, which led to his claims starting in October that he had the power simply to ignore Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen the rules don\u2019t suit him, he breaks the rules, and then it gets tied up in courts,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cThis has been the pattern of his life.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the exclusive role given to Congress in the Constitution to decide whether and how much to spend for any given priority, Chen said.\n\nThat fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn\u2019t want to do. But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt. Douglas Rivlin, spokesman, America\u2019s Voice\n\nAll but a handful of the previous five dozen emergency declarations over the past four decades have imposed trade restrictions or other economic sanctions against nations for their aggressive behavior and human rights abuses.\n\nA May 22, 1997, declaration by Bill Clinton prohibited new investment in Burma. An April 3, 2014, declaration by Barack Obama imposed sanctions on leaders of South Sudan. The very first emergency \u2014 which is in place to this day \u2014 was declared by Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on Iran after the 1979 revolution.\n\nOnly a handful of the declarations have dealt with national policy outside of targeted sanctions. One, declared by Ronald Reagan in 1983, reinstated a ban on the export of technologies that could be used for military purposes. Congress had allowed the ban to lapse but did not oppose his use of the Emergencies Act to put it back into force.\n\nAnother came in 2005, when George W. Bush, without technically declaring an emergency, decreed the suspension of a requirement to pay workers involved in the Hurricane Katrina recovery a certain minimum wage. Democrats and some Republicans did object to that one, and set a vote in the House to disapprove it. Bush rescinded his decree the day before the scheduled vote.\n\nNot one of the previous emergencies, however, did anything close to what Trump is trying to do: pay for a project not only without Congress\u2019 approval, but after Congress has specifically rejected his request several times.\n\n\u201cThe law was intended to authorize a president to take action in a crisis that was unfolding too quickly for Congress to respond,\u201d Chen said. \u201cCongress has, in fact, made a decision. Congress has chosen not to give him the funds that he would like.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear if or when Trump would actually declare an emergency. Republican senators have already expressed their fears that enough of them would side with Democrats on the issue that a law rescinding the emergency would clear Congress, forcing Trump to back down or veto it \u2014 a choice that would likely lead to an attempt to override the veto. White House officials would say only that Trump is considering all his options and that he would do everything necessary to deal with the \u201ccrisis\u201d at the border.\n\nChen, though, said that Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 threatening an emergency, but only if Congress refused to give him what he wanted \u2014 have undermined the legal basis for one.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/payday-lenders-sure-have-a-cozy-relationship-with-the-trump-administration_n_5c65d5e3e4b0233af9732deb": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see the potential influence that predatory lenders may have,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nA company that defrauded customers but only got a slap on the wrist from the Trump administration also made a large donation to the president\u2019s 2017 inaugural committee.\n\nLast month, Enova International, an online payday lender that operates the brands NetCredit and CashNetUSA, agreed to pay a $3 million fine for illegally taking money from customers\u2019 bank accounts and failing to honor loan extensions. But the settlement included no refunds for the victims.\n\nPayday lenders as an industry donated more than $1 million to the inauguration, according to the liberal group Allied Progress, as well as tens of thousands to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. The Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group for the industry, last year started holding its annual conferences at a Trump hotel in Florida.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced it would rescind parts of a new federal regulation that had been designed to rein in abusive lending practices that lead people to take out loan after loan and sink into debt.\n\nFavorable treatment for payday lenders is consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s pro-business ideology, however, and there\u2019s no indication that donations have directly led to favorable treatment. But the donations are not a coincidence, either.\n\nConsumer advocates have complained that under Trump, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2015 which was created during the Obama years in large part to go after payday lenders\u2015 has drastically scaled back its regulatory mission and been softer on bad actors.\n\nThe regulation that the CFPB said it would rescind last week would have required small-dollar lenders like CashNetUSA to make sure their customers can pay them back \u2015 which would fundamentally disrupt the business model.\n\n\u201cWith a couple of exceptions nearly every enforcement settlement that we see makes you scratch your head and say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they pay more, why didn\u2019t consumers get anything?\u2019\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nAs for the campaign contributions, Saunders said, \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see the potential influence that predatory lenders may have.\u201d\n\nThe bureau said Enova earned \u201cmillions\u201d by illegally debiting customers\u2019 accounts without authorization, in some cases sticking customers with bank fees. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the CFPB said the bureau doesn\u2019t monitor political donations and that the people making decisions on the Enova case had no knowledge of the company\u2019s donation before HuffPost asked about it.\n\nThe regulation that the CFPB said it would rescind last week would have required small-dollar lenders like CashNetUSA to make sure their customers can pay them back \u2015 which would fundamentally disrupt the business model.\n\nPayday lenders typically require borrowers to allow debits from their bank accounts or sign a postdated check, and their customers are often so strapped for cash that the first loan rolls over into a series of additional, costlier loans, according to CFPB research. While the product can be helpful for someone without access to regular credit, with hefty fees the loans essentially bear triple-digit interest rates that are outright illegal in a number of states.\n\nIn its financial disclosures, Enova said demand for its product is fueled in part by \u201cstagnant to declining growth in the household income for working-class individuals.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Trump appointed his budget director, Mike Mulvaney, to also be the acting director of the consumer bureau, despite (or because of) the fact that Mulvaney opposed its creation in the first place. The former Republican congressman intervened in one investigation of a payday lender last year to drop charges that would have resulted in $8 million worth of restitution to the company\u2019s customers, Reuters reported in June. The company, South Carolina-based Security Group Inc., was found to have harassed customers at their homes and jobs in an effort to collect debts. It agreed to pay a $5 million fine.\n\nAs a former congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney ranked among the top recipients of campaign contributions from the payday lending industry. He has said that when he served in the House, he was more likely to listen to lobbyists if they contributed to his campaign. He proposed eliminating the consumer bureau and called it a sick joke. Mulvaney has since left the bureau to become Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff.\n\nAs a recently as 2006, the payday industry\u2019s political spending favored Democrats, but has since tilted heavily toward Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-science-committee-return-of-science_n_5c647d1fe4b0084c78e27f7c": "Tom Williams via Getty Images Rep.

The committee\u2019s Republican minority invited Joseph Majkut, an atmospheric scientist and director of climate policy at the libertarian-leaning Niskanen Center, as its witness.\n\n\u201cClimate change is real and global emissions of greenhouse gases are driving latter day global warming,\u201d Majkut said \u201cAs climate change continues, more severe and perverse effects will manifest themselves, causing economic harms and damages to individuals, ecosystems and other things that we tend to be concerned about.\u201d\n\nThe discussion largely focused on a pair of sobering recent climate assessments. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, published a report warning world governments that they must cut global emissions in half over the next 12 years to avoid catastrophic warming that would bring $54 trillion in damages. The following month, the federal government\u2019s National Climate Assessment concluded that without drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, warming in the United States \u201ccould increase by 9\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) or more by the end of this century.\u201d\n\nThe Earth \u201cis running a fever\u201d that is already driving heat waves, extreme rainfall events and coastal flooding, Dr. Robert Kopp, director of Rutgers University\u2019s Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and a lead author of the National Climate Assessment, told the panel.\n\n\u201cTo stabilize the global climate, net global carbon dioxide emissions must be brought to zero,\u201d Kopp said. \u201cThe faster we reduce our emissions, the less severe the effects and the lower the risk of unwelcome surprises.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, more than a dozen major climate- and weather-related disasters in the U.S. caused a record $306.2 billion in damages and killed more than 300 people. Last year\u2019s hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters caused an additional $91 billion in damages, according to an annual federal analysis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 5, 2017 file photo, smoke rises behind a destroyed apartment complex as a the Thomas wildfire burns in Ventura, Calif.\n\nRep. Bill Foster (D-Ill. ) thanked the Republican minority for inviting Majkut, someone whose views align with mainstream science. For years, the committee found itself \u201cwasting time arguing with non-technical witnesses\u201d about, for example, whether it would be a positive thing if the Greenland ice sheet were to melt, Foster said.\n\n\u201cThe climate challenges facing humanity are large,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, serious debate about the best path forward has often been stifled by the politicization of this issue, at least in this committee.\u201d\n\nThe event was not without Republicans trying to downplay and dismiss the all-but-irrefutable body of scientific research that shows human carbon emissions are driving climate change. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who famously claimed that falling rocks were responsible for rising sea levels, pointed to previous warming periods in Earth\u2019s history in an attempt to prove that humans are not to blame for today\u2019s rising seas.\n\nRepublicans also used the hearing to further their attack on Democrats\u2019 push for a so-called Green New Deal. The non-binding climate resolution, introduced last week by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), outlines lofty goals of slashing global greenhouse gas emissions 40 to 60 percent by 2030, building climate-resilient infrastructure and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t succeed with pie-in-the-sky policies that demand 100 renewable energy at the expense of reliable power from nuclear and fossil fuels, and raise energy prices for businesses and consumers,\u201d Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) said. Instead, he argued the solution lies in innovations in technologies like carbon capture and advanced nuclear energy.\n\nBut the scientific community has stressed that the world is rapidly running out of time to stave off potentially irreversible global warming.

The resolution calls for universal health care, a guarantee of high-wage jobs to American workers displaced by the rapid transition away from fossil fuels, and explicit protections for marginalized communities and indigenous tribes.\n\nBy sanctioning a vote, McConnell appears to be betting that the resolution will prove too radical for a good number of Democrats, let alone any Republicans.\n\nWhile a number of Senate Democrats have endorsed the Green New Deal, including some who have declared presidential bids for 2020, others have exercised more caution when asked if they will support the measure.\n\n\u201cThere will be all kinds of bills sponsored by individual presidential candidates...

A narrow majority of voters support raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal, according to a survey released last month by the think tank Data for Progress.\n\nRepublicans largely remained silent on the Green New Deal late last year when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a cadre of left-leaning Democrats began demanding a select committee in the House devoted to the proposal. Last week, a day before the resolution\u2019s release, Republicans in two House committees slammed the idea of a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to reducing emissions, calling the Green New Deal too \u201cradical\u201d for the United States.\n\nWhen the resolution came out on Thursday, roughly 65 House Democrats co-sponsored it, while fewer than a dozen senators did the same.\n\nBut the numbers are growing. On Monday, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), a moderate Democrat from Long Island with a seat on the powerful House Committee on Ways and Means, said he would support the resolution.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) defended her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday despite his vote in favor of an anti-abortion law in Louisiana last week.\n\nKavanaugh joined three other conservative justices in dissenting to a Supreme Court order that blocked an anti-abortion Louisiana law from going into effect; the law required doctors performing abortions to have the authority to admit patients to nearby hospitals.\n\nOpponents of that requirement say that it would have dramaticaly reduced eligible doctors, leaving the state just one physician to perform abortions. The law is virtually identical to a Texas anti-abortion law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 with the help of former Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was succeeded by Kavanaugh last year.\n\nProgressive advocacy groups are furious that Collins, who says she supports abortion rights, voted in favor of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. They say his decision to greenlight a law that would limit access to abortion only confirms their fears that he presents a long-term threat to Roe v. Wade, the major abortion rights precedent. Over the weekend, advocacy group Demand Justice aired digital ads in Maine slamming Collins for her Kavanaugh support.\n\nCollins insisted on Tuesday that Kavanaugh won\u2019t overturn Roe despite his anti-abortion vote last week, however. The senator argued that the justice took a \u201clogical approach\u201d in his dissent to the case and said she did not believe he contradicted precedents established by Roe and Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, which held that states can\u2019t place undue burdens on women seeking an abortion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how this is being viewed as somehow overturning Roe v. Wade except by people on the far left who are looking for anything,\u201d Collins told HuffPost on Tuesday.\n\nIn his dissent to the order, which he wrote separately from the other conservatives on the court, Kavanaugh argued the issue hinged on whether the doctors who perform abortions at the state\u2019s clinics can obtain admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they provide abortion care. Abortion providers in the state said that the Louisiana law would severely curtail access to abortions because of the requirement to the point where many clinics would be forced to close forever. Kavanaugh, however, argued that the state had sufficient time to resolve the matter of admitting privileges before the law took effect. If the doctors cannot obtain admitting privileges, he added, they can return to court.\n\n\u201cWhat he is simply saying is that if during that period of time the physicians do not get their privileges, they can come back to the court without prejudice. I think that was a logical approach, and he committed to following the precedent that was established in Whole Woman\u2019s Health,\u201d Collins added.\n\nShe has proven time and time again that she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not the millions of women who are asking her to give us the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut pro-choice advocates aren\u2019t letting Collins off the hook for her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Collins\u2019 defense of his vote \u201cabsurd.\u201d She said that requiring doctors to hold admitting privileges in local hospitals was already ruled as an undue burden by the Supreme Court in the Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision.\n\n\u201cShe has proven time and time again that she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not the millions of women who are asking her to give us the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Hogue told HuffPost on Tuesday, adding that Collins\u2019 continued support of Kavanaugh goes \u201cagainst all logic based on what we\u2019re seeing\u201d about the justice\u2019s rulings on the court.\n\nWhile Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four more liberal justices in blocking the Louisiana law from going into effect, it\u2019s probably not the final say the court will get on the matter. According to SCOTUSblog, the petitioners in the case are likely to seek further review, leading to possible oral arguments in the fall of 2019 or winter of 2020, with a decision that could come by the end of June 2020 \u2015 smack dab in the middle of the presidential campaign.\n\nCollins also faces a heated re-election fight in 2020. While her standing with Republican voters in Maine improved in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, she\u2019s likely to face a strong challenge in the general election.\n\nGOP senators who supported Kavanaugh will have to answer for their vote in coming months, Hogue said on Tuesday, adding that voters view threats to abortion as \u201cincreasingly real and material.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-statement-parkland_n_5c657c08e4b0aec93d3c3bee": "President Donald Trump noted the anniversary of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting Thursday with a statement that claimed his administration has made \u201ctremendous strides\u201d toward better school safety but barely mentioned gun control.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement recalled an emotional \u201clistening session\u201d held at the White House in the days after the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting, in which a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\n\u201cWe learned a lot that afternoon,\u201d the statement said. The president heard from the school shooting survivors and parents who were invited to share their thoughts about gun control as the president held a note card reminding himself to listen.\n\n\u201cWe took immediate action, committing ourselves to a sacred vow to do everything in our power to ensure that evil does not stalk our children on the playgrounds or in the hallways of our Nation\u2019s schools,\u201d Trump continued in Thursday\u2019s statement.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Parkland, Trump had initially expressed support for the type of strict gun legislation the National Rifle Association has long opposed, but abandoned those promises just a couple weeks later. He has since expressed support for more guns in schools \u2015 including an effort to arm some teachers \u2015 earning criticism from a vocal sector of Parkland students who were moved to fight against the powerful gun lobby.\n\nThe critics, including David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez, said they were not invited to the White House listening session. They went on to lead a nationwide gun control protest, March for Our Lives, in late March of last year.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s statement, the president touted his support for the STOP\n\nSchool Violence Act, a bipartisan measure to finance school safety training and security equipment, along with a measure to strengthen the national criminal background check system. Neither is a gun control measure. The Trump administration did tighten gun control in late 2018 by enacting a ban on bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to mimic machine guns, but that effort was not a response to Parkland.\n\nA December report issued by the Federal Commission on School Safety, convened by the Trump administration, downplayed the role of guns in school violence, instead focusing on rolling back certain Obama-era policies. The report also recommended arming some teachers and improving mental health care in schools.\n\nGun legislation has largely stalled at the federal level due to Republican opposition. Yet some progress has been made at the state level.

The congressman believes that while barriers are useful in urban areas, walls are useless in remote areas where it takes border patrol agents hours or even days to respond to a breach.\n\nThe congressman has spoken out previously against the wall, but he now has a new role on the House Appropriations Committee where he can wield some significant extra clout, and was eager to detail all the problems he has with the wall in this interview.\n\nAll nine representatives who represent border areas in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California oppose the wall, but Hurd is the only Republican.

Hurd estimates that 1,000 property owners in his district alone would be affected.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a thing in Texas we care about called private property rights,\u201d Hurd said.\n\nHe also noted that more than a million acres might be ceded to Mexico to build a wall, depending on physical barriers and which side of the Rio Grande the wall would be constructed.\n\nHurd believes border surveillance using radar and cameras, and a careful examination of what\u2019s being done and what works is a far more rational approach to take.\n\n\u201cThis is not rocket science,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cWe can solve this problem.

Lending money directly could run afoul of federal ethics law, but donating to charities that are helping furloughed employees would likely be legal.\n\nThe United States Secret Service also did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s queries about what guidance it is giving its agents who cannot meet their financial obligations because of the shutdown.\n\nThese are the people who are closest to him and clearly put their lives on the line for him every single day. He has demonstrated no empathy for them over this situation. Rick Tyler, Republican political consultant\n\nTrump has said almost nothing about the 800,000 federal employees who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay since their agencies\u2019 funding ran out at midnight Dec. 21. His few comments on the topic have been split between claiming \u2015 without evidence \u2014 that most of the employees are Democrats, or claiming \u2014 also without evidence \u2013 that they support his position and do not mind missing paychecks.\n\n\u201cMany of those people that won\u2019t be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Trump asserted earlier this week.\n\nTrump did say Friday that he would sign legislation requiring federal employees to receive back pay following a shutdown. Appropriating back pay has been common practice after previous shutdowns, but was not mandated by law.\n\nThe new bill passed both the Senate and House with overwhelming votes. While it guarantees that workers will eventually receive all their scheduled pay, it does nothing to help them in the short term while the shutdown is continuing.\n\nTrump has refused to sign any legislation that does not include $5.7 billion in money for his wall along the southern U.S. border, reneging on a previous commitment to sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts made fun of him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.\n\nTrump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump hasn\u2019t asked Mexico for payment even a single time. Indeed, in his first conversation as president with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mexico\u2019s president at the time, Trump said he understood Mexico would never pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly so as not to upset Trump\u2019s base of supporters.\n\nInstead of trying to force Mexico to pay for the wall, Trump began threatening early last year to shut down the U.S. government unless Congress gave him billions of dollars for it \u2014 even though the exact structure he wants remains unclear.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall made of reinforced concrete that extended so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. More recently, he has started saying the wall could just be steel slats \u2014 which would be the \u201cbollard fencing\u201d that was developed during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nIn fact, Trump posted a photo of a bollard fence on Twitter Friday, claiming it was a \u201cnew\u201d wall that he had constructed. In reality, it is a replacement barrier installed under a years-old program to upgrade and enhance the border barrier. There are 654 miles of barrier currently in place along the 2,000-mile Mexican border \u2014 the same amount that was in place the day Trump took office.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-homophobic-remarks_us_5c3a6030e4b01c93e00a5952": "It\u2019s been one day since Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) announced she was running for president in the 2020 election, and parts of her conservative past are already coming back to haunt her.\n\nThey returned in the form of homophobic remarks the congresswoman made over a decade ago. At least twice the Hawaii Democrat publicly called the LGBTQ community and supporters of same-sex marriage \u201chomosexual extremists.\u201d\n\nIn one instance in February 2004, Gabbard, at the time a 22-year-old state representative, was testifying against a bill aimed at legalizing same-sex civil unions.\n\n\u201cTo try to act as if there is a difference between \u2018civil unions\u2019 and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\u201d\n\nSix months later, Gabbard spoke more candidly while replying to an email originally sent to her father, Mike Gabbard, who was a Republican city councilman in Honolulu running for Congress.\n\n\u201cI smell a skunk,\u201d Gabbard told Honolulu Magazine. She was responding to an email that was originally addressed to her father asking about his ties to the leader of a Hare Krishna movement in Hawaii, according to the magazine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that you\u2019re acting as a conduit for The Honolulu Weekly and other homosexual extremist supporters of Ed Case [Mike Gabbard\u2019s opponent],\u201d she wrote.\n\nUm, yes. This is language she used frequently then https://t.co/FbIG7wP4OV \u2014 Nick Grube (@nickgrube) January 12, 2019\n\nIn a statement provided to HuffPost on Sunday night, Gabbard said she regretted her previous conduct, but noted her recent support for legislation backing LGBTQ rights over her years in Congress.\n\n\u201cFirst, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cMuch work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected President, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all,\u201d she said.\n\nGabbard was elected to the U.S. House in 2012 and became the first Hindu member of Congress, as well as one of Congress\u2019 first female combat veterans. She quickly became a star of the Democratic Party with her own rogue brand of progressive leadership.\n\nGabbard\u2019s remarks from 14 years ago were bound to resurface as she walked even further into the national spotlight with her presidential bid.\n\nAnd while Gabbard, 37, has evolved since then \u2015 she once backed a bill targeting discrimination based on sexual orientation and famously endorsed Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential bid at the expense of her post as Democratic National Committee vice chair \u2015 some people, including journalists from Hawaii to D.C., wouldn\u2019t let her off easy for her homophobic remarks.\n\nTulsi Gabbard referred to gay people as \u201chomosexual extremists\u201d and sided with Assad over Obama (to name a few concerns).\n\n\n\nNext.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/IbRw4Kt5JE \u2014 Peter Fox (@thatpeterfox) January 12, 2019\n\nSo, she\u2019ll co-sponsor bills supporting LGBTQ rights, but still personally thinks we\u2019re icky. https://t.co/vw5pl67lYs \u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 12, 2019\n\nTulsi Gabbard is a flat no.

Pritzker, a billionaire former businessman who will govern the 12.8 million people of Illinois, easily defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2018.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) reached a new level this week when The Daily Caller published fake revenge porn of the new congresswoman.\n\nSince Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old working-class democratic socialist, unexpectedly toppled powerful white male incumbent Joe Crowley in a June primary, she\u2019s become an object of fixation among Republicans, especially Republican men. Conservative writer Ed Scarry posted a photo of her backside on Twitter, questioning whether her black suit was befitting of a \u201cgirl who struggles.\u201d Right-wing media discovered that she \u2015 like a lot of people named \u201cAlexander,\u201d \u201cAlexandra\u201d or some variant thereof \u2015 went by the nickname \u201cSandy\u201d in high school. A self-proclaimed \u201cproud Christian Dad\u201d on Twitter circulated a video of her dancing in a T-shirt in college as if it would be a career-damaging revelation. A Republican strategist referred to her as \u201cthe little girl\u201d on Fox News, which runs segments about her constantly.\n\nHere is America's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is...\n\n...High School video of \"Sandy\" Ocasio-Cortez @AoDespair pic.twitter.com/j3hTnwErib \u2014 AnonymousQ1776 (@AnonymousQ17763) January 4, 2019\n\nThe obvious explanation is that men have literally never seen a woman in her 20s in the halls of Congress before. She\u2019s attractive, telegenic and good at social media. She dances outside her Cannon House office. Conservative men are confused at being drawn to this bright rising star in the Democratic Party while loathing everything she stands for.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t fully explain the fervor with which conservatives hang on her every word, waiting for her to slip, and dig through her past for any feeble sign that she isn\u2019t who she says she is. There\u2019s an existential, panicked tinge to the behavior here \u2015 what you might call \u201cAOC Derangement Syndrome.\u201d Indeed, some experts say conservative men are obsessed with Ocasio-Cortez because they\u2019re threatened by her.\n\nConservatives tend to respond to fear more strongly than liberals do, according to Bobby Azarian, a neuroscientist whose expertise in anxiety has led him to examine political behaviors. His research has found that the brains of conservative people are likely to display the same attention biases as the brains of people with anxiety.\n\n\u201cThe one main cognitive difference is that conservatives are more sensitive to threat,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fears are sometimes exaggerated. I think they fear her.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s power is a direct threat to conservatives because her very existence in Congress as a young, Latina, working-class woman threatens to upend the social order that has kept white men in the ruling class for centuries. (Eighty-eight percent of House Republicans are white men, most are over the age of 50, and the party\u2019s voters are majority white and male.) On top of that, she is using her position and platform to directly challenge that order \u2015 to attempt to get money out of politics, raise taxes on the super-rich and level the playing field.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t just challenge the patriarchy, she\u2019s challenging the race, class, and gender hierarchies all at once, as well as the capitalist system that requires member of Congress be wealthy before they get there,\u201d said Caroline Heldman, a gender and politics professor at Occidental College. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkably threatening.\u201d\n\nIn a way, Ocasio-Cortez is the most formidable opponent to President Donald Trump the Democratic Party has put forth yet. She has even more of a knack for social media than America\u2019s first Twitter president; she\u2019s anti-establishment like he is; she breaks all the rules of how a politician is supposed to behave; and she has an undeniably strong emotional appeal.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s engaging attention and emotion in people at this visceral level,\u201d Azarian said. \u201cShe has some combination of a lot of features that really seems to give her this ability to go viral. And I think that\u2019s what Trump had.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why conservatives want and need to undercut her influence. And the most time-tested way to undermine a woman\u2019s power is to sexualize her, to make her an object instead of an agent. A 2013 study by the Women\u2019s Media Center found that merely discussing a female candidate\u2019s appearance has a negative effect on her support from voters.\n\n\u201cThe moment at which you turn someone into a sex object, you put yourself in a position of authority over them, which is why sexual harassment is classified as being a form of gender discrimination in the workplace,\u201d Heldman said. \u201cThey are the object who exists for you, and you are validating their worth.\u201d\n\nOr, as former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Jess McIntosh put it: \u201cDefining a woman\u2019s value by whether or not men want to have sex with her is the oldest trick in the patriarchy. Either way, she\u2019s diminished.\u201d\n\nThe problem for these men is that Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t seem interested in what they think of her. She doesn\u2019t seek attention for anything other than her policy ideas and ambition, even though Americans still seem to dislike power-seeking women. The typical strategies men use to devalue women \u2015 \u201csexualizing, dismissing, controlling, teasing, criticizing, interrupting, psychopathologizing, humiliating, abusing,\u201d according to one psychologist \u2015 seem to bounce right off her.\n\n\u201cAlexandria presents a challenge, because conservative men or men in general who are encouraged to objectify women are attracted to her, but she\u2019s also \u2018unmanageable\u2019 in that she doesn\u2019t exist for them,\u201d Heldman said. \u201cShe is a woman who not only has now formal power, but a lot of informal power, in that she doesn\u2019t give a damn what they think of her. I think it\u2019s a disconcerting place for men who may be used to attractive women seeking their validation.\u201d\n\nThat kind of inability to deal with a woman like Ocasio-Cortez is, in many ways, emblematic of the broader crisis facing the Republican Party, which is moving backward in terms of gender diversity in Congress even as Democrats add more women and people of color to their ranks each year. In the 1990s, women were equally distributed across both parties in Congress; today, there are 13 Republican women and 89 Democratic women. Republicans have only ever had one black woman in the House of Representatives, Mia Love of Utah, and she just lost her bid for re-election.\n\nThat\u2019s a self-reinforcing dynamic, said Laurel Elder, politics professor and head of the gender studies program at Hartwick College.\n\n\u201cThe way they\u2019ve talked about some of the new women in the 116th Congress, and the way they\u2019ve tried to belittle or mock [Ocasio-Cortez], this just makes women feel like, \u2018Oh, this party is not welcoming of women,\u2019\u201d Elder said. \u201c\u2018This is not a place where I\u2019d feel comfortable throwing my hat in the ring.\u2019 Now the dynamic has a life of its own.\u201d\n\nThe obsessive focus on Ocasio-Cortez and her past may not just discourage Republican women from seeking office \u2015 it could intimidate any woman who grew up in the age of social media and is interested in politics but doesn\u2019t want to see her adolescent life splashed all over the front pages.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-democrats-republicans-too-extreme-centrist_us_5c62fb54e4b0b50014aa6171": "Just over a tenth of Americans think that both the Democratic and Republican parties are too extreme, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.\n\nOverall, Americans say, 50 percent to 33 percent, that President Donald Trump is too extreme.

Trump chose to put Jackson's portrait in the Oval Office and has said he is \"a fan.\"\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Over the weekend, the president of the United States appeared to make a punchline out of Native American genocide to score political points. You might have missed it because hardly any of the nation\u2019s top leaders called him out on it.\n\n\u201cToday Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWill she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the apparent offensiveness of the president\u2019s words. Trump\u2019s use of \u201cTRAIL\u201d in all-caps evokes the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of Native Americans from their homeland in the southeastern United States, which led to thousands of deaths from disease, starvation and exposure. His constant mockery of Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d meanwhile, demeans a historic Native woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Cherokee woman. I have ancestors who were on the trail. And I was \u2015 at this point, I shouldn\u2019t be shocked by anything that President Trump says or does \u2015 I was honestly shocked,\u201d said Candessa Tehee, an assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Northeastern State University. \u201cThat he\u2019s willing to so casually invoke the darkest chapter of American history to take a cheap shot at a rival, I was flabbergasted.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for clarification on what Trump was getting at with this remark.\n\nBut the paradox of Trump is that he is so casually racist against Native Americans, and yet, his slurs go largely unchallenged by both Democratic and Republican leaders \u2015 even as Native groups denounce him.\n\nThis time, some Republicans even tacitly endorsed Trump\u2019s mockery: Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who chairs the House GOP Conference, shrugged off his tweet when asked about it Sunday and tried to refocus on Warren. On the same day as the president\u2019s tweet, the Republican Party sent out a press release titled \u201cFauxcahontas\u2019 Failure To Launch.\u201d Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., piled on Trump\u2019s remark with his own slur.\n\n\u201cWe see our elected officials speaking out vehemently against racism regularly, yet very few have condemned Trump\u2019s racist rants against Natives,\u201d said Raina Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes under President Barack Obama and currently a consultant on tribal policy. \u201cI believe this silence is rooted in the continued invisibility of Native people and the lack of political will by politicians. Some don\u2019t think they have to speak out, so they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNone of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders appeared to directly condemn Trump\u2019s apparent Trail of Tears reference. None of the top four House and Senate Democratic and Republican leaders pushed back on it, either. The only one of those four who responded to a request for comment was Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said, \u201cIf he issues a comment on the President\u2019s tweet I will send it your way.\u201d\n\nWe see our elected officials speaking out vehemently against racism regularly, yet very few have condemned Trump\u2019s racist rants against Natives. Raine Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes under President Barack Obama\n\nOne House leader did speak up. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), chair of the Democratic Caucus, questioned when any Republicans will ever denounce Trump.\n\n\u201cTrail of tears massacre is part of Native American genocide perpetrated against millions of indigenous people,\u201d Jeffries tweeted Monday. \u201cMocking this shameful episode is a hateful trope.\u201d\n\nTrump chose the picture of Jackson for the Oval Office and has said that he is \u201ca fan\u201d of Jackson\u2019s populism.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Here's Trump standing with Native American veterans in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office. He attacked Elizabeth Warren as \"Pocahontas\" at this event.\n\nOn Friday, Trump made a reference to a conservative pundit going \u201coff the reservation,\u201d yet another phrase offensive to at least some Native people.\n\nElected leaders may be understandably reluctant to wade into Trump\u2019s criticisms of Warren, and it would be essentially impossible to respond to every offensive tweet the president fires off. But if they\u2019re not willing to tease apart the difference between Trump attacking Warren versus his slurs and mockery of Native people and culture, it means the president gets away with normalizing racist language in the name of a joke or a campaign attack.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it\u2019s not the Massachusetts senator bearing the brunt of those attacks. It\u2019s indigenous people, over and over again.\n\nPeople in positions of power have a responsibility to call out Trump every time he dehumanizes Native people, said Mary Kathryn Nagle, an attorney and Cherokee Nation citizen. She noted the contrast between the recent widespread condemnation of Virginia elected officials for wearing blackface and the relative silence in response to Trump\u2019s apparent mocking of the Trail of Tears.\n\n\u201cThe effect of that silence is incredibly traumatic, especially for our kids, because when they see that, OK, everyone is upset about blackface but no one is upset that apparently the genocide of my people is a joke? What does that mean about me and my worth as a human being?\u201d Nagle said.\n\nThe president\u2019s attacks on Native people have the equally distressing effect of erasing the stories of real people, she added. Trump is using indigenous people \u201cas characters, as almost cartoons in a political feud,\u201d she said, and that \u201cgives the American public the implicit permission to do that to the actual Native people living here.\u201d\n\nNagle\u2019s take echoes the findings of a groundbreaking, multi-year study conducted by Native researchers that surveyed how the American public views indigenous people. They found that the vast majority of Americans learn about Native people only through pop culture and media, where Native Americans are barely represented \u2014 and when they are, it is typically in the context of racist team mascots for sports teams or stereotypes. Just 13 percent of state history curriculum standards about indigenous people cover events past the year 1900, which means most Americans have no concept of contemporary Native American people.\n\nThe fact that Americans are taught a distorted version of history early on \u2015 one that glosses over the atrocities the U.S. committed against indigenous people \u2015 makes it easier for them not to feel guilty about the country\u2019s history of mass genocide and to keep Native people in the margins, said Dr. Arianne Eason, one of the project\u2019s researchers.\n\n\u201cUntil we start unpacking that, we can live in this space where omission feels OK. It assuages our guilt,\u201d Eason said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to feel bad about what\u2019s happening and contend with a group of people saying literally in our faces, \u2018We are still here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat he\u2019s willing to so casually invoke the darkest chapter of American history to take a cheap shot at a rival, I was flabbergasted. Candessa Tehee, assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Northeastern State University\n\nAdrienne Keene, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and assistant professor of American studies and ethnic studies at Brown University, tweeted that every time she hears \u201cPocahontas\u201d or \u201cLie-awatha\u201d or \u201cchief\u201d jokes, it\u2019s a reminder of how close to the surface and accessible these stereotypes are.\n\n\u201cThese \u2018jokes\u2019 show me that most Americans don\u2019t think of Native folks as your neighbors, your professors, your friends, or your fellow citizens,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump has given no indication that he\u2019s listening to Native communities or their concerns when he goes after Warren. To the contrary, he treats \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2015 a name he has called Warren at least 18 times on Twitter alone \u2015 as a clever insult.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has tried to defend Trump for invoking Pocahontas\u2019 name when attacking Warren by arguing that her name is not a racial slur.\n\nBut Pocahontas was a real Powhatan woman \u201cwhose life was cut short in a terrible way,\u201d as Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) has put it. \u201cWhen I think of that story \u2014 and the hundreds of sad and disturbing stories of how Native people have suffered throughout history, I can\u2019t imagine making a mockery of their names or their lives,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt may seem futile to try to stop Trump\u2019s racist comments about Native people or any other group. But the way people in positions of power respond to him when he does \u2015 or when they don\u2019t respond at all \u2015 arguably matters more.\n\nTrump may never get the message that Native Americans aren\u2019t a mascot or political joke, Nagle said, but hopefully, the next generation will learn \u201cthat what Trump is doing is wrong, and they shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liz-cheney-green-new-deal_us_5c63469ee4b03de942968b77": "Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, falsely claimed Tuesday that the Green New Deal seeks to \u201coutlaw\u201d airplanes, cars, gasoline and \u201cprobably the entire U.S. military.\u201d\n\nCheney\u2019s comments, which came during a congressional hearing on climate change, parroted a tweet that President Donald Trump posted last week. She said constituents in Wyoming are particularly concerned that the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution aimed as decarbonizing the U.S. economy to prevent catastrophic climate change, would mean no more air travel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be crucially important for us to recognize and understand when we outlaw plane travel, we outlaw gasoline, we outlaw cars \u2015 I think, actually, probably the entire U.S. military \u2015 because of the Green New Deal, that we are able to explain to our constituents and to people all across this country what that really means,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nCheney referred to a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d document that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) office circulated but, as The Washington Post reported, that version didn\u2019t accurately portray what was in the resolution. That FAQ, one of at least two versions that went out, called for building \u201chigh-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means that the government is going to be telling people where they can fly to and where they can\u2019t,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd I would assume \u2015 I guess that means our colleagues from California are going to be riding their bicycles back home to their constituents.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the Green New Deal says nothing about eliminating airplanes, cars or the military. Instead, the non-binding resolution \u2015 introduced last week by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) \u2015 outlines lofty goals of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, building climate-resilient infrastructure and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), one of nearly 80 co-sponsors of the resolution, said Cheney\u2019s line of questioning was \u201cbased on absolute hooey\u201d and that no supporter wants to ban air travel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cNone of us want to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere comes a point where this type of questioning is so disingenuous and so completely disconnected from anything factual that there ought to be a mechanism to strike it from the record,\u201d Huffman added. (Cheney walked out of the hearing during Huffman\u2019s response.)\n\nHuffman noted that the unofficial FAQ was later removed. In a post to Twitter over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti wrote that \u201can early draft of a FAQ that was clearly unfinished and that doesn\u2019t represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake.\u201d\n\nThere comes a point where this type of questioning is so disingenuous and so completely disconnected from anything factual that there ought to be a mechanism to strike it from the record. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.)\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped conservatives from using the document as fodder.\n\nHouse Republicans launched an assault on the Green New Deal during a pair of congressional hearings on climate last week, dismissing it as a \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d proposal. Like Cheney, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) took to misrepresenting the plan, stoking fears that it would mean shuttering military bases around the globe and cutting military spending by 50 percent \u2015 proposals floated by former Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein back in 2016, but not by any co-sponsor of the resolution.\n\nThe attacks have only continued. On the Senate floor Tuesday, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) dubbed the Green New Deal a \u201csocialist fairy tale.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) also called it \u201csocialist fairy tale\u201d and said Democrats are trying to \u201creplace six-figure energy jobs with bioenergetic hemp farms and wind-powered coffee shops.\u201d\n\nCheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, also took an opportunity Tuesday to go to bat for the fossil fuel industry \u2015 a top donor of her congressional campaigns. Residents of Wyoming \u2015 the largest coal-producing state in the country \u2015 are concerned about the impact a Green New Deal would have on local economy and the energy sector as a whole, she said.\n\n\u201cThe reliability is something that simply cannot be replaced,\u201d Cheney said of coal. \u201cIt\u2019s a national security issue, in addition to an economic issue.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-ilhan-omar_us_5c6380cce4b03de94296b6d5": "Vice President Mike Pence became the latest White House figure to criticize Rep.

He said that Omar should be \u201cashamed of herself\u201d and that her apology wasn\u2019t good enough. Asked what else she should do on the matter, he simply said Omar \u201cknows what to say.\u201d He later called on her to resign from Congress.\n\nOthers have said they accept her apology and would like to move on, including Rep.

She wants to see a great country, and I look forward to working with her.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has faced near-constant controversy for his xenophobia and racist attacks on many communities. He has regularly demeaned Mexicans and asylum seekers from Central America and has continued to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with anti-Native American rhetoric.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-federal-agency-staffing-impasse_us_5c632fa0e4b08da0ec7fb62a": "Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Jan. 9, before a meeting with President Donald Trump on the partial government shutdown. The stalemate over unfilled posts at federal agencies is just as serious.\n\nThere\u2019s an important battle brewing between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats, one with serious implications for the way the country is governed. No, I\u2019m not referring to the prospect of another government shutdown, though that is serious. I mean the actual staffing of the government, the top officials who run our federal agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s a contest with high stakes, particularly for Democrats, who control few levers of power in Washington, despite their new majority in the House of Representatives. And yet the tussle over regulatory nominations has flown under the radar in political media, obscured by more explosive confrontations.\n\nFor several months now, the Trump administration has kept Wall Street watchdog posts vacant by sitting on Democratic nominations. And for months progressive political organizations have been leaning on Senate Democrats to do something \u2015 anything \u2015 about it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is unprecedented,\u201d according to Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research. \u201cAnd the Democrats are allowing Republicans to do it without exerting either tactical leverage or rhetorical leverage by speaking out against it.\u201d\n\nMost federal agencies have a chairperson or top-level official who runs the show. The president gets to select that person, and while Democrats can cry foul over nominees they don\u2019t like, there isn\u2019t a whole lot they can do without Republican help to block a Trump candidate for these jobs.\n\nBut Democrats do have influence over a host of other positions that wield real power. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, is designed to be bipartisan \u2015 two of the five commissioners that run the agency can\u2019t come from the president\u2019s party. While the Republican majority will always have the final say, there\u2019s a lot that a Democratic commissioner can do \u2015 document corporate abuses, lean on enforcement staff and negotiate with Republicans over the regulatory agenda.\n\nConsider the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra published a pointed memo about the need to punish \u201crecidivist\u201d corporate offenders. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Facebook, which has been operating under a consent order from the FTC since 2011. Under the order, Facebook had agreed to reform the way it tracked user data and shared those data with other companies. If Facebook violated the terms of that order \u2015 and the company\u2019s mounting heap of scandals makes it seem increasingly likely that it did \u2015 then, Chopra suggested, the FTC should take strong punitive measures to demonstrate that large corporations are not above the law.\n\nChopra can\u2019t force the Republican-controlled FTC to actually do anything. But his memo made quite a splash. Where in the past, weak regulators might have hurried to absolve Facebook with a slap-on-the-wrist penalty, Republicans at the FTC now face the prospect of public humiliation if they carry water for the tech company during its ongoing meltdown.\n\nChopra is one of the few Democratic nominees to make it through the Trump administration logjam. Last summer, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recommended Trump fill open Democratic posts at the SEC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with longtime regulator Allison Lee and FDIC veteran Martin Gruenberg. In November, he recommended Graham Steele, a former staffer to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), for another FDIC post. Previous presidents quickly shepherded such recommendations to the Senate, but Trump has yet to formally nominate any of them. He has, however, found time to move ahead with installing a Republican replacement for outgoing Federal Housing Finance Chairman Mel Watt.\n\nIn December, Trump picked Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief economist Mark Calabria for the job. Calabria is a libertarian true-believer who advocates a return to the gold standard and has called to eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing giants he would regulate if confirmed as FHFA chairman. Calabria is scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\n\nLate last month, 20 progressive organizations signed a letter chastising Senate Democrats for inaction on Democratic appointees. By blocking or delaying Republican nominees, the groups wrote, Democrats could pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) into a deal in which the idle Democratic candidates are approved alongside Republicans \u2015 as was customary in previous administrations.\n\nSome of those progressive groups are now specifically calling for Democrats to block the Calabria nomination by placing a hold on it until other Democratic nominees are allowed to come to the floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible,\u201d said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, a net-roots group that focuses on contesting corporate power.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible. David Segal, Demand Progress\n\nIt\u2019s essentially a continuation of last year\u2019s fight between progressives and Schumer over the confirmation of federal judges. At the time, Schumer came under heavy fire for agreeing to confirm large batches of judges by unanimous consent, without securing any Democratic priorities in exchange \u2015 though Schumer (dubiously) argued that letting Democrats go home and campaign without missing votes would help them in the November election. But while Schumer took all of the heat last year, he was acting on behalf of his caucus. Senate Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, were happy to avoid a confrontation.\n\nPrivately, some Democratic staffers continue to insist they have no power. McConnell has final say over confirmation votes, they argue, and if he wants to bring up only Republican nominees, he can. Fighting, the thinking goes, will inevitably result in losing.\n\nBut one aide to a Democratic senator told HuffPost that Calabria\u2019s nomination will not be confirmed by unanimous consent, suggesting that someone \u2015 the aide did not specify who \u2015 will put a hold on the nomination.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats can\u2019t force McConnell or Trump to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. But they can create headaches for them, eating up valuable time on the Senate calendar by demanding that every GOP nomination proceed to a full floor vote. Approving candidates by unanimous consent is faster and leaves the Republican majority with more time to do what it wants to do. McConnell might very well prefer the calendar time to annoying floor fights and bad press from sabotaging the bipartisan nomination process.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/el-paso-trump-rally-carnival-of-lies_us_5c62ed0ae4b00ba63e4ae43b": "EL PASO, Texas \u2014 As thousands of Donald Trump supporters lined up outside the El Paso County Coliseum Monday afternoon, waiting to see the president hold his first official re-election campaign rally near the U.S.-Mexico border, the MAGA merchants were in a frenzy.\n\nSome vendors pulled carts full of red or camouflage \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, yelling, \u201cTen dollars, cash or credit!\u201d Others made elaborate displays of flags for sale.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the resolution\u2019s main sponsor, finally pushed his bill through on a 248-177 vote after Republicans repeatedly blocked it in the previous session. The measure invokes congressional authority over war and peace to require President Donald Trump to withdraw U.S. forces involved in fighting in Yemen, except those battling the local branch of al Qaeda.\n\nIt reiterates the message of a similar bill that passed the Senate late last year, and supporters hope the legislation will soon make it through the upper chamber again. Passage would force Trump to change course or justify a veto by explaining his ongoing support for a policy that has killed thousands of Yemenis and contributed to mass starvation there since the U.S. began helping the Saudi-led coalition in 2015.\n\n\u201cToday is historic,\u201d Khanna said in a statement after the vote. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the direction people are pushing our party to take on foreign policy, promoting restraint and human rights and with the sense they want Congress to play a much larger role.\u201d\n\nThe measure\u2019s success in the House shows how much progress congressional critics of the war and activist groups have made in challenging the flow of American bombs, fuel and intelligence to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others battling Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.\n\nRepublican leadership stymied them in the House for years, shielding Trump from having to make a decision and protecting a strategy they view as a check on Tehran. They have used legislative maneuvers in three separate instances to keep Khanna\u2019s bill off the House floor.\n\nSkeptics of the war focused instead on winning over senators, tying concerns over Yemen to anger over the Saudi state\u2019s role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With a Senate win under their belt, they pushed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to promise an early vote once the new Democratic House came into session \u2015 and on Wednesday, she made good.\n\nAll Democrats present in the chamber and 18 Republicans ultimately voted for the measure. More than 50 Democrats did, however, back a successful GOP-led amendment affirming the president\u2019s right to share intelligence with foreign countries on vaguely defined national security grounds \u2015 a signal that will reassure Riyadh and make the next Senate effort more complicated, as the body will now no longer be voting on the same language it considered back in December.\n\nPressure from Congress and growing global frustration with the Saudis have driven the warring parties to take negotiations more seriously. Even Trump felt compelled last year to rein in U.S. military support, officially ending the practice of refueling Saudi coalition planes midair to allow them to take longer bombing runs \u2015 though he still has the right to change his mind, barring congressional action. A United Nations-brokered cease-fire has held since December with only a few exceptions.\n\nBut conditions are worsening for the tens of millions of Yemenis now dependent on some form of aid, and there\u2019s been little progress on that front. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is continuing its saber-rattling on Iran while downplaying outrage over Khashoggi, and there\u2019s growing evidence that American weapons given to the Saudi coalition have ended up in more dangerous hands.\n\nMuch of the GOP continues to argue that Yemen should be viewed primarily as a venue for confronting Iran, which has supplied the insurgent Houthi militia there. The resolution could represent a \u201cgreen light\u201d to the Houthis to continue taking arms from the Iranians and committing abuses like recruiting child soldiers, said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nAnd in the Senate, the 53-member Republican majority is unlikely to welcome a companion bill to Khanna\u2019s House resolution. A more targeted bipartisan package of sanctions on the Saudis over Yemen and Khashoggi hasn\u2019t yet made it to the calendar of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That panel\u2019s chair, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), opposed last December\u2019s Yemen withdrawal bill.\n\nOpponents of supporting the Saudi-led coalition \u2015 who have formed an expanding network that includes several top conservative groups \u2015 say they\u2019re energized for the next fight.\n\n\u201cCongress realized #YemenCantWait,\u201d Kate Kizer of the advocacy group Win Without War wrote on Twitter. \u201cOnto the Senate!\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, an unprecedented 56 senators voted to end all support for this war, and that vote put much-needed pressure on Saudi Arabia,\u201d Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation wrote to HuffPost in an email. \u201cNow, 51 of those senators are still serving in the Senate, and this legislation only needs 51 votes for passage.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-aclu-lawsuit_n_5c6341a2e4b03de942968362": "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two New Hampshire college students seeking to block a controversial new requirement for voters in the state, saying it imposes an unconstitutional \u201cpoll tax\u201d on voters and makes it disproportionately harder for students to cast a ballot.\n\nIn order to vote in New Hampshire, one needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there \u2015 meaning they have a continued physical presence in the state that they intend to maintain. Being \u201cdomiciled\u201d is legally different from being a \u201cresident.\u201d The state legally defines a resident as someone who intends to remain in the state \u201cfor the indefinite future.\u201d\n\nThe new measure, HB 1264, which is set to take effect on July 1, removes the phrase \u201cfor the indefinite future\u201d from the definition of resident and makes it identical to the definition of domiciled. Thus, anyone claiming to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in order to be eligible to vote is also saying they are a resident and is then obligated to required to get a driver\u2019s license and register their car within 60 days.\n\nThe ACLU says the change is unconstitutional because it imposes a needless and unnecessary burden on college students and others who don\u2019t plan to stay in the state permanently but want to vote there. The civil liberties group says the measure violates the First and 14th amendments because the state hasn\u2019t \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d the law to advance a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nThey also say it violates the 24th Amendment, which prohibits poll taxes, as well as the 26th Amendment, which grants the right to vote to anyone 18 or older.\n\nJulie Ebenstein, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project, noted New Hampshire lawmakers had been trying for decades to impose similar restrictions on college students\u2019 ability to vote. In 1972, a three-judge panel said a law that barred people who planned to leave a New Hampshire town at some point in the future from voting was unconstitutional. In 2014, a state court struck down a law that explicitly required anyone who registered to vote in New Hampshire to get a state driver\u2019s license and to get their vehicle registered there. That decision was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans passed HB 1264 shortly after Democrat Maggie Hassan defeated Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes for one of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seats in 2016. In the same year, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump in the state. Ebenstein noted the bill passed along party lines in the legislature and that lawmakers appeared to be targeting young voters and college students based on a perception that they supported Democrats.\n\n\u201cCollege students are perceived by legislators as being more liberal or being more left and we know that because the legislators said so. ... Given legislators\u2019 perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe 2016 election was very close in New Hampshire.\u201d She added that because of the state\u2019s small population the 13,000 undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire can make a difference in a close election.\n\nGiven legislators' perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted. Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney, ACLU Voting Rights Project\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, are Caroline Casey and Maggie Flaherty, two sophomores at Dartmouth College who are registered to vote in New Hampshire despite growing up outside the state. Both voted in the 2018 midterm elections there. Neither woman has a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and both intend to leave the state after graduating from college. Neither has a car and said in the complaint filed Wednesday that traveling to the nearest Division of Motor Vehicles would be a burden to them.\n\nIn a July op-ed justifying the law, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) wrote that people can vote in New Hampshire without satisfying the obligations of residents. The new law, he said, would put everyone on \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\nIn an advisory opinion last year, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found 3-2 that the new measure did not violate either the New Hampshire Constitution or the First or 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the law did not amount to a poll tax nor did it target young voters.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the State may legitimately establish procedures by which persons who may be tempted to insincerely claim domicile for voting purposes are discouraged from doing so by the prospect that such a claim can result in their incurring the full panoply of obligations imposed on all other state residents,\u201d the majority wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that states may not condition the right to vote on the payment of a tax or fee,\u201d they continued. \u201cHowever, the opponents of HB 1264 are mistaken when they claim that the bill conditions voting on the payment of motor vehicle fees or taxes. Rather, if a person becomes obligated to pay such fees or taxes, it will not be because the person votes, but because the person owns or drives a motor vehicle and is a resident of this state. Thus, a person who claims domicile in New Hampshire for voting purposes but who does not drive or own a motor vehicle will have no obligation to pay motor vehicle related fees.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images The ACLU is suing New Hampshire over a change in the legal definition of \"resident.\" The change is set to go into effect later this year.\n\nBut Ebenstein said the two students in the case had already shown they were legitimate New Hampshire voters. The state, she said, was essentially adding an additional hurdle for the students to prove they were bona fide residents.\n\n\u201cOur clients, who moved to New Hampshire, been active on campus, been active in their communities, who have already participated in the political process in New Hampshire are fully committed to their state and their role in the local community and certainly do to New Hampshire play a large role in the political conversation and process. That\u2019s most likely why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with ensuring someone\u2019s eligibility. It\u2019s just once they are eligible, the state can\u2019t put barriers in the way of letting them exercise that right,\u201d she added. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to prove their devotion to New Hampshire by paying fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sununu expressed confidence the law would be upheld:\n\nThis lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate attempt to dredge up arguments that our State Supreme Court already rejected last summer. The Supreme Court addressed each of the legal arguments made by opponents of House Bill 1264 and found that the law ensures that every voter is treated the same. I fully expect our federal court to reach the same conclusion. Given that House Bill 1264 does nothing more than align New Hampshire with virtually every other state in requiring residency in order to vote, the plaintiffs in this suit should be asked whether they plan to file identical lawsuits in every other state.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Sununu.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-victory-spending-deal_n_5c64ac0de4b0aec93d3b012e": "Bloomberg via Getty Images If Democratic leaders can contain their defections to single digits, it will certainly seem like Democrats won this deal.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 As of Wednesday night, the spending deal to avoid another government shutdown still hadn\u2019t been finalized, but House Democrats were more than ready to pass the legislation and declare victory as soon as Thursday \u2015 even if the actual agreement is less of a win than they claim.\n\nLawmakers expect to release text late on Wednesday of a deal that would provide money until October for the same government agencies that were shut down in parts of December and January. Without the new deal, those agencies would close down again on Saturday, and for many lawmakers, avoiding another shutdown is reason enough to vote for the bill.\n\nBut Republican and Democratic leaders are also going around to their members and selling the agreement as a win for their side when the truth is a bit more drawish.\n\nNo, President Donald Trump does not get money for a concrete wall \u2015 or even as much money as Senate appropriators were discussing in the spring for physical barriers \u2015 but the deal does include $1.375 billion for \u201cbollard fencing.\u201d If you don\u2019t know what bollard fencing is, it sort of looks like a massive steel wall.\n\nDemocrats will be able to tout that the bill explicitly blocks Trump from using that fencing in certain areas, and that Trump can only use wall designs that are currently in use, and that Trump only gets 55 miles of new fencing. But Democrats are coming off of their position that $0 ought to go to a physical barrier.\n\nTrump will get to stand in front of the new fencing and point to it as his wall, and he\u2019ll still be able to declare a national emergency and try to raid other accounts for more wall money. There are no policy riders in the bill blocking Trump from that gambit, though such a move will almost certainly get tied up in the courts.\n\nRegardless of who\u2019s actually winning on the policy, Democrats are almost certainly winning on the politics.\n\nOne of the most complicated issues in the deal is the number of detention beds at the border. If you listen to Democrats, the deal will reduce the number of detention beds to 40,520, which is the number Congress previously agreed to. But, if you talk to Republicans, the legislation actually removes the cap and funds an average of 45,274 beds, according to Vox. A senior Democratic aide told HuffPost that there are currently 49,057 beds in use, so even though lawmakers are funding more than what they previously authorized, that\u2019s just to provide for a \u201cglide path\u201d to get to the mandated limit.\n\nThe truth is, we might not know exactly what these provisions do until we see the legislative text \u2015 and even then, the Trump administration could find a way to work around the law. Either way, they\u2019re still a far cry from the policies of those who want to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d or dramatically curb the United States\u2019 immigrant detention policies.\n\nThere\u2019s also a grab bag of other items that didn\u2019t go Democrats\u2019 way. The legislation won\u2019t include back pay for federal contractors who were shut out of their job for 35 days during the last shutdown. The bill won\u2019t restrain the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d sometimes referred to as the \u201cGlobal Gag Rule,\u201d which blocks funding for NGOs offering abortion services or counseling. And, in the words of one senior Republican aide, it maintains a number of other \u201cpro-life provisions\u201d that Democrats looked to address.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats point out that the legislation delivers a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal workers, increases the current spending for the census by a $1 billion, and provides $17 billion for new infrastructure projects.\n\nBut regardless of who\u2019s actually winning on the policy, Democrats are almost certainly winning on the politics.\n\nDemocratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats would support the deal, which seemed to square with what progressives said as well. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of the most liberal voices in Congress, told HuffPost he was \u201cinclined to be supportive\u201d and predicted that only \u201ca handful\u201d of Democrats would vote no.\n\nAnother California progressive, Rep. Jared Huffman, also predicted a small number of defections and said he was \u201cprobably a yes.\u201d\n\nWhile Huffman expressed concern about a few provisions and Democrats muddying their moral argument against walls \u2015 \u201cThere\u2019s a small amount of mud that I will concede\u201d \u2015 he said he thought this was overall a pretty good deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody should be claiming this as a victory, certainly not a complete victory, but I think there is a recognition that you can\u2019t fight every battle as your last one,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd plenty of other progressive Democrats seemed to be on the same page Wednesday. The only Democrat HuffPost talked to who seemed to be leaning no \u2015 though said she was still undecided \u2015 was Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). The freshman congresswoman said she was particularly concerned about accountability and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut if Democratic leaders can contain their defections to single digits, it will certainly seem like Democrats won this deal, particularly if a significant number of Republicans also defect from their leaders and vote no.\n\nI don\u2019t know that anybody should be claiming this as a victory, certainly not a complete victory, but I think there is a recognition that you can\u2019t fight every battle as your last one. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.)\n\nWhile only a handful of Democrats look poised to break ranks, dozens of Republicans seem prepared to do so, even with Trump supporting the bill.\n\nIf Trump started trashing the deal \u2015 or just sounding more tepid than he already does \u2015 Republicans defections could multiply. Suddenly, this bipartisan deal could look like a huge win for Democrats and a big loss for Republicans, just by virtue of a nearly united Democratic caucus voting for the bill and Republicans splitting off.\n\nMost members of the Freedom Caucus already sounded uncomfortable with the legislation before its release, and there are even members recycling the old complaint that there won\u2019t be enough time to \u201cRead The Bill\u201d before they vote on it.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do a one-week [continuing resolution] so we can all read it and know what\u2019s in it, fund the government, and make an informed vote? That would be fabulous,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told HuffPost Wednesday.\n\nBut, as long as Trump continues to say positive \u2015 or, at least, not negative \u2015 things about the agreement, the bill should sail through both chambers with large majorities. The House and the Senate could both vote on the measure as soon as Thursday, and even if more Democrats turn sour on the bill, there should be plenty of support from both parties to not make anyone sweat another shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-public-lands-ocasio-cortez_us_5c61de18e4b028d54316c422": "Starting in 1933, during the heart of the Great Depression, hundreds of thousands of young, unmarried men went to work for the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of several federal programs created as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. They built bridges, dams, roads, fire lookouts and other infrastructure.\n\nThey also planted trees \u2015 3 billion of them \u2015 in national forests and throughout the Great Plains to protect farms from Dust Bowl storms. By the time the CCC shuttered in 1943, the wildly popular program, nicknamed \u201cRoosevelt\u2019s Tree Army,\u201d had employed more than 3 million people and vastly improved America\u2019s public lands.\n\nIt\u2019s a success story that supporters of the Green New Deal are now looking to as they push for a rapid national mobilization to stave off catastrophic climate change.\n\nAchieving the goals of the Green New Deal will require more than eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity and building sectors, said Evan Weber, political and policy director of the Sunrise Movement, the climate activist group that stormed Democratic leaders\u2019 offices late last year to push the plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to help nature play a big role in making up the difference by absorbing and storing more carbon,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nWeber added that today\u2019s movement can draw inspiration from the CCC and other federally backed job creation programs.\n\n\u201cWe must create new programs and policies to protect and restore degraded and threatened ecosystems, and support landowners and farmers to invest in sustainable agricultural and land practices that can also help improve their bottom line,\u201d Weber said.\n\nThe Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution unveiled Thursday by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), already has more than 60 Democratic co-sponsors. An early set of guiding principles, it outlines lofty goals of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, building climate-resilient infrastructure and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs.\n\nWhile the document includes few details about how to accomplish these goals, it makes clear that public lands and waters will be key.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this undated file photo, a large fir tree heads to the forest floor after it is cut by an unidentified logger in the Umpqua National Forest near Oakridge, Oregon.\n\nThe non-binding measure requires \u201censuring that public lands, waters, and oceans are protected\u201d and \u201crestoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and fragile ecosystems through locally appropriate and science-based projects that enhance biodiversity and support climate resiliency.\u201d It demands that all U.S. residents are provided with \u201cclean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.\u201d And instead of relying on emerging technologies to suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, it calls for \u201crestoring natural ecosystems through proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage,\u201d including large-scale land preservation and planting new forests in treeless areas.\n\n\u201cThe success of the Green New Deal is intrinsically linked to how well we can protect and restore our public lands and waters,\u201d Markey told HuffPost in an email Monday. \u201cIf we fail, these precious resources will be forever altered. Solutions that include national parks and wild lands will also bring diverse coalitions together and will be critical to the climate mobilization effort.\u201d\n\nIt is yet to be seen what sort of public land policy proposals surface as part of this framework. But conservation groups are applauding the measure\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cThe resolution recognizes that public lands and waters are a cornerstone of any comprehensive strategy for solving the climate crisis,\u201d Kate Kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a former Interior Department official in the Obama administration, said via email. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: we can\u2019t afford to continue to drill away our natural heritage \u2014 and we should protect the land and waters that will help protect us from the impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nApproximately one-quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel extraction on federal lands, according to a federal report released by the Trump administration in November.\n\nWeber said it is time the federal government end its practice of leasing lands for fossil fuel production at below market value, and instead explore boosting renewable energy development that helps protect ecosystems, species and indigenous lands.\n\nJust as public lands can be a major driver of climate change, they can also be a tool for combating it.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images A pumpjack operates above an oil well in the Bakken Formation outside Williston, North Dakota, U.S., on Friday, March 9, 2018\n\nIn a January op-ed in High Country News, Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, urged backers of the Green New Deal to not forget about public lands in their pursuit of climate action. And Jad Daley, president and CEO of conservation organization American Forests, published an op-ed last week in The Hill in which he writes that \u201cmany [Green New Deal] champions are overlooking the huge potential\u201d of forests to reduce planetary-warming emissions and create jobs.\n\n\u201cFor a Green New Deal to be the \u2018real deal,\u2019 it must embrace forests,\u201d Daley wrote.\n\nAt a press conference last week to introduce the resolution, Ocasio-Cortez talked about the importance of environmental protection in fossil fuel-dependent communities like those in Appalachia. But she and Markey did not mention the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through changes in public land management and ecosystem restoration.\n\n\u201cThe resolution is silent on any individual technology which can move us toward a solution on this problem,\u201d Markey said at the press conference. \u201cThis is a resolution that does not have individual prescriptions in it.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s office did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nA 2016 study found that humans wiped out 10 percent of Earth\u2019s wilderness areas over just two decades. And a dire report by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that solving the climate crisis will require removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, in addition to a rapid global effort to scale back fossil fuels. The IPCC examined several pathways to keep the planet\u2019s average temperature from warming 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, considered the aspirational goal of the 2015 Paris climate treaty. All pathways required not only stopping deforestation but increasing Earth\u2019s forested areas. And depending on the scale of emissions reductions, the effort could require adding as many as 3.86 million square miles \u2015 an area slightly larger than the U.S. \u2015 of forest by 2050.\n\n\u201cYou need to have forestry on your side,\u201d Drew Shindell, a climate science professor at Duke University and a co-author of the IPCC report, told HuffPost at the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal is wildly popular among both Republican and Democratic voters, as HuffPost previously reported.

The lawmaker, who became one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress in November, wrote a tweet Sunday night in which she suggested American support for Israel was merely about money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d Omar wrote in reply to a tweet from journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was commenting on Republican support for pro-Israeli policies.\n\nCritics from both parties, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said the statement played into negative stereotypes about Jewish people.\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,\u201d Pelosi and other House Democrats said in a statement. \u201cWe condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.\u201d\n\nOmar issued an apology on Monday, saying anti-Semitism was \u201creal\u201d and that she was \u201cgrateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is why I unequivocally apologize.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker also apologized last month for another tweet about Israel sent in 2012 in which she said the country had \u201chypnotized the world.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-trump-el-paso_us_5c620e38e4b028d543172ca8": "EL PASO, Texas \u2015 Thousands are expected to turn out Monday night to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall and his insistence that this overwhelmingly Democratic city is the best place to make the case for it.\n\nThe protests set up a clash between Trump and a potential opponent in 2020: Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, a born-and-raised El Pasoan who is speaking at the protest set up as counter-programming to the president\u2019s Monday evening rally in the city.\n\nO\u2019Rourke insisted Monday that his appearance at the protest wasn\u2019t a personal challenge to Trump and instead was meant to be in support of the more than 50 community groups that organized the march.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s here in an effort to use this community as a prop to make his case for the border wall,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told reporters on a call.\n\nThe competing protest clearly got the president\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWe have a line that is very long already,\u201d Trump said before leaving Washington for El Paso. \u201cI mean, you see what\u2019s going on.

Some 74 percent of voters in El Paso County cast ballots for O\u2019Rourke in a midterm election that saw a surge of turnout.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz ended in defeat but dramatically altered Texas politics by spurring a surge in turnout along the border and narrowing the Republican margin of victory in a key statewide race to less than 3 percentage points. His ability to get new voters to the polls and out-fundraise his opponent without accepting PAC money stoked enthusiasm for a presidential run even before the U.S. Senate race ended. He recently said he would make a decision on a presidential bid later this month.\n\nBut, save a few public appearances, he remained largely out of the spotlight until Trump cast his sights on El Paso.\n\nTrump cited El Paso in his State of the Union speech last week as evidence of the need for border wall funding, inaccurately claiming that the city was among the country\u2019s most violent until the federal government began fencing it off from its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. (In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nTrump is expected to make further exaggerations on Monday evening in hopes of winning support for $5.7 billion to begin building a border wall. His impasse with Congress over the funding led to the recent 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, El Paso officials and community leaders will try to present the city as they know it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to follow the community\u2019s lead....

However, the poll did not mention specifics about Trump\u2019s remarks. The data also indicated that 71 percent of the audience believed there was a crisis on the border.\n\nThe proposed border funding agreement still requires Trump\u2019s signature by midnight on Friday if it is to pass and avert a second government shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/esquires-interview-of-white-american-boy-during-black-history-month-stirs-controversy_us_5c62ca3de4b0ab4bc4e2ad37": "Esquire has found itself embroiled in controversy on social media after a piece about a young white, middle-class teenager was chosen as the focal point for a piece on growing up in America in the March issue of the magazine, which was released during February \u2015 Black History Month.\n\nThe piece follows 17-year-old high school senior Ryan Morgan from West Bend, Wisconsin. Morgan is featured in a powerful cover image on the March 2019 issue of Esquire. Overlaid over the image of Morgan, who is donning both a button-down and a hoodie and holding a sneaker, is the text: \u201cAn American Boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country,\u201d it reads.\n\nReaders are given a rundown of Morgan\u2019s day-to-day, which includes his retelling of an altercation with a female classmate, an AP exam, interactions with his girlfriend, Kaitlyn, and his feelings.\n\nIn one section that unpacks how Morgan, who lives in a predominately Trump-voting territory, feels politically. He says that \u201clast year was really bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say anything without pissing someone off ... Lots of drama over politics,\u201d he says. \u201cIt ruined friendships and changed social groups. People were making friends based on their politics more than anything.\u201d reads the piece, which says that, surprisingly, the most popular opinion at Morgan\u2019s high school was \u201canti-Trump.\u201d\n\nThe piece goes on to say: \u201cRyan, raised in Republican households, was surprised by the vitriol. \u2018Everyone hates me because I support Trump?\u2019 he says. \u2018I couldn\u2019t debate anyone without being shut down and called names. Like, what did I do wrong?\u2019\u201d\n\nLater, we learn Morgan identifies as moderate: \u201cIt\u2019s better to be a moderate, because then you don\u2019t get heat.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s no question that being a child in today\u2019s cultural climate is difficult, this reporter and many people on Twitter were confused as to why the magazine chose to profile a white boy in lieu of, say, any other American teenager. There are countless narratives of white men in history. Why, in 2019, are we adding yet another?\n\nBecause you know what we don\u2019t discuss nearly enough?

Add to this the passions and change this moment has unleashed \u2014 #MeToo, gender fluidity, Black Lives Matter, \u2018check your privilege,\u2019 and #TheFutureIsFemale \u2014 and the task of grappling with the world has to be more complicated for kids than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d writes Fielden, who goes on to explain that his son has played a game in class that intrigued him.\n\nThe game divided the classroom into zones named \u201cStrongly Agree,\u201d \u201cStrongly Disagree,\u201d \u201cKind of Agree,\u201d \u201cKind of Disagree.\u201d Kids who felt \u201cI Don\u2019t Know\u201d could stand in the middle of the room.

Tom Suozzi said he plans to co-sponsor the Green New Deal.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) is backing the Green New Deal.\n\nOn Monday the moderate Long Island Democrat told HuffPost he plans to add his name to the nearly 70 House Democrats co-sponsoring the sweeping resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) released last Thursday.\n\n\u201cRep. Suozzi supports the Green New Deal,\u201d said Jay Bhargava, Suozzi\u2019s press secretary.\n\nSuozzi\u2019s support is notable because he occupies a seat on the influential House Committee on Ways and Means, the oldest congressional decision-making panel, with jurisdiction over taxation, international trade agreements and social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare and unemployment benefits.\n\nThe joint resolution stakes out an ambitious agenda for any Green New Deal legislation, calling for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every major sector of the economy, providing clean energy jobs to millions of Americans and vastly expanding the social safety net.\n\nSuozzi is also the vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, meaning he could help woo Republican support for a Green New Deal.\n\nIn November, when Ocasio-Cortez championed a resolution to establish a select committee in the House on a Green New Deal, Suozzi supported the effort. He called the project \u201cdaunting\u201d but said in a Facebook post, \u201cThe real question is, can we afford not to enact the Green New Deal?\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution, outlining the core tenets of what should be included in future legislation, arrived to considerable fanfare, dramatically shifting the terms of the climate policy debate away from carbon pricing schemes toward the kind of aggressive government action scientists say matches the scale of the problem.\n\nThe resolution ran into some controversy in the days that followed. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released the resolution to reporters on Wednesday night with a separate FAQ document that seemed to contradict some aspects of the resolution, including taking stances on nuclear energy and farming emissions that didn\u2019t appear in the official document. She tweeted Saturday \u201ca draft version that got uploaded + taken down,\u201d but questions remain.\n\nYet the speed with which Democrats are lining up to support the resolution anyway speaks to the crisis it aims to address. A large contingent of the New York delegation already co-sponsored the resolution, and districts like Suozzi\u2019s, which stretches along the North Shore of Long Island from Queens into Suffolk County, face catastrophic risks from sea level rise and more violent storms.\n\nIt also speaks to the popularity of the Green New Deal\u2019s stated goals. In a poll released in December, 81 percent of surveyed registered voters said they support its aims \u2014 including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans. A survey from this month found a narrow majority of voters supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal.\n\nIn January a majority of Democratic voters polled in New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District, which stretches along the opposite shore of Long Island from Suozzi\u2019s, said they would support a primary challenger to moderate Rep. Kathleen Rice if she did not support a Green New Deal. A spokesman for her did not immediately respond to an email asking if she would join Suozzi in backing the resolution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see so much support for the Green New Deal,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the left-wing group Justice Democrats, which has pushed the resolution. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what just a few primary challenges can accomplish for saving our economy and planet for working people in this country.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-el-paso-donald-trump_us_5c62280fe4b071a3b765ef7e": "EL PASO, Texas \u2015 Beto O\u2019Rourke directly challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration policies and painted the administration\u2019s efforts to build a wall along the southern border as dangerous and divisive during a rally Monday night.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of thousands within sight of the El Paso County Coliseum, where Trump spoke, the former Democratic congressman delivered an energized speech that recalled those he delivered in his unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign, a contest that vaulted him to the national stage. Amid wide expectation that he will launch a bid for the presidential nomination in 2020, O\u2019Rourke evoked key themes he honed while campaigning across the state \u2015 calling for a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and urging the country to welcome asylum seekers.\n\nIn stark contrast to Trump\u2019s doomsday vision of a crime-infested region under assault from foreign criminals, O\u2019Rourke offered a glowing vision of the border zone. Noting that migrants are statistically less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, O\u2019Rourke insisted that cities like El Paso, his hometown, are among the country\u2019s safest precisely because of their strong immigrant presence.\n\n\u201cIn El Paso, we are secure because we treat one another with dignity and respect. That is the way that we make our communities and our country safe,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at the event. \u201cWe know that walls do not save lives.

It doesn't get more symbolic than this. pic.twitter.com/CTnKThq2kh \u2014 Roque Planas (@RoqPlanas) February 12, 2019\n\nThe speech marked O\u2019Rourke\u2019s first foray onto the national stage since conceding the Senate race to Republican Ted Cruz in November. Since then, he has maintained a low profile, rarely speaking to the press and offering only oblique remarks about whether he will launch a presidential bid. He told Oprah Winfrey earlier this month that he would decide before the month was out \u2015 a remark he repeated to supporters who shouted the question at him during Monday\u2019s event.\n\nBut the crowd seemed optimistic. Several people waved flags reading \u201cBeto for president\u201d or \u201cBeto 2020.\u201d The banners employed the same black-and-white graphics used in his Senate race, which saw voter turnout more than double in some border counties.\n\nO\u2019Rourke addressed the crowd at the same time Trump took the stage for his own rally just a few miles away. The president flew to the border city to make yet another public demand for $5.7 billion to begin construction on a border wall. Similar demands led to the country\u2019s longest government shutdown shortly before Christmas and lawmakers have been stymied thus far in their efforts to negotiate with the White House on a government funding package that would keep the nation running for the rest of the year.\n\nTrump cited El Paso in his State of the Union speech last week in an appeal to obtain money for the border wall, falsely claiming that the city was among the country\u2019s most violent until the federal government began fencing it off from its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. (In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nIt was those remarks, along with Trump\u2019s choice to hold a campaign rally in the heavily Latino border town, that prompted more than 50 civil rights and advocacy groups to organize the rally where O\u2019Rourke delivered the final address.\n\nTrump doubled down on his calls for a wall on Monday, saying his plans along the Rio Grande separating the U.S. and Mexico were already moving forward.\n\n\u201cToday we started a big beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande,\u201d Trump told supporters at the event, which was filled to capacity. \u201cRight smack on the Rio Grande.\u201d\n\nThe size of the crowds at the dual rallies symbolized a wider schism between the values of two social movements that will likely define the politics of 2020 \u2015 one fixated on security that views the border as a threat and an alternate view that champions openness.\n\nThe president addressed the lawmaker\u2019s competing event before flying out of Washington, telling reporters that he had a \u201cvery long\u201d line at his rally and that, though O\u2019Rourke had one too, \u201cit\u2019s a tiny, little line.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally, however, began with a large march through El Paso. Organizers estimated the crowd numbered 7,000 at its peak, citing law enforcement figures.\n\nAbout 7,000 on hand for @BetoORourke in El Paso tonight, per organizers, citing a law enforcement estimate pic.twitter.com/s5ldYnol5v \u2014 David Siders (@davidsiders) February 12, 2019\n\nJohn Campa, 30, said he had never attended a rally until two weeks ago. Monday night\u2019s march was his second, and he anticipated he would join more in the future because of Trump\u2019s hostility toward his hometown.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I don\u2019t like what he has to say about El Paso,\u201d Campa told HuffPost. \u201cEl Paso Is love. We gotta make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nRally-goers at times chanted \u201cno more lies\u201d as they followed O\u2019Rourke during the march, which numbered in the thousands, according to estimates by local media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re a community that\u2019s proud to be inclusive, proud to be welcoming \u201d said Robert Heyman, policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to stand against President Trump\u2019s racism, against Trump\u2019s wall.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke challenged his supporters to champion policies of inclusion during his speech, painting El Paso as a city built around community, not division.\n\n\u201cWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe are going to show the country who we are.

Elizabeth Warren officially announced her presidential bid near the banks of the Merrimack River here on Saturday, picking a highly symbolic location that points to both long, worker-centric political tradition Warren seeks to inherit and the challenge she might face in winning over an increasingly diverse Democratic party.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way,\u201d Warren said at the Everett Mills, where a group of Polish women walked off the job in January 1912, setting off the famous Bread and Roses Strike, when tens of thousands of immigrant workers united to shut down the city\u2019s textile mills for the winter, winning substantial raises and safer work conditions.\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Elizabeth Warren is done exploring. She's running for president.\n\nWarren\u2019s official entry into the race to win the Democratic nod to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 has been expected since she announced the formation of an exploratory committee in late December. She joins a field that already includes three of her fellow Democratic senators \u2015 New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker, California\u2019s Kamala Harris and New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand \u2015 and could soon include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, along with a host of other candidates.\n\nShe launched her campaign with an introduction from Rep. Joe Kennedy III, winning the blessing of the highest-profile member of the first family of Democratic politics, and with the backing of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and fellow Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole,\u201d said Kennedy, a former student of Warren\u2019s at Harvard Law School. \u201cA leader that will bring us together to confront our great threat: A system that protects the powerful and the privileged.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a practical reason to announce in Lawrence \u2015 it\u2019s a quick, 10-minute drive to New Hampshire, which hosts the first-in-the-nation primary \u2015 but the symbolic reasons to choose the former mill town 40 minutes north of Boston instead of a more prominent locale are stronger. The Bread and Roses Strike, which was led in large part by women, immigrants and immigrant women, is a rich historical text for Warren to invoke during a speech announcing her bid. It allows Warren to connect to a landmark moment in labor history, and it also links her directly to one of just a handful of majority-minority cities in her home state, giving her a chance to show her appeal to the voters who may ultimately decide the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about immigrants, it\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about workers\u2019 rights, it\u2019s about pay equity,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s about everything Elizabeth Warren has spent her life fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe Bread and Roses strike began in response to a pay cut of 32 cents a week. The roughly 30,000 people who worked in the mills were crowded into tenement houses, having arrived in Lawrence from more than 50 different nations. Seven of eight people who worked in the mills were either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

While doctors in Lawrence had a life expectancy of 65, more than one-third of mill workers died before age 25.\n\nThe strike quickly led to clashes with local police, and a state militia was called in. The Industrial Workers of the World organized the strikers, and soon news of the strike was dominating the nation\u2019s newspapers. Wealthy suffragettes, believing their struggle for the right to vote was linked to that of the strikers, began supporting them financially. To draw additional attention to the cause, the mothers of Lawrence sent their children by train to New York City, a so-called \u201cChildren\u2019s Exodus.\u201d The sight of the malnourished children drew more sympathy to the strikers\u2019 cause. In late February, as a second group of children prepared to leave for Philadelphia, police began clubbing them and their parents. The violence drew further condemnation, and soon both the U.S. House and Senate began investigating the conditions in Lawrence.\n\nIn March, owners agreed to a 15 percent raise for the mill workers, to give double pay for overtime and to improve safety conditions in the mills. The eventual agreement ending the strike was read aloud in Arabic, Polish, Armenian and a slew of other languages, reflecting the diversity of the strikers.\n\nJournalist Bruce Watson, in his book on the strike, \u201cBread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream,\u201d wrote that in 1912, \u201cthe great rudder of a stable society, the middle class, had not yet been invented.\u201d But within months of the end of the strike, Warren noted, Massachusetts became the first state in the country with a minimum wage, part of a newly empowered labor movement that would soon win a 40-hour work week and the elimination of child labor.\n\nIn Warren\u2019s telling of American history, the middle class that the strike helped create over the following decades has fallen by the wayside. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident. It wasn\u2019t inevitable,\u201d she said, pointing the finger at power-hungry lobbyists, misguided Republicans and the corrupting influence of corporate money on politics that she said had derailed progress on everything from gun control to climate change. \u201cOver the years, America\u2019s middle class had been deliberately hollowed out.\u201d\n\nTo fix it, Warren argues, involves more than throwing Trump out of office, and requires a more aggressive form of liberal politics. \u201cToday, millions and millions and millions of American families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well-connected,\u201d she said during her 40-minute speech. \u201cCorruption is a cancer on our democracy. And we will get rid of it only with strong medicine \u2015 with real, structural reform.\u201d\n\nBut Lawrence\u2019s story is as much about immigration as it is about labor. \u201cThe city of Lawrence symbolizes what our country stands for. The wave after wave of immigrants who come to this country seeking a better life,\u201d said Juana Matias, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who previously represented Lawrence in the Massachusetts State House. \u201cWarren coming to Lawrence demonstrates the commitment she has to the middle class.\u201d\n\nInstead of the polyglot immigrant community that existed in 1912, Lawrence today is dominated by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and emigres from Puerto Rico. The city, which is nearly three-quarters Latino in a state that is roughly three-quarters white, has struggled. A 2014 story in Boston Magazine labeled it \u201cThe City of the Damned,\u201d documenting a state takeover of the city\u2019s failing public schools, a high crime rate and the corruption investigations plaguing its then-mayor, William Lantigua.\n\nIt has also become a favorite target of Republican attacks. In a 2018 speech in New Hampshire, Trump blamed Lawrence and Boston by name for the deadly opioid epidemic ravaging New England. Chris Sununu, New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor, has used similar rhetoric. Most famously, former Maine Gov. Paul LePage blamed his state\u2019s problems with fentanyl on black and Latino people from Lawrence and nearby Lowell.\n\nMatias said things are improving in the city, with better schools and less crime under new mayor Daniel Rivera, who spoke before Warren. A small number of biotech and other firms have moved into the massive mill buildings along the river, but the city remains one of the poorest in the state.\n\nLawrence\u2019s large Latino population \u2015 Trump signaled it out because of its status as sanctuary city where local police don\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2015 also provides Warren with an opportunity to show her appeal to voters of color. Massachusetts\u2019 limited number of black and Latino voters means Warren still needs to show she can appeal to voters outside her core base of white progressives.\n\nAfter making her way onstage to Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201c9 to 5,\u201d Warren ticked off a host of policy priorities \u2015 from making it easier to join a union to outlawing gerrymandering to criminal justice reform, but repeatedly returned to her core message of rebuilding the middle class, which she emphasized could appeal to voters across the socioeconomic spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe come from different backgrounds, different religions, different languages, different experiences,\u201d she told the crowd of roughly 3,500 people who braved freezing temperatures to attend the rally. \u201cWe feel the urgency of this moment in different ways. But today, we come together, ready to raise our voices until this fight is won.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Warren is set to travel to New Hampshire and then Iowa this weekend, and she has trips to South Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and California planned for the coming weeks.\n\nRepublicans responded to Warren\u2019s campaign launch by focusing on the controversy over the senator\u2019s claims to Native American ancestry, which gained new steam this week after The Washington Post reported she identified as Native American on a form filed with the Texas State Bar.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has already been exposed as a fraud by the Native Americans she impersonated and disrespected to advance her professional career, and the people of Massachusetts she deceived to get elected,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nBut there is no evidence Warren\u2019s ancestry claims helped her advance her career, and little evidence it will significantly hamper her in the Democratic primary. National and state-level polls place her in the middle of a crowded field. Most have the best-known candidates, Biden and Sanders, leading the field.\n\nThis story has been updated with more details from Warren\u2019s announcement.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-semitic-attacks-synagogue-safety_us_5c50c081e4b0f43e410be56b": "In October, an anti-Semite carrying three handguns and a semiautomatic weapon stormed into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Robert Bowers, incensed that Jews were interfering with the president\u2019s efforts to \u201cmake America great again\u201d and furious that the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society was bringing \u201cinvaders in that kill our people,\u201d stands accused of killing 11 worshippers. Twenty-two of the 63 federal charges he now faces are punishable by death.\n\nThe shooting is now considered the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. For many American Jews like me, it represented a declaration of a new normal.\n\nFor decades, \u201cthe breadth of acceptance accorded U.S. Jews was indeed exceptional, probably unique,\u201d explained David Berger, dean of the Bernard Revel Graduate School at Yeshiva University. For many people, the Pittsburgh killings were the latest sign that acceptance was starting to fade, triggering fears that the United States, an inspirational refuge for so many American Jews\u2019 grandparents and great-grandparents, could no longer protect us.\n\nAnd so, increasingly and across the country, American Jews are taking steps to protect ourselves.\n\nWithin hours of the shooting in Pittsburgh, Secure Community Network, a nonprofit partner of the Jewish Federations of North America that responds to incidents and provides security assessments to synagogues and other Jewish institutions, arrived on scene to assist authorities. Centralized synagogue movements fielded hundreds of calls from anxious congregational leaders. Within two months of the shooting, Community Security Service, a nonprofit collaboration of former military and security professionals that trains Jewish volunteers to protect their institutions, recorded an 150 percent increase in volunteers going through its training. Nearly 1,000 American Jewish people attended basic security concepts programs in multiple states, according to Jason Friedman, the executive director of CSS.\n\nEven gun use, once a backburner topic quietly discussed in the private confines of rabbis\u2019 offices, is now something widely debated in the American Jewish community.\n\nHow We Got Here\n\nJewish people have been persecuted for millennia. But anti-Semitic incidents in the United States have increased dramatically in recent years. And as life has become more dangerous for Jewish Americans over the last decade \u2015 especially in the two years since Donald Trump was elected president \u2015 synagogues and other Jewish establishments have struggled to define what \u201cpreparedness\u201d should look like.\n\nIn 2006, I worked at Gratz College, a school of Jewish studies outside Philadelphia whose open campus housed several Jewish agencies, including a day school. Impressively unqualified, and inspired by a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\u2019 report that called anti-Semitic incidents a \u201cserious problem\u201d on college campuses throughout the nation, I declared myself Gratz\u2019s director of institutional security, attended training with the Philadelphia anti-terrorism chief, and put in place some new security features, including a video surveillance system.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember now, but at the time, just half a decade after the 9/11 attacks, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d was more often than not a euphemism for a very specific type of violence \u2014 the al Qaeda and al Qaeda-inspired kind. At the time, Jewish organizations, and most Americans, weren\u2019t particularly focused on the threat of wannabe Nazis and other domestic terrorists.\n\nThe election of Barack Obama changed all that. White supremacists, enraged and threatened by the emergence of the first black president, revived a disingenuous, if not quite buried, decades-old narrative: Jews, immigrants of color and minorities would take the country from a helpless white majority. By 2012, anti-Semitic incidents perpetuated by neo-Nazis, skinheads, white supremacists and white nationalist sympathizers outpaced those of decentralized jihadis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, 2017.\n\nThen Trump ran \u2014 and won, with the Republican Party running an anti-Semitic ad as part of his closing message. Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise when he said there \u201cwere very fine people on both sides\u201d of a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman was killed while protesting against racism.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the president of the United States had poured rocket fuel onto simmering, anti-Semitic embers. Trump\u2019s words normalized the white men marching through the streets with tiki torches, chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d\n\nIncidents against the Jewish community increased 57 percent from 2016 to 2017, the largest uptick in 20 years and the largest single-year increase in history, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n\u201cRising anger within the right-wing community is, right now, greater that it was, let\u2019s say, a decade ago,\u201d said David Friedman, the vice president of law enforcement and community security at the ADL. \u201cAnd since Jews are and Jewish institutions are one of the things that the right-wing focuses on, they consider Jews to have a particularly significant role in what they regard [as] \u2014 and they used this expression in Charlottesville \u2014 \u2018taking away their country.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow American Jews Have Responded\n\nAmerican Jewish institutions have responded to the rising threat of anti-Semitism in different ways. After the Pittsburgh shooting, my former colleagues at Gratz College immediately participated in a communitywide security meeting that included representatives from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Philadelphia Police Department. Gratz held its first active-shooter drill weeks later.\n\nThe Jewish Federation of Broward County has been securing its facility for several years, stopping vehicles at a checkpoint and allowing security staff to check visitors\u2019 identification. In some cases, cars have been searched. Visitors and staff encounter locked doors around the perimeter of the building. The organization is currently helping large synagogues and small neighborhood congregations assess their security needs.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rabbi Chuck Diamond arrives on the street corner outside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Nov. 3, 2018, to lead a Shabbat morning service one week after 11 people were killed and six wounded in a shooting at the synagogue.\n\nThe JFBC increased its incident response after the Pittsburgh shooting, adding tabletop exercises and first aid refresher courses. The institution added more immediate response trainings for campus security guards and changed the building layout to accommodate safety retreat zones.\n\nRabbi Yaakov Saacks, director of the Chai Center, a synagogue in Dix Hills, New York, started securing his facility well before the Tree of Life incident.\n\n\u201cWhat did it for us was the shooting at Marjory Stoneman,\u201d Saacks said, referring to last year\u2019s mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. \u201cThis was six, eight months before Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nHis infrastructure improvements include video camera upgrades, panic buttons, an access control system and shatterproof windows. Armed guards patrol the preschool.\n\nShould Your Rabbi Pack Heat?\n\nThen there\u2019s the subject of guns. The issue is as divisive within this community as it is the country.\n\nMel Bernstein, a Jewish owner of Dragonman\u2019s gun shop in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has offered free AR-15s, ammunition and training to local rabbis. He said four of the seven synagogues he approached have taken him up on the offer.\n\nUnarmed congregants are sitting ducks who must \u201chave a tool\u201d to fight back, he argues.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say there\u2019s a fire in a synagogue, what to you do? You grab a fire extinguisher. Let\u2019s say somebody comes in and starts shooting everybody. What are you going to grab? You grab your AR-15,\u201d Bernstein told local news channel KOAA 5 in November.\n\nIf a neo-Nazi ever wants to bring me down, it\u2019s not going to be as easy as it was in 1942. Rabbi Yaakov Saacks, director of the Chai Center\n\nSaaks, the Chai Center rabbi, owns a shotgun.\n\n\u201cIf a neo-Nazi ever wants to bring me down, it\u2019s not going to be as easy as it was in 1942,\u201d he said.\n\nMany congregants at the the Chai Center disagree with his position \u2014 and many other leaders of Jewish organizations in the U.S. have been reluctant to go as far as Saacks has. The JFBC, for example, issued a statement calling for \u201ccommon sense gun reform\u201d shortly after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which is in the area.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the debate of \u2018should civilians within congregations be armed?\u2019 Which we don\u2019t necessarily advocate,\u201d said Michael Balaban, the JFBC president and CEO. The federation does not have a formal position on armed congregants, but Balaban said he would urge synagogues to use trained professionals \u201crather than civilians.\u201d\n\nWith or without guns, an institutional culture of security is no longer optional.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-iowa-caucus-democrats-love-progressive-patriotism_us_5c6056f2e4b0f9e1b17e458b": "WATERLOO, Iowa \u2015 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s favorite presidential campaign-trail yarn \u2015 and he has a lot of them \u2015 is about how his parents, two of IBM\u2019s first black executives, overcame housing market discrimination to raise him and his brother in a predominantly white neighborhood in one of his state\u2019s suburbs.\n\n\n\nAs an adult, Booker likes to recall, he asked Arthur Lessman, the white lawyer who helped his parents outsmart a racist real estate agent, why the attorney was inspired to do it. It turned out that Lessman had volunteered his services after watching television one day in 1965 when the normal programming was interrupted by breaking footage of Alabama state troopers brutally bludgeoning black civil rights activists marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.\n\n\n\nRecounting the tale Friday afternoon to an audience of about 100 Democrats at a community college in Waterloo, Booker marveled at the far-reaching power of individual political sacrifices. It\u2019s a testament, he declared with excitement in his voice, to his deeply held belief that \u201clove is a radical force.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe marchers in Selma \u201cstood up for love of country and unleashed that energy and it instantaneously leapt a thousand miles and changed the heart of one man on a couch in New Jersey, who then would go on and change generations not yet born,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here right now because of that chain reaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same weekend that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to \u201cfight back\u201d against the \u201cclass warfare\u201d waged by the super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort.\n\n\n\nRather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy \u2015 an \u201cus\u201d against a proverbial \u201cthem\u201d \u2015 Booker focuses almost entirely on the \u201cus\u201d \u2015 on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement.\n\n\n\nBooker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States\u2019 forefathers \u201cimperfect geniuses\u201d for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not.\n\nI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it. Tom Swartz, former Iowa state representative, referring to Booker\n\nIn this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman\u2019s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism.\n\n\u201cIf we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,\u201d he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Booker\u2019s appeals to America\u2019s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders\u2019 work of forming a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama\u2019s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job.\n\nOn Booker\u2019s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it,\u201d said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown.\n\nAfter the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren\u2019s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.)\n\nBut Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump\u2019s invective.\n\n\u201cIt probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,\u201d Blaisdell said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Charlie Neibergall Booker minged with voters at the First Congregational United Church of Christ on Friday in Mason City, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I Had To Run Something\u2019\n\nBooker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders \u2015 which includes several of his Senate colleagues. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have announced their candidacies; Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs.\n\nBooker, whose mother\u2019s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party\u2019s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cMy story is your story,\u201d he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class.\n\nBooker tells story of his Iowa roots. His ancestors moved from Alabama to mining town of Buxton; grandmother grew up in Des Moines. pic.twitter.com/lnrwamvd3V \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nMany of the Iowans who came to hear Booker speak knew him already from his dramatic, televised confrontations with Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s confirmation hearings last year.\n\nHe burnished his credentials among many Democrats when he released a memo Kavanaugh had written on racial profiling after the Republican-controlled committee refused to publicize it and barred Booker from questioning the nominee about it. On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a \u201cSpartacus moment,\u201d a reference that left observers quizzical.\n\nRegardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI had to run something,\u201d Booker said in Marshalltown. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nThe experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate.\n\nBooker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing.\n\nGrassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country\u2019s system of law enforcement and incarceration.\n\nRather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\u201cSome people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. \u201cWell, I ran a fire department. That\u2019s not going to be a constructive strategy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Susan Walsh Booker cajoles Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to join him in an Instagram Live post in December. Looking on is Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nShrugging Off Criticism From The Left\n\nOf course, Booker\u2019s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term \u201cWall Street\u201d \u2015 a favorite target of attack among his party\u2019s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.)\n\nIn his efforts to improve Newark\u2019s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good.\n\nBooker\u2019s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies.\n\nIn addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago.\n\nBooker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations.\n\nIn Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools.\n\nTime and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities.\n\nRather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor.\n\n\u201cI was like Malcolm X \u2014 by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,\u201d he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening.\n\nAt the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren.\n\nHe admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high. But rather than lower it to 21 percent from 35 percent, as the GOP measure did, he would have left it at 25 or 26 percent.\n\nAnd in a conversation that night about climate policy in Iowa City, he described nuclear energy as part of the solution.\n\nMore on climate change: He supports nuclear energy and thinks any climate bill must be bipartisan (unless there\u2019s a 60-vote Senate due to \u201cblue tsunami\u201d). This is at supporter\u2019s home in Iowa City. pic.twitter.com/GkkUZVa4E2 \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nBooker was keen to emphasize that action on what he sees as the country\u2019s most urgent priorities \u2015 such as universal health coverage and addressing climate change \u2015 would require either compromise with Republicans or a \u201cblue tsunami\u201d big enough to grant Democrats a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.\n\nBooker is a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation, which would replace private health insurance with a federal single-payer program. But on two occasions in Iowa, he suggested that the bill is an aspiration unlikely to be realized in the near future, given the constraints of GOP numbers in the Senate.\n\nSingle-payer health care \u201cis a goal we should shoot at,\u201d he told a crowd of 500 people at Kum & Go Theater in Des Moines on Saturday.\n\nIn the interim, he proposed backing a Medicare buy-in or lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age to 55 or 50.\n\nWhat Booker did not volunteer in his discussion is that he not only opposes efforts to abolish the filibuster in the Senate, he has promised to personally defend the practice if it came under assault.\n\nStill, many of the Democrats who attended Booker\u2019s events seemed either unaware of Booker\u2019s deviations from progressive orthodoxy or relatively unbothered by it after hearing him speak.\n\nShawn Harmsen, a 46-year-old journalism professor, hosted a campaign gathering for Booker at his home in Iowa City, where he prominently displayed a blue \u201cI [heart] public educators\u201d sign on his front lawn. Harmsen wants to know more about Booker\u2019s support for charter schools, but held out the possibility that such educational alternatives might be acceptable in circumstances \u201cwhere you have minority communities who are tired of waiting for the public school system.\u201d\n\nRoberta Rosheim, a 69-year-old retired school teacher and union activist, and her husband, David, 74, a seller of rare books, went into Booker\u2019s Des Moines town hall skeptical. Roberta had read about his support for charter schools and his past receipt of pharmaceutical industry money.\n\nBut Roberta said they emerged \u201cimpressed.\u201d\n\nDavid added, \u201cI thought he came out very much for public education.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matthew-whitaker-sheldon-adelson-trump_us_5c5df29ce4b0910c63f05e50": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Friday that nothing \u201ccorrupt\u201d occurred when the Department of Justice suddenly changed an eight-year-old legal interpretation in a way that clearly benefited President Donald Trump\u2019s biggest political donor, casino oligarch Sheldon Adelson.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) asked Whitaker whether he was involved in the January decision of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to alter an established legal interpretation of the Federal Wire Act in order to further limit online gambling and whether he had any communications with Adelson or any of the billionaire\u2019s lobbyists. The new opinion reversed a 2011 OLC interpretation of the act that had applied a prohibition on online gambling strictly to online betting on sports. State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.\n\nWhitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson.\n\n\u201cYour inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,\u201d the acting attorney general said.\n\nRaskin was not satisfied with Whitaker\u2019s answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThis definitely bears further investigation,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWhen and where and by whom remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Jamie Raskin questions acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker at a congressional hearing on Feb. 8, 2019.\n\nThe investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLC\u2019s sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.\n\nSheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.\n\nMore recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.\n\nThe revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNow some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should \u201cwithdraw its opinion\u201d because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.\n\nBesides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senate\u2019s confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trump\u2019s choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sheldon Adelson attends a White House ceremony to see his wife, Miriam, receive the Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in November 2018.\n\nSince 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation \u2015 which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore \u2015 has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.\n\nSo Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesn\u2019t campaign on the grounds that Adelson\u2019s hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.\n\nThe Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal. But bills introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) floundered in Congress amid opposition from both parties and lobbying from those casino companies that had invested in online gaming. Adelson\u2019s lobbying group then focused on convincing the Justice Department to simply issue a new legal opinion overturning the old one.\n\nCharles Cooper, a Washington lawyer working for Adelson, lobbied the Justice Department, sending a memo in 2017 that made the legal argument for upending the 2011 opinion, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nJanuary\u2019s reversal wasn\u2019t the first big victory for Adelson under the Trump administration. Adelson is a longtime supporter of right-wing political parties in Israel and the idea of locating the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. In May 2018, he was a guest of honor at the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump decided to move it from Tel Aviv.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal_us_5c588e7fe4b09293b20730d7": "The Green New Deal is finally taking form.\n\nOn Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) unveiled a landmark resolution cementing the pillars of an unprecedented program to zero out planet-warming emissions and restore the middle-class prosperity of postwar America that the original New Deal helped spur.\n\nJust three months after calls for a Green New Deal electrified a long-stagnant debate on climate policy, the Democratic lawmakers released the six-page document outlining plans to cut global emissions 40 to 60 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and neutralize human-caused greenhouse gases entirely by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday is a big day for workers in Appalachia,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cToday is a good day for children who have been breathing dirty air in the Bronx.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious, if measured, clarion call for action that, if accomplished, would transform the United States into the leader in decarbonizing and clear a path forward for the world to avert catastrophic warming.\n\nThe joint resolution stakes out a \u201cten-year national mobilization\u201d plan to build \u201csmart\u201d grids and rapidly increase the share of American power generated from solar and wind from 10 percent today to as close to 100 percent as possible over the next decade. The plan reframes tired talk of repairing the nation\u2019s crumbling bridges, highways and ports as a crisis in a new era of billion-dollar storms. It gets local, demanding upgrades to \u201call existing U.S. buildings\u201d to \u201cachieve maximum\u201d efficiency with energy and water use.\n\nThat holistic framing extends to the way the document describes emissions, mentioning \u201ccarbon\u201d just once and instead using the term \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d which includes methane, nitrous oxide and ozone.\n\nEnergy and infrastructure issues are the centerpiece of the resolution, with explicit goals of overhauling the transportation sector \u2015 the country\u2019s biggest source of climate pollution \u2015 to expand public transit and high-speed rail and to spur a \u201cclean\u201d manufacturing boom with a particular focus on electric vehicles.\n\nBut, unlike most existing Green New Deal concepts, food and water are focal points. The resolution proposes \u201cbuilding a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food\u201d and \u201cguaranteeing universal access to clean water.\u201d To meet those goals, the document describes \u201cworking collaboratively with farmers and ranchers\u201d to reduce agricultural pollution with \u201csustainable farming and land use practices that increase soil health\u201d and \u201csupporting family farming.\u201d\n\nUnabashedly progressive ideals anchor the resolution. A section outlining guidelines for future Green New Deal bills reads like a laundry list of populist policies, including everything from ramped-up antitrust enforcement \u2015 \u201censuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by\u201d monopolies \u2015 to a vastly expanded social safety net, \u201cproviding all people of the United States high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security, and access to clean water, air and healthy and affordable food, and nature.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution seems designed for broad appeal. The fact that Markey, a liberal stalwart who co-authored the last major climate bill Democrats tried to pass in 2009, is the lead Senate sponsor shows the insurgent Ocasio-Cortez wing is building bridges with the old guard.\n\nReuters Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) was the co-sponsor of the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill Democrats nearly passed a decade ago. Now he's spearheading the resolution effort with Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe resolution itself avoids controversial technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, instead calling for low-tech solutions, such as large-scale preservation and planting new forests to absorb carbon already in the atmosphere. In a news release, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team said carbon capture \u201ctechnology to date has not proven effective.\u201d\n\nThe resolution contains more obvious compromises. In a departure from the initial protests that gave rise to the Green New Deal, the document avoids explicitly calling for ending fossil fuel development. It leaves open the possibility of keeping existing nuclear power plants in place until after the initial 10-year mobilization plan is complete, admitting that \u201cwe are currently unsure if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant that fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution is silent on any individual technology which can move us toward a solution on this problem,\u201d Markey said at the press conference. \u201cThis is a resolution that does not have individual prescriptions in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are open to whatever works,\u201d he added later.\n\nBucking the prevailing bipartisan orthodoxy on climate policy, the resolution makes no mention of pricing carbon. The release stated that the \u201cdoor is not closed for market-based incentives or a diverse array of policy levers to play a role in the Green New Deal, but it would be a small role.\u201d\n\nTo supporters, those candid admissions showed that the document represented a feasible first step toward legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is how green socialists will govern,\u201d said Greg Carlock, the researcher at the think tank Data for Progress, whose Green New Deal blueprint from September resembles the resolution. \u201cIt will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe resolution dropped with poignant timing. During his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump ignored climate change and touted a fossil fuel agenda projected to put the world on course for cataclysmic warming, analysis by researchers at more than a dozen environmental groups projects found. On Wednesday, House Democrats kicked off two hearings on climate change less than two hours before NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2018 the fourth-hottest year ever recorded.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the resolution\u2019s prospects of passing. The GOP controls the Senate, and Republican opposition to the Green New Deal started to crystallize at Wednesday\u2019s hearings.\n\nEven among Democrats, who control the House, support is far from guaranteed. By Thursday morning, the resolution garnered more than 60 House Democrats and at least nine Senate Democrats signed onto the resolution. But in a Politico interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is.\u201d Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace issued statements that tempered their support by calling for explicit fossil fuel phase-outs.\n\nThe sort of Green New Deal the resolution describes poses an existential threat to entrenched, deep-pocketed industries that donate to Democrats. Building a constituency powerful enough to challenge fossil fuel producers, automakers and utilities requires support from the labor movement.\n\nYet the influential building-trade unions are skeptical of any policy that impedes fossil fuel infrastructure, a reliable source of lucrative contract jobs. The resolution aims to ease those worries, \u201censuring that Green New Deal mobilization creates high-quality union jobs that pay prevailing wages, hire local workers, offer training and advancement opportunities and guarantee wage and benefit parity for workers affected by the transition.\u201d\n\nBut that rhetoric isn\u2019t new, and it does little to assuage festering concerns. Renewable energy jobs tend to pay less and use fewer unionized workers than pipeline or coal-train gigs. The problem, too, is the steady erosion of labor laws over the past few decades, diminishing hopes that clean-energy work could easily reach wage parity with fossil fuels under existing statutes. A Green New Deal, in that sense, necessitates changes to labor law almost as dramatic as those governing energy and infrastructure. To that end, the resolution directly calls for \u201cstrengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe potential opposition from building trades hasn\u2019t made the Green New Deal any less popular with Democrats\u2019 swelling pool of 2020 contenders. Nearly every declared and likely candidate \u2015 former Vice President Joe Biden is a notable exception \u2015 has offered an endorsement of the Green New Deal in some form or another.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who threw his support behind the Green New Deal resolution last week, is one potential candidate. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) backed the Green New Deal in December, tying support for its climate goals to a jobs guarantee bill he already introduced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) last month sent a letter to the Republican in charge of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee outlining her support for a Green New Deal. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a likely frontrunner when he declares his candidacy, is considering legislation of his own on a Green New Deal.\n\nOthers are vague. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro all said they support the \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cconcept\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nThe resolution may draw clearer battle lines.\n\n\u201cI expect that we\u2019re going to see a lot of people saying they approve of the spirit, they love the bill, they just question whether it could pass as legislation,\u201d said R.L. Miller, president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a starting point.\u201d\n\nThis is how green socialists will govern. It will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious. Greg Carlock, Data for Progress\n\nThe Green New Deal, originally coined in the mid-2000s as a term connoting a way to bridge the environmental and economic goals, re-emerged last year as Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing Democrats ran on unabashedly progressive visions of curbing climate-changing emissions and eradicating poverty in the same stroke. In November, activists from the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats staged sit-in protests in Democratic leaders\u2019 offices, demanding they make a Green New Deal a policy priority in the newly flipped House.\n\nOcasio-Cortez joined the protests, and soon after unveiled a resolution calling for a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House. Pelosi rejected the plan even as roughly 40 Democrats agreed to support the resolution. Instead, she revived a decade-old select committee on climate change, and put a backbench moderate Democrat in charge of the panel.\n\nBut the demonstrations thrust the Green New Deal into the national spotlight. It proved popular. In December, 81 percent of registered voters said they supported a plan to generate 100 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity from clean sources within the next 10 years, upgrade the U.S. power grid, invest in energy efficiency and renewable technology, and provide training for jobs in the new, green economy, according to a poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University. That included 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans, with an eyebrow-raising 57 percent of conservative Republicans in agreement.\n\nAnother poll published last week found voters narrowly supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThe left is putting its heads together on how we can actually govern, how we can go from an opposition force, a resistance force, to one that can do things of the many, rather than the 1 percent,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst at 350.org. Speaking of the resolution, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in this.\u201d\n\nStephen O\u2019Hanlon, a Sunrise Movement spokesman, downplayed the disparities between the resolution and some of the initial demands his fellow activists made \u2015 namely the lack of an explicit fossil fuel phase-out or a hard 2030 deadline for 100 percent renewables.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bill, which means there\u2019s a lot of details to be worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still feel very good about the pieces that are still being figured out.\u201d\n\nThe resolution includes justice provisions that would be difficult to criticize. It echoes the 2015 Dakota Access pipeline protests that Ocasio-Cortez credits with inspiring her to run for office. In one section, it calls for \u201cobtaining free, prior and informed consent for Indigenous peoples for all decisions that impact them and their traditional territories.\u201d The document opens with a pledge to \u201cpromote justice and equity by stopping current, prevent future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez said at the press conference that her focus was on \u201cfully funding coal miners\u2019 pensions\u201d and \u201ccleaning the water in West Virginia.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution looks beyond the Green New Deal\u2019s impact at home. One provision, as HuffPost reported Tuesday, calls for the United States to \u201cpromoting the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding, and services with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nThat could spark a new debate over how central climate change should be to the progressive foreign policy vision taking shaping ahead of the 2020 election. Though China surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide over a decade ago, Americans boast far larger CO2 footprints per capita and remain the world\u2019s largest historic emitters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have a discussion about the debt we owe to the international community for our reckless treatment of the environment,\u201d said Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress. \u201cIt will be a tough discussion but it shows the way Ocasio-Cortez is changing the discussion.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-politics-chaos-wtf_us_5c5b1284e4b09293b20aac54": "It\u2019s been less than a week since it was discovered that the medical school yearbook page of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) featured a photo with a person dressed in blackface standing next to another person in a Ku Klux Klan robe.\n\nSomehow, things have only gotten worse.\n\nNortham, barely one year into his four-year term, is trying to retain his post amid a barrage of calls that he step down \u2015 a clamor that includes virtually every other major Democrat in the state. Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax would replace Northam \u2015 but he would do so under the cloud of a sexual misconduct allegation that just became public. If Fairfax is forced from office, still another Democrat \u2015 Attorney General Mark Herring \u2015 is next in line for the top job. But in Virginia\u2019s latest \u201ccan you believe this\u201d moment, Herring on Wednesday fessed up to his own youthful incident of racism.\n\nAll this in a state where Democrats had been riding a strong wave of political momentum.\n\nThe wildfire of political chaos began when the racist image surfaced on Northam\u2019s 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook page, which also features images of the medical school graduate and his name artfully written in calligraphy at the top.\n\nEastern Virginia Medical School A 1984 yearbook page for Gov. Ralph Northam shows two men in racist garb, though it remains unclear which, if either, is Northam.\n\nBacklash to the image was swift, with top Democratic leaders both inside the state and out calling for Northam\u2019s resignation. The disgraced governor immediately issued an apology, saying he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now.\u201d\n\nBut then, Northam changed his story the following day, suddenly adamant that he was not in the photo. In a weekend press conference, Northam argued he would have had a clear memory of being in blackface or a KKK robe, because he did have a clear memory of a time he did wear blackface.\n\n\u201cThat same year [as the yearbook\u2019s release] I did participate in a dance contest... in which I darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume,\u201d Northam told reporters. Providing elaboration when none were necessarily needed, he added that he won the contest by imitating the late pop singer\u2019s signature move \u2015 the moonwalk.\n\nA reporter asked if the governor could still moonwalk. Northam appeared to mull the idea over before his wife, standing by his side, chided him for considering even considering it under \u201cinappropriate circumstances\u201d \u2015 during a press conference about him being in blackface.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that a source close to Northam said the governor intended to hire a private investigator to examine the blackface/KKK photo. Nine of his former medical school classmates expressed support for Northam, issuing a statement that said they believe he is not in the photo.\n\nAs the furor built around Northam, attention quickly focused on Fairfax \u2015 who is black and has been viewed as a rising political star. But just two days after Northam\u2019s bizarre press conference, Fairfax faced his own troubles after an allegation of sexual assault against him surfaced. A woman claimed Fairfax assaulted her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\nIn a statement, Fairfax denied the claim. Meanwhile, NBC News reported that in a private meeting about the accusation on Monday, he said \u201cfuck that bitch,\u201d referring to the woman. Fairfax has denied using that phrase.\n\nNow comes the admission by Herring \u2015 who also seemed to have a promising political future \u2015 that he wore \u201cbrown makeup\u201d during a 1980 college party in which he wanted to look like musician Kurtis Blow. In his apology, Herring said \u201chonest conversations\u201d would ensue about whether he should continue to serve.\n\n\u201cThat I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nWhile dazed Virginians wait to see if other scandals emerge, they\u2019re at least getting a civics lesson on their state\u2019s line of gubernatorial succession.\n\nIf Northam, Fairfax and Herring all step down, Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox \u2015 a Republican \u2015 would become governor. But freak circumstances surround even Cox\u2019s position.\n\nGOP control of the state House of Delegates \u2015 and Cox\u2019s selection as speaker \u2015 occurred after a tie for a House seat in the state\u2019s November 2017 election was settled in favor of a Republican. And how did that Republican become the winner over his Democratic opponent? His name was picked out of a bowl.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grandpa-lampshade-neo-nazi-white-supremacist_us_5c5b12f9e4b00187b557717a": "A few days before alleged gunman Robert Bowers murdered 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October, he promoted a post by a well-known racist user of Gab, a social media platform that caters to white supremacists. The user had a \u201cPepe\u201d frog avatar and a distinctly offensive moniker \u2014 \u201cGrandpa Lampshade,\u201d a reference to an apocryphal story about a Nazi woman who made lampshades from the skin of Holocaust victims.\n\nOn Gab, where Bowers appears to have been radicalized, Grandpa Lampshade has published thousands of messages designed to stoke hatred of Jews. Like the one Bowers reposted:\n\nGab\n\nBut there were many posts that were worse. Many that might inspire a person to scream \u201cAll Jews must die!\u201d before shooting up a synagogue because he\u2019d bought into alt-right propaganda falsely claiming that Jews had orchestrated a migrant caravan heading toward the United States. Messages like this:\n\nGab\n\nAnd this:\n\nGab\n\nBut Grandpa Lampshade\u2019s efforts to spread hate weren\u2019t limited to Gab and didn\u2019t stop at anti-Semitism. During his weekly \u201cThoughts of the Day\u201d podcast on Radio Aryan, which he said reached thousands of listeners, he ranted about the hordes of black and brown invaders he claimed were displacing white people.\n\nHe often made it sound like violence was the only appropriate response.\n\nOn one podcast a few weeks before the Pittsburgh shooting, Grandpa Lampshade said that whites are \u201cnot gonna outbreed all of these blacks and browns\u201d and that the \u201canswer\u201d might \u201cinvolve a whole lotta killin\u2019.\u201d After the Oct. 27, 2018, massacre, he suggested that murdering 11 random Jews in a synagogue might not be the best approach, because of the scrutiny it attracted to the white supremacist movement and its chosen propaganda platforms. Better, he said, for the killin\u2019 to focus on strategic targets.\n\nThere was a twang to his voice and some grizzle in his chosen handle \u2014 they were clues to his identity. Grandpa Lampshade fretted about being exposed, but he\u2019d been sloppy in covering his tracks. He used the name \u201coilylizzard\u201d in one email address to collect donations and in another email linked to his real name. His wife advertised his now-defunct Grandpa Lampshade Twitter account in memes she\u2019d posted years ago.\n\nAnd people were looking for him. His rapid rise to prominence in the white nationalist community had brought him to the attention of anti-fascist activists. Watchdog groups and journalists were looking for him, too. Grandpa Lampshade had gone big-time. The podcast had played on the Daily Stormer, the internet\u2019s main hub for neo-Nazi content, from where he solicited bitcoin donations. (He has raised and spent almost $7,000 in bitcoin, according to information security researcher John Bambenek, who tracks neo-Nazi bitcoin transactions.)\n\nGrandpa Lampshade also forged connections with prominent white supremacists such as Andrew Anglin, Christopher \u201cThe Crying Nazi\u201d Cantwell, Robert \u201cAzzmador\u201d Ray and David Duke \u2014 just a few of the extremists who helped organize or participated in the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade was, undoubtedly, a problem. In a bygone era, he might have donned a hood and burned a cross in a remote field. But he likely would have been little more than a local malignancy. In the social media age, however, he could reach through his keyboard and contact the world. The neo-Nazi next door could be your neighbor. Your own kid could be listening to Grandpa Lampshade. And the anonymity of the internet allowed him to operate without hindrance or consequence.\n\nUntil now.\n\nBehind the Pepe mask and the Nazi pseudonym is a very average 51-year-old who represents how commonplace racism is in America. He lives about an hour outside Fort Worth, Texas, in a small town called Granbury. He works at an auto parts store. He likes motorcycles. He used to chew Red Man tobacco. He got married. He had a son. He got divorced. He remarried in blue jeans. He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nMeet Daniel Kenneth Jeffreys:\n\nInstagram\n\nJeffreys is an unremarkable man who has attained a position of influence thanks simply to an internet connection and an appetite for hate. He is the aggrieved white Everyman, a middle-aged schlub exalted and radicalized through social media at a time when the president has seemingly given every racist in America the feels.\n\nHe once worked as a youth activities supervisor at the now-shuttered Texas Youth Commission, the state\u2019s notorious juvenile corrections agency. (In 2007, long after Jeffreys had left his job, local media revealed that hundreds of troubled kids had been abused by agency employees. There is no evidence that Jeffreys was involved in the abuse.)\n\nHis journey to extremism does have an atypical arc. Unlike most of his alt-right fellow travelers, Jeffreys doesn\u2019t appear to have fully radicalized until later in life, when he was exposed to online propaganda created by millennial neo-Nazis. (Bowers, another Gen-Xer, also appears to have been radicalized later in life.)\n\nWe are not publishing Jeffreys\u2019 address or contact information \u2014 we are not \u201cdoxing\u201d him. We are exposing him. Left untreated, the racism he represents festers and metastasizes. And he is not a passive racist. He is a preacher of hate with a national reach \u2014 and as an undercover propagandist, he was a hidden threat within his own community.\n\nFrom Yahoo Comments To The Daily Stormer\n\nJeffreys has been fascinated with Nazi Germany since he was a kid, he told listeners of his podcast in March 2016. He liked seeing people who looked like him \u201caccomplishing these great things,\u201d he said. Jeffreys grew up mirroring the conservative politics of his parents, who supported Ronald Reagan. He eventually ditched the Republican Party out of loyalty to Pat Buchanan, a Holocaust-denying commentator \u2014 and a source of inspiration for members of the alt-right \u2014 who twice failed to secure the GOP presidential nomination. Jeffreys then dabbled in the conspiratorial libertarianism of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, another mainstream politician who has served as a conduit to white nationalism.\n\nIn 1991, when Jeffreys was 24, he started working at the Texas Youth Commission. He would mention the job years later in an episode of his show with Anglin as part of his argument that \u201cAmerican blacks are really like spoiled children.\u201d Jeffreys falsely claimed on the show that \u201ca huge majority\u201d of the \u201cinmate population were blacks.\u201d Jeffreys resigned voluntarily in 1996, according to Brian Sweany, a spokesman at the agency that replaced the Youth Commission.\n\nBy then, Jeffreys had married his first wife. Years later, that marriage ended in divorce. In 2003, Jeffreys got a job at an auto parts store, according to bankruptcy filings. The following year, he remarried. His wedding photos, which his mother-in-law posted to Facebook, show Jeffreys in jeans, with a handlebar mustache.\n\nFacebook\n\nJeffreys\u2019 new wife shared his enthusiasm for automobiles as well as his racist tendencies. She posted offensive content on Twitter under an account named Gothmamba, which public records indicate is registered to her.\n\nTwitter\n\nMoney was in short supply for the couple. They filed for bankruptcy the year after they married. Dan Jeffreys listed a shotgun, a pistol and two rifles as assets. He was nearly $130,000 in debt and earned about $2,100 a month, according to bankruptcy records.\n\nJeffreys eventually worked his way up to manager at another auto parts store in a nearby town. It was, as he\u2019d later say on a Grandpa Lampshade podcast, a \u201cnormie\u201d job where he interacted every day with different people, including \u201cMexicans\u201d and \u201cniggers.\u201d His wife opened an auto body paint shop specializing in \u201cCustom painting, Flames Etc.\u201d She posted hundreds of pictures of her bright orange muscle car on Instagram. Her business\u2019s Twitter account follows Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.\n\nJeffreys might have carried on in this vein forever, the down-home racist slinging crankshafts and crackpot ideas, a bigot indistinguishable from any other in the area. But one day while clicking through the comments on a Yahoo news story, he spotted another reader\u2019s recommendation to check out a website called the Daily Stormer. So he did.\n\nThe troll-y online gathering place for today\u2019s millennial neo-Nazi movement, the Daily Stormer has featured numerous posts calling for the genocide of Jews. A few years ago, it surpassed Stormfront \u2014 an older white nationalist message board that Jeffreys has said didn\u2019t \u201cgrab\u201d him \u2014 as the leading hate site on the internet. The Daily Stormer\u2019s founder and editor, Andrew Anglin, has perfected a humorous meme-laden style of blogging that makes the lies and hate he pushes appealing to a younger audience already steeped in internet culture. But the Daily Stormer, which has also celebrated violence against minorities, journalists and women, appeals to older racists, too. Jeffreys, a middle-aged, working-class Texan, thought the site was funny and kept coming back.\n\nEventually, his Daily Stormer-inspired self-indoctrination led him to \u201cThe Greatest Story Never Told,\u201d a six-hour-long revisionist film from 2013 about Adolf Hitler. Jeffreys was \u201cblown away\u201d by the film.\n\n\u201cThe light then completely shone on me,\u201d he said.\n\nJeffreys went on to read Mein Kampf and started hanging out in Daily Stormer chat rooms, where Anglin\u2019s readers plan real-world gatherings and in-person activism through his \u201cDaily Stormer Book Club\u201d network \u2014 from attending far-right rallies to posting neo-Nazi flyers in cities around the country. On the Daily Stormer, Jeffreys befriended \u201cSven Longshanks\u201d aka Steve Stone. Stone is a British Hitler fanatic and host at Radio Aryan, a white nationalist online radio network that is based in the United Kingdom and broadcasts from a secret location. British government regulators have been unable to police the neo-Nazi network because it transmits over the internet. Jeffreys pressed Stone to let him record his own show on the network; eventually, Stone agreed.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade\u2019s \u201cThoughts of the Day\u201d podcast debuted in February 2016. Jeffreys launched his Semitic Truth Center blog shortly afterward. Within months, he had become an influential neo-Nazi propagandist.\n\nGrandpa Lampshade Finds His Fans\n\nSome of the best-known members of the white supremacist community were soon talking with Jeffreys. He recorded shows with Duke, the former KKK grand wizard; Robert \u201cAzzmador\u201d Ray, an Anglin associate and longtime racist from east Texas who yelled, \u201cDeath to the enemies of the white race!\u201d hours after the Charlottesville rally; Gabriel Sohier Chaput, a Canadian neo-Nazi recruiter who goes by \u201cZeiger\u201d; Chris Cantwell, who cried over an arrest warrant and then pleaded guilty to assaulting counterprotesters at Charlottesville \u2014 and even Anglin himself.\n\n\u201cYours is one of my favorite podcasts. I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the top three,\u201d Anglin told Jeffreys in June 2016 when he appeared as a guest on Jeffreys\u2019 show.\n\nJeffreys\u2019 message is virtually indistinguishable from the conspiratorial ravings of his colleagues: White people, he claims, are the victims of a world order controlled by the Jews, who are actively replacing white Americans with black and brown invaders. This is the central and most hackneyed of white supremacist conspiracy theories, one that gives aggrieved race warriors an eternal enemy to rail against and blame for their own shortcomings. Jeffreys faults Jewish people for everything from Communism to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being served now with a cake that\u2019s been poisoned. Cake with ingredients such as feminism, this racial demographic, multicultural time bomb,\u201d Jeffreys said on his show last October. \u201cAll of these ingredients have been baked into this cake. And the baker is a hook-nosed rat Jew.\u201d\n\nWhat sets Jeffreys apart from his fellow neo-Nazi podcasters is his oddly pleasant demeanor. Unlike the jabbering Cantwell, who has the on-air presence of Archie Bunker on meth, Jeffreys delivers his sales pitch with a sing-song Southern drawl that belies the inherent violence of his worldview. He prefaces Holocaust-denying rants with a perfunctory \u201cMy gosh!\u201d\n\nUnlike most of his alt-right colleagues, Jeffreys also brings an authentic working-class Christian flavor to his racism. He has a recurring segment on his podcast that he calls \u201cThe Church of the Lampshade,\u201d in which he preaches about the devil being the father of Jews. He is the traditionalist so many white nationalists aspire and fail to be, a family man who likes to talk about how he lovingly imparts his racist views to his son \u2014 just like Jeffreys\u2019 father once did with him.\n\n\u201cI mean, the best thing I can say is, you know, just make \u2019em as Jew-wise as you can. Best safety advice you can give \u2019em boils down to \u2018when around blacks, never relax,\u2019\u201d Jeffreys once said of his conversations with his son. \u201cMy dad has said, you know, he doesn\u2019t believe blacks are a separate race, he believes they\u2019re a separate species \u2014 and the older I get, the more I realize that, you know, he was closer to the truth than any college professor,\u201d he continued.\n\nThroughout these last few years of hate-mongering screeds, Jeffreys has made a deliberate effort to stop just shy of instructing his fans to commit violence against enemies of the white race. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s a \u201cpeace-loving hipp[y],\u201d he said \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t want to get kicked offline and end up in prison for endorsing bloodshed too explicitly.\n\n\u201cJust look at the amount of effort our enemies go through to try and choke out the Daily Stormer through limiting fundraising ability,\u201d he said in January 2017. \u201cWhat do you think would happen if we gave them the opportunity to declare us all as being a part of some sort of terrorist organization or something? At the very least, we would not have our platforms anymore \u2015 and at the worst, we would all be bunking up in a federal prison somewhere.\u201d\n\nBut some Grandpa Lampshade fans don\u2019t think like that. The Pittsburgh shooter, at least, was willing to act on the violent ideology Jeffreys promoted.\n\nGab\n\nJeffreys didn\u2019t feel bad for the 11 people killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue, he said on his show a week after the attack. But he was upset about the backlash. Internet service providers abandoned Gab, forcing it to go offline temporarily. Wordpress took down Jeffreys\u2019 blog after a commenter posted a \u201cbattle plan\u201d on the site: \u201cShooting of Jews every week \u2015 until normies start to wonder why people hate Jews so much and start doing their research.\u201d\n\nWordpress Archive\n\nJeffreys implored his listeners to be more strategic in choosing which Jews to murder. He knew some of his listeners were \u201chalf a step away from being the next Bowers,\u201d he said, but he wanted them to make sure their attack would be worth it.\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re gonna get the death penalty and your grievance is that the Jews are doing all of these things and you\u2019re willing to take action that is going to result in the death penalty \u2026 if you\u2019re gonna do this, why are you gonna go kill some random Jews when you have these high-profile Jews?\u201d he asked.\n\nThis is hardly a disavowal of the violence that is foundational to white nationalism. It is, rather, a horrific suggestion from Jeffreys that targeted killings might be a more effective way to spark the white ethnostate Nazis dream of. A far safer way to feed the white nationalist movement, as Jeffreys knows, is to maintain a footprint on the platforms that give him and other neo-Nazis such far-flung reach. Platforms like Gab or Radio Aryan or the Daily Stormer. Or Twitter. Platforms that can turn a racist nobody hawking auto parts into a somebody selling hate around the world.\n\nLast week, HuffPost called the auto parts store where Jeffreys works and asked to speak with him. Whoever answered the phone hung up quickly. Hours later, Grandpa Lampshade announced that he was quitting his Radio Aryan show. He told his listeners that he wanted to spend more time with his family \u201cliving the 14 words.\u201d\n\nBut it was clear that Jeffreys knew people were onto him. He was on guard.\n\nUnder The Mask, The Everyman Racist\n\nGranbury is an ordinary town of about 8,000 people southwest of Fort Worth. Cows and llamas graze in nearby pastures. The downtown is centered around a courthouse, surrounded by a few restaurants. Fox News plays in the lobby of the Holiday Inn. Though Granbury was named for a Confederate general, it was hard to imagine a neo-Nazi cranking out propaganda for a national audience from this bland little burg.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jeffreys was at his job at the auto parts store several miles up the highway, his wife\u2019s bright orange muscle car parked outside. When HuffPost reporters approached him to confirm his identity and ask about his racist alter ego, he agreed to talk outside on the store\u2019s front steps. He was visibly nervous.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s doxing me?\u201d he asked, holding a paint can and using the far-right\u2019s preferred term for any journalism that exposes extremists.\n\nHe was worried about anti-fascist activists in the area and claimed he had received death threats. He didn\u2019t want to lose his job. He said he\u2019d ended his show and wanted to be left alone to take care of his family. He claimed that he\u2019d never called for violence on the podcast \u2014 but he had, several times.\n\n\u201cI mean we may have some killin\u2019 involved, but maybe not a whole lotta killin\u2019,\u201d he said on his podcast in October, weeks before the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.\n\nWhen asked about the podcast episode after that massacre, the one where he questioned the purpose of killing \u201crandom Jews\u201d instead of \u201chigh-profile Jews,\u201d Jeffreys said that people bent on violence can\u2019t be swayed with appeals to morality. Better, he said, to talk strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not responsible for crazy people doing crazy shit,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter speaking with HuffPost, Jeffreys took old episodes of his show offline. But he is still responsible for promoting an ideology in which violence against Jewish and non-white people is not only justified but ultimately required.\n\nLike most alt-right podcasters, Grandpa Lampshade spoke with a swaggering confidence about racially transforming the country. Social media had made him important. Made him a leader. Anonymity made him unaccountable. There was no telling how many angry white men he\u2019d helped push further down the path to extremism. Grandpa Lampshade mattered. He had influence.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-mexico-governor-national-guard-trump_us_5c5bd9aae4b08710475ac035": "New Mexico Gov.

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, gave an impassioned plea for protecting voting rights on Wednesday, saying that his mother told him on her deathbed to protect the franchise.\n\nDuring a committee hearing on the For The People Act, a bill introduced by Democrats that includes numerous voting and ethics reforms, Cummings read from a 2016 court ruling that struck down a North Carolina voting law containing a wide range of restrictions. The law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found, targeted African-Americans \u201dwith almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nCummings said that ruling struck a chord with him because a year ago, on her deathbed, his 92-year-old mother told him not to let anyone block the right to vote.\n\n\u201cOn my mother\u2019s dying bed, 92 years old, former sharecropper, her last words were, \u2018Do not let them take our votes away from us,\u2019\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cShe had fought and seen people harmed, beaten, trying to vote.

This is the United States of America.\u201d\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said his mother urged him from her deathbed to protect voting rights.\n\nDemocrats have made voting rights a priority since taking control of the House last month. Including a dramatic expansion of voting rights in H.R. 1, the first piece of legislation filed this session, is meant to send a signal as to how important the issue is to the party. (Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has already dismissed the bill.) A separate House subcommittee is charged with building a record of voter suppression across the country that can be used to justify reimplementing one of the most powerful provisions of the Voting Rights Act.

Later Thursday, the Department of Justice released a statement confirming Whitaker\u2019s scheduled appearance.\n\n\u201cActing Attorney General Whitaker looks forward to voluntarily appearing at tomorrow\u2019s hearing and discussing the great work of the Department of Justice,\u201d the statement from DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nEarlier:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is trying to back out of his scheduled Friday testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after the committee voted to subpoena him if he refuses to answer questions about conversations he had with President Donald Trump and invokes executive privilege.\n\nIn a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that Whitaker would not testify unless the committee assures the Justice Department by 6 p.m. that it will not issue a subpoena for Whitaker today or tomorrow and that the committee would engage in \u201cgood faith negotiations\u201d with DOJ before issuing a subpoena.\n\nBy Thursday night, Nadler had attempted to keep Friday\u2019s hearing on schedule, writing in a letter to Whitaker that \u201cthere will be no need for the Committee to issue a subpoena\u201d if Whitaker is prepared to answer questions tomorrow. \u201cTo the extent that you believe you are unable to fully respond to any specific question, we are prepared to handle your concerns on a case-by-case basis, both during and after tomorrow\u2019s hearing,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe high-stakes exchange came after several weeks of negotiations between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee; Whitaker is set to testify voluntarily on Friday about a number of topics. House Democrats plan to press him on his conversations with Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIf Whitaker does testify, the letter said, he would say \u201cat no time did the White House ask for, or did the Acting Attorney General provide, any promises or commitments concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nA senior Justice Department official, speaking on background, told reporters Thursday afternoon that Whitaker had been \u201cworking hard\u201d this week to prepare for his testimony, but that he wasn\u2019t going to testify under threat of subpoena on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the appropriate process... to subpoena first, talk later,\u201d the senior official said. Whitaker, the official said, is \u201cready and willing to appear\u201d under the original terms.\n\nWhitaker, who headed up a conservative organization that targeted Democrats and critiqued the Mueller investigation in cable news hits before joining the Justice Department, was named acting attorney general following the forced resignation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in November. Whitaker previously served as a U.S. attorney during the Bush administration but was not serving in a Senate-confirmed Justice Department role when he was named acting attorney general, making his lengthy term as head of DOJ historically unprecedented.\n\nThe Justice Department issued this statement from Whitaker:\n\n\u201cWeeks ago, in good faith, I voluntarily agreed to appear and testify on February 8 before the House Judiciary Committee. We have devoted considerable resources and numerous hours to my preparation, and I have looked forward to discussing the important work of the great men and women of the Department of Justice. Unfortunately, the Committee now has deviated from historic practice and protocol and taken the unnecessary and premature step of authorizing a subpoena to the me, the Acting Attorney General, even though I had agreed to voluntarily appear. Such unprecedented action breaches our prior agreement and circumvents the constitutionally required accommodation process. Based upon today\u2019s action, it is apparent that the Committee\u2019s true intention is not to discuss the great work of the Department of Justice, but to create a public spectacle. Political theater is not the purpose of an oversight hearing, and I will not allow that to be the case.\n\nThe news came out around the same time as William Barr, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general was cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) on Thursday sent Trump a letter demanding an apology for politically motivated \u201cdistortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cEl Paso has never been one of the most dangerous cities in the country, and our safety and security has long been a point of pride,\u201d Escobar wrote. \u201cThese distortions about our vibrant community are harmful to our reputation and degrade our spirit.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, said that El Paso \u201cused to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2014 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities ... immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true.\n\nFor the past 20 years, numerous ratings have listed El Paso as one of the nation\u2019s safest cities, The Washington Post reported. Construction of the border barrier wasn\u2019t begun until 2008. Snopes reports that in the 30 years ending in 2015, El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate consistently fell \u201cwell below\u201d rates in similar-sized cities, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniformed Crime Reporting data.\n\nThe violent crime rate in El Paso peaked in 1993 (similar to many other U.S. cities), according to local and federal statistics analyzed by the El Paso Times. It fell by 34 percent from then to 2006. From two years before the wall was built to two years after, violent crime actually rose 17 percent, before returning to a downward trend.\n\nTrump has been repeating the false claim since GOP Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton reportedly made a similar false statement to the president last month. Paxton has not produced data to support the comment.\n\nFormer Democratic Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose hometown is El Paso, complained to The Washington Post that Trump is \u201cjust full on, in the most racist terms, completely divorced from ... reality\u201d concerning El Paso crime, and \u201cuses this to incite fear and paranoia.\u201d\n\nRepublican Jon Barela, chief executive of the Borderplex Alliance \u2014 a nonprofit economic development organization in the region \u2014 lashed Trump\u2019s \u201cdamaging comments\u201d that perpetuate the \u201cmyth that we are a dangerous and lawless frontier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that El Paso and most of the cities on the U.S.-Mexico border boast among the safest crime statistics in the entire country,\u201d Barela told the Post.\n\nTrump plans to travel to El Paso Monday for a rally, where he\u2019ll likely repeat the crime lie in a bid to whip up support for his promised border wall. The city\u2019s Republican mayor, Dee Margo, said he\u2019s looking forward to the president\u2019s visit, but tweeted that El Paso was \u201cNEVER one of the most dangerous cities\u201d in the nation.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-tax-law-refunds_us_5c5b4885e4b00187b557d1fb": "Most Americans got a tax cut thanks to the new Republican tax law, but it\u2019s possible that millions of households will get a surprise bill from the IRS in the coming weeks.\n\nBen Williams, a lawyer in New York City, said he earned the same amount of money last year as he had the year before, but wound up with a totally different tax situation.\n\n\u201cLast year I got a $750 refund,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd this year I owe $4,600.\u201d\n\nThere are two reasons for Williams\u2019 predicament. The 35-year-old lost his refund both because Republicans targeted wealthy (and heavily Democratic) metropolitan areas for tax hikes and also because of how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration implemented the law.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut rates for taxpayers at every income level and simplified the tax code for most filers. Part of that simplification meant getting rid of a lot of deductions, which people use to reduce the amount of their taxable earnings.\n\nOne of the most controversial changes limited the amount of state and local tax payments that could be deducted. Previously, a tax filer could reduce their federal taxable income by subtracting the income taxes they paid to their state and local governments. The law capped such deductions at $10,000. Williams said he usually pays more than three times that amount in state and local levies.\n\nWhile preparing to file his taxes through the H&R Block website this week, Williams said the blood drained from his face when he realized how much he would owe. He had anticipated getting another refund that he would put toward a vacation.\n\n\u201cI guess that my assumption was that the IRS withholding tables would have been updated to some degree or my company would have done something,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is probably no way Williams could have avoided paying higher taxes, given his circumstances. But if the government had administered the tax law more carefully, he could have been spared the February surprise. Employers are supposed to withhold federal income tax from their workers\u2019 paychecks, and the vast majority of taxpayers typically withhold more than necessary, resulting in a refund in the early part of the year. The average refund is worth nearly $3,000.\n\nBut Republicans rushed their tax cuts through Congress at the end of 2017, making huge changes to the tax code without so much as a hearing, and gave the IRS hardly any time to implement the law, which took effect less than two weeks after Trump signed it.\n\nThe IRS had to scramble to figure how it should change the way tax would be withheld from paychecks for 2018. Officials with the Treasury Department told the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, that they felt they had to work with the same basic W-4 forms that employers were already using to determine withholding amounts. A trade group for payroll providers told the GAO that substantially different forms would necessitate changes to withholding software that would have taken at least half a year.\n\nThe IRS knew from its simulations \u2015 which assumed that people would not adjust their withholding amounts \u2015 that just plugging new numbers into its old withholding tables would probably reduce the number of tax filers getting a refund from 76 percent to 73 percent, according to the July GAO report. The number that owed money would increase by a proportional amount.\n\nThat means millions more households getting a bill from the IRS. In Treasury\u2019s simulations, households that itemized deductions, such as New Yorkers with higher local taxes, were likelier to withhold less tax as a percentage of their total liability.\n\n\u201cThat is the group that ends up paying more tax under the new law,\u201d said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. \u201cIt\u2019s the people in New York who are losing such a large amount of the [state and local tax] deduction they can end up owing more tax because their taxable income goes up by so much.\u201d\n\nTax filing season opened at the end of January, and the government shutdown may have hampered the IRS\u2019 ability to process returns as quickly as in previous years. Around this time in 2018, the IRS said it had processed 30 million returns and dished out 13 million refunds. (The total for the year was 150 million returns and 111 million refunds.) Similar data is not yet available for this year.\n\nThe new law cut taxes for 80 percent of households, with the biggest benefit accruing to the wealthier ones, according to the Tax Policy Center, while roughly 5 percent saw a tax increase. The changes should have been evident in paychecks last year, though incorrect withholding may have obscured the policy until now.\n\nRepublicans knew in advance that the households negatively affected by their tax changes just so happen to be clustered in states where people tend to vote for Democrats. And according to the GAO, the Trump administration may have been more worried about people withholding too much instead of too little, even though the latter can stick people with surprise tax bills and penalties, and reduces overall compliance. Withholding too little, on the other hand, makes people\u2019s paychecks bigger immediately \u2015 and the Trump administration wanted to make sure to help the people it intended to help.\n\n\u201cTreasury officials stated that withholding more from paychecks than in past years for taxpayers whose tax liability is expected to decrease would be inconsistent with the intent of the law as they understood it,\u201d the GAO said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressives-democrats-nancy-pelosi_us_5c5cadb9e4b0e01e32aab687": "WASHINGTON \u2015 In just over a month as speaker, Nancy Pelosi has deftly navigated Democrats through the shutdown and solidified her position atop the House Democratic Caucus. But at what point does the reluctance of progressives to hit back at Pelosi\u2019s mounting slights start looking less like sophistication and more like an indication that \u201cthe resurgent left\u201d is soft?\n\nWhen The Intercept revealed this week that Pelosi\u2019s top health care staffer met with Blue Cross Blue Shield executives and criticized Medicare for All, progressives generally took a pass on attacking Pelosi.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) refused to take the bait. \u201cUntil I hear my speaker say that there\u2019s an issue, I\u2019m not \u2015 for me, it has to come from her directly,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said she hadn\u2019t read the story but wouldn\u2019t criticize Democratic leadership when asked if they had done enough at this point to advance Medicare for All.\n\nAnd even though the sponsor of the Medicare for All bill, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), said she was \u201cnot happy, obviously,\u201d she praised Pelosi\u2019s support for hearings on the legislation.\n\nWhen Pelosi dismissively called the Green New Deal \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it\u201d \u2014 \u201cnobody knows what it is,\u201d Pelosi added \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez once again avoided criticizing Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think it is a dream,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Progressives are showing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deference, even as she has lobbed slights at their causes.\n\nOther progressives have shown Pelosi similar deference, despite the obvious mocking tone she used to describe the resolution.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I haven\u2019t seen what she said. And honestly, I don\u2019t really care,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said Thursday, \u201cbecause I know Nancy Pelosi, I know her commitment to doing something big on climate, and I know her record.\u201d\n\nPelosi seems to have avoided the sort of criticism conservatives would dish out to a Republican speaker if they felt dissed because progressives generally believe Pelosi is on their side. The speaker did clean up her comments a bit about the Green New Deal during her weekly press conference Thursday, though she also managed a certain backhanded condescension in doing so, saying she welcomed the \u201centhusiasm\u201d of the Green New Deal as well as \u201cthe other proposals that are out there.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, progressives have gone out of their way to stay aligned with Pelosi. After the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis didn\u2019t get the subpoena power progressives wanted, most liberals stayed quiet about it. When Ocasio-Cortez was asked why she didn\u2019t join the committee on Thursday after Pelosi invited her to be on it, the New York lawmaker said it was because she was busy with her other committees \u2015 and she didn\u2019t mention the lack of subpoena power.\n\nProgressives have also stayed in line on a number of other potential flashpoints. When Democratic leadership decided not to censure Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) \u2015 instead offering a resolution so watered down that King himself voted for it \u2015 hardly anyone spoke up. (One of the only members who did speak out was the only member who voted against the resolution, longtime Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, who authored an actual censure resolution against King.)\n\nAt the beginning of the Congress, all but three Democrats \u2015 Ocasio-Cortez, Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) \u2015 voted for a rules package that included pay-as-you-go provisions that progressives thought were harmful to the Medicare for All cause. And Democrats have stayed in line thus far on efforts to impeach President Donald Trump or even to just acquire his tax returns.\n\nBut Pelosi owes much of her power to progressives. They never made an issue out of the California Democrat\u2019s history of taking corporate PAC donations, and Pelosi quickly locked up their support during the speaker\u2019s race, even though high-profile Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez had initially wavered on Pelosi. With the more liberal wing behind her, Pelosi was able to define her opposition as a group of white, moderate men, which in turn put pressure on those Democrats to get behind her.\n\nObviously, the ability to frame issues so shrewdly is part of Pelosi\u2019s power. But she often has such a strong hand because Democrats stick together. During the shutdown, there were hardly any Democrats demanding that Pelosi move away from her original demand that there be no money for a border wall. Again, progressives were key in making that the default Democratic position, though Pelosi also won because she was able to keep every other Democrat in line as well.\n\nBut at what point do progressives start taking Pelosi\u2019s shots personally? When do her efforts to protect vulnerable Democrats from a truly liberal agenda become a problem? And when are progressives going to demand more from their leadership than some placating hearings or a toothless select committee?\n\nWhat we all want is to get something done. And I think we want to move the ball forward. We don\u2019t just want to do press conferences. I mean, we want to achieve things. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.)\n\nFor now, progressives look interested in playing the long game, knowing that none of the bills they really want to pass will become law with Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate. Progressives seem to have taken the view that even voting on their dream legislation would do more to divide Democrats than to advance their cause.\n\nJayapal, the lead author of the Medicare for All bill, told HuffPost on Wednesday that she does have commitments to get hearings on her measure, starting with the Rules Committee under the control of longtime liberal champion Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and then moving to the Budget Committee. She hopes to eventually get hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as in Ways and Means, but she hasn\u2019t asked for a vote.\n\nYou could say the same about the Green New Deal. While Democratic lawmakers made a big show of their Green New Deal rollout on Thursday, the legislation at this point is just a nonbinding resolution with principles for future legislation. It\u2019s a plan to come up with a plan \u2015 and it may never get a vote either.\n\nBut progressives aren\u2019t complaining. They\u2019re not slamming Pelosi, and they\u2019re trying to focus on where there is consensus, like on shoring up Obamacare, lowering drug prices and building initial support for their environmental legislation.\n\nAnd while Pelosi may take an occasional shot or let them down legislatively, they\u2019re not airing their grievances publicly \u2015 at least not yet. (Asked for a comment about this story, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, offered: \u201cWe agree with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez that the caucus will not be \u2018divided by whatever narrative.\u2019\u201d)\n\nLeadership is also looking to stay on the good side of the progressives, despite the occasional slip of the tongue from Pelosi.\n\n\u201cWhat we all want is to get something done,\u201d McGovern told HuffPost on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think we want to move the ball forward.

After Bland\u2019s death, Texas and Waller County each implemented reforms intended in part to reduce jail suicides, which are highly preventable. But Evan Parker, a 34-year-old black man, died in similar circumstances to Bland anyway \u2014 raising questions about how another hanging in such a closely scrutinized facility could have happened.\n\nParker was booked into Waller County jail on Jan. 10 on charges of murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon related to a workplace attack that left Parker\u2019s supervisor dead. On Jan. 25, he attempted suicide in his cell, according to the Waller County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2014he reportedly hanged himself with a mattress cover. He died at a hospital a couple days later.\n\nSuicide is the leading cause of death in jail. A HuffPost investigation found that of the more than 810 people who lost their lives in jail in the year following Bland\u2019s death, nearly one-third died from suicide. People can quickly deteriorate after being arrested: In HuffPost\u2019s data, at least one-quarter of the suicides occurred within the first three days. But in jails\u2014which mostly hold people who have not been convicted of a crime\u2014suicides can be prevented through processes such as conducting thorough inmate screening and making sure staff monitors inmates at appropriate intervals, which save lives.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know exactly what happened in this case. As of Jan. 25, according to a statement put out by the Waller County District Attorney, there wasn\u2019t any information indicating that jail staff didn\u2019t follow procedures or guidelines; the county sheriff also said there have been \u201cno indications of wrong doing.\u201d An investigation is ongoing, with the F.B.I. and the Texas Ranger Division taking lead.\n\nWaller County jail, which is overseen by Republican Sheriff Glenn Smith, is about 50 miles outside of Houston and is on the smaller side, designed for a capacity of 110 people. In July of 2015, Bland, a 28-year-old black woman, landed in the jail under very different circumstances from Parker: A Texas state trooper pulled her over as she was driving, he claimed, for not signaling when she changed lanes. She initially refused to get out of the car, and after the trooper threatened her with a Taser, in dashcam video, she was heard saying her head was knocked into the ground. She was found hanging in her cell within 65 hours after her arrest. Bland\u2019s case drew national attention to the way police treat black Americans and also brought scrutiny to how jails are responsible for protecting inmates in their care.\n\nAfter her death, a state agency rolled out a new intake form for inmates, a Texas law was passed, the Sandra Bland Act, that includes some jail reforms that are still in the process of being implemented. Bland\u2019s family reached a settlement that stipulated changes to jail procedure in Waller County. A spokesperson for the Waller County Sheriff\u2019s Office told HuffPost \u201cmedical staff on all shifts\u201d and an \u201cimproved screening form and additional training,\u201d were some of the changes made after Bland\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cYou would hope given the scrutiny [Waller County] was under three years ago, it would shape how they go about their business now,\u201d said Cannon Lambert, an attorney who represented Bland\u2019s family in their settlement case. \u201cApparently there\u2019s a gulf between what they\u2019re doing, and what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nAcross Texas, there has been a downward trend in county jail suicides since Bland\u2019s death: In Texas FY15, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, a regulatory agency created by the state\u2019s legislature, recorded 34 jail suicides. In FY2018, there were 22, according to Brandon Wood, executive director of the agency.\n\n\u201cI think quite a bit of it can be attributed to the increased awareness and pressures placed on the system to do a better job,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Waller County has a long history of racism, and with the circumstances of Bland\u2019s case, and the violence inflicted upon black Americans nationwide, some people, including those close to her, questioned whether she really took her own life.\n\nHow Did It Happen?\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Parker\u2019s case so far: The local mental health authority said he did not qualify for suicide watch, but jail staff placed him on it at some point anyway, for what was apparently several days. The Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson declined to comment to HuffPost on the day he was taken off suicide watch, but he was not on it on the day of his suicide attempt. He was checked on \u201cperiodically\u201d and in-person, according to the spokesperson, with a check around 2:21 a.m. before he was found inside his cell near 2:57 a.m.\n\nThe spokesperson did not comment on whether Parker was in a single cell. Reports indicate he was in his cell alone.\n\n\u201cWaller County Sheriff\u2019s Office personnel do their job daily to assure safety of all people and are saddened by any death,\u201d the Sheriff\u2019s spokesperson told HuffPost in an email.\n\nThe situation raises several issues, said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who is an expert in criminal detention, such as whether jail authorities appropriately decided Parker should not be on suicide watch.\n\nWaller County jail has faced other scrutiny since Bland: As recently as Dec. 19, 2018, a Texas jail inspection report found that Waller County jail wasn\u2019t fully compliant with certain standards, which included reports that staff allegedly lagged behind in monitoring inmates. The jail had submitted a corrective plan of action to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, Wood said, adding his staff reviewed it to ensure it addressed the issues.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the community is waiting for answers. Ashton Woods, an activist who founded Black Lives Matter Houston, said he had the same reaction to Parker\u2019s death that he did with Bland\u2019s: \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t feel right about this, it\u2019s all too familiar,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a few years now to correct these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had a bad experience in the past, same sheriff, and it looks like they don\u2019t get it,\u201d said state Sen.

The barrier will be two miles from the actual border, so gates will be built to allow Texans access from one part of America to another, she said.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with a levee, nothing to do with the environment,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis is tactical. It\u2019s going to be guarded by paramilitary personnel.\u201d\n\nSome 35,000 people a year visit the butterfly center, which has as many as 200 species of butterflies in a wildlife area that will be devastated by bulldozing and disrupted by vehicle traffic, bright lights, garbage and increased human activity, Wright complained.

Construction was also slated for the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, though the refuge was ultimately spared after intense public backlash.\n\nWright told HuffPost that a border official told her the Trump administration is beginning its barrier construction in Texas through environmental sites because it\u2019s the \u201cpath of least resistance.\u201d That strategy won\u2019t immediately trigger outrage from large numbers of private property owners whose land will also be confiscated.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection could not immediately be reached for comment. The agency claims on its website, however, that\u2019s it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to environmental and cultural stewardship while performing our core missions of border security.\u201d Department of Interior officials, however, have largely ignored wildlife experts\u2019 concerns about the ecological devastation of a border wall.\n\nRep.

In the case of Mission, the barrier is going up on the American side.\n\nHurd believes border surveillance using radar and cameras, and a careful examination of what\u2019s being done and what works is a far more rational approach to take.\n\nAll nine representatives who represent border areas in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California oppose the wall, but Hurd is the only Republican.

Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who last year defied his party\u2019s leaders and derailed a federal judgeship for Thomas Farr, is resisting pressure from fellow conservatives to change his mind and reiterated his opposition to putting Farr on the bench because of concerns about the North Carolinian\u2019s record on racial issues.\n\nScott torpedoed Farr\u2019s confirmation to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina last November after a leaked memo revealed the nominee\u2019s role in a racist voter suppression scheme during the 1984 and 1990 campaigns of the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).\n\nDespite the political embarrassment of thwarted nomination, Farr\u2019s backers want President Donald Trump to again submit his name for Senate confirmation to the judgeship in the new session of Congress. And in a letter to Scott earlier this week, 31 conservative leaders urged him to reverse himself, given that his stance on Farr could prove crucial to whether Trump follows through with a renomination.\n\n\u201cIn these difficult days, when allegations of racism are carelessly, and all too often deliberately, thrown about without foundation, the result is not racial healing, but greater racial polarization,\u201d they wrote in the letter obtained by the McClatchy News Service. \u201cJoining with those who taunt every political opponent a \u2018racist\u2019 as a partisan political tactic to destroy their reputations is not helpful to the cause of reconciliation.\u201d\n\nThose signing the letter include Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife, Ginni Thomas, former Attorney General Edwin Meese, who served under President Ronald Reagan, and an array of North Carolina GOP leaders.\n\nScott met with Farr on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, but did not change his mind, McClatchy reported. And he offered a fiery response to the news outlet to the letter from the conservatives. From the story:\n\n\u201cWhy they have chosen to expend so much energy on this particular nomination I do not know, but what I do know is they have not spent anywhere near as much time on true racial reconciliation efforts, decrying comments by those like (Republican U.S. Rep.) Steve King, or working to move our party together towards a stronger, more unified future,\u201d Scott continued, referring to the Iowa congressman who recently suggested he was sympathetic to white supremacists in a New York Times interview.\n\nScott, noting that he supports Republican judicial nominees the vast majority of the time, also said that \u201cfor some reason the authors of this letter choose to ignore ... facts.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-stacey-abrams-state-of-the-union_us_5c533da2e4b01d3c1f1182c0": "TRUMP on Stacey Abrams: \"I campaigned against Stacy Abrams.

I don\u2019t like to take things off the table.\u201d\n\nAfter a 35-day partial shutdown \u2015 the longest such closure in U.S. history \u2015 Trump agreed on Jan. 25 to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated border security. He has threatened to shut down the government again or declare a national emergency to secure funds for his border wall if the talks fail. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have slammed Trump\u2019s threat to declare a national emergency to achieve his wall.\n\n\u201cYou know there have been plenty of national emergencies called,\u201d Trump told CBS. \u201cAnd this really is an invasion of our country by human traffickers. ... The only way you have a strong border is you need a physical barrier. You need a wall. And anybody that says you don\u2019t, they\u2019re just playing games.\u201d\n\nPelosi is \u2018very bad for our country\u2019\n\nTrump bashed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over her refusal to cave to his demand for border wall money, despite his repeated vows that Mexico would pay to build it.\n\nAsked what he learned about negotiating with her, Trump told CBS that she was \u201cvery rigid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she is very bad for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows that you need a barrier. She knows that we need border security. She wanted to win a political point.\u201d\n\nBrennan reminded Trump that Pelosi had offered $1 billion toward border security. He responded, without citing evidence, that Pelosi\u2019s stance on the wall was costing the country billions of dollars and blamed \u201cpeople like\u201d her for \u201cpeople dying all over the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing a terrible disservice to our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on the 15th, we have now set the table beautifully because everybody knows what\u2019s going on because of the shutdown. People that didn\u2019t have any idea \u2015 they didn\u2019t have a clue as to what was happening. They now know exactly what\u2019s happening. \u201d\n\nDon\u2019t \u2018have to agree\u2019 with intelligence officials on global threats\n\nTrump on Wednesday undermined his intelligence officials once again, tweeting that they are \u201cextremely passive and naive\u201d and suggesting they \u201cgo back to school.\u201d\n\nHis Twitter attack followed the release of intelligence agencies\u2019 annual report on worldwide security threats, which determined the so-called Islamic State had not yet been totally defeated in Syria and found no evidence that Iran was close to producing a nuclear weapon. Trump has repeatedly claimed otherwise.\n\nAsked if he agreed with the report\u2019s findings on Iran, Trump said no.\n\n\u201cI disagree with them,\u201d the president told CBS. \u201cI have intel people, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to agree. ... I want them to have their own opinion and I want them to give me their opinion. But, when I look at Iran, I look at Iran as a nation that has caused tremendous problems.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cSo when my intelligence people tell me how wonderful Iran is \u2015 if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to just go by my own counsel.\u201d\n\nWe have \u2018very fast airplanes\u2019 we can use if we see a resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East\n\nBrennan grilled Trump about concerns from national security experts and lawmakers who warn the president\u2019s decision to suddenly withdraw thousands of troops from Syria and Afghanistan could have grave consequences.\n\n\u201cThe concern in here by your intelligence chiefs,\u201d she said, \u201cis that you could in that vacuum see a resurgence of ISIS, see a resurgence of terror groups like Al Qaeda \u2015\u201d\n\nTrump interrupted, \u201cAnd you know what we\u2019ll do? We\u2019ll come back if we have to. We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly, and I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a base in Iraq and the base is a fantastic edifice,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean I was there recently, and I couldn\u2019t believe the money that was spent on these massive runways.\u201d\n\nBrennan called out Trump for \u2018telegraphing your retreat\u2019 in the Middle East\n\n\u201c[You] campaigned saying that President Obama made a big mistake by telegraphing his military moves,\u201d Brennan told the president. \u201cYou\u2019re telegraphing your retreat.\u201d\n\nTrump bristled at her assertion. \u201cI\u2019m not telegraphing anything,\u201d he claimed. \u201cNo, no, no. There\u2019s a difference. ... [Obama] showed tremendous weakness. But we didn\u2019t have Syria whereas we had Iraq.\u201d\n\nOn keeping troops in Iraq: \u2018Well, we spent a fortune on building this incredible base\u2019\n\nBrennan asked Trump about his decision to keep American troops in Iraq, despite his saying going into Iraq was \u201cone of the greatest mistakes\u201d the U.S. has made.\n\n\u201cWell, we spent a fortune on building this incredible base,\u201d the president responded. \u201cWe might as well keep it. And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem.\u201d\n\nBrennan, apparently taken aback by Trump\u2019s response, responded, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s news. You\u2019re keeping troops in Iraq because you want to be able to strike in Iran?\u201d\n\nTrump replied that he simply wants \u201cto be able to watch Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep watching and we\u2019re going to keep seeing and if there\u2019s trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we\u2019re going to know it before they do,\u201d he added.\n\nOn whether the Taliban can be trusted: \u2018They\u2019re tired\u2019\n\nAfter acknowledging negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban, Trump was asked whether the militant political group in Afghanistan could be trusted.\n\n\u201cLook, whether we should have been there in the first place, that\u2019s first question,\u201d Trump responded, referring to America\u2019s nearly 19-year presence in Afghanistan. \u201cSecond question\u2015\u201d\n\nBrennan interrupted, \u201cThat\u2019s where 9/11 was launched from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there for 19 years, almost,\u201d the president continued. \u201cWe are fighting very well. We\u2019re fighting harder than ever before. And I think that they will \u2015 I think they\u2019re tired and, I think everybody\u2019s tired. We got to get out of these endless wars and bring our folks back home. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to be watching with intelligence.\u201d\n\nTrump bashed President George W. Bush\u2019s intelligence officials. But said he trusts Bolton... a hawkish former Bush official.\n\nWhile defending his decision to publicly disagree with the intelligence community, Trump tore into President George W. Bush\u2019s intelligence community.\n\n\u201cPresident Bush had intel people that said Saddam Hussein in Iraq had nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said. \u201cGuess what? Those intel people didn\u2019t know what the hell they were doing, and they got us tied up in a war that we should have never been in.\u201d\n\nExperts say the U.S. invaded Iraq for several reasons, including cherry-picked intelligence findings promoted by Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney as well as neoconservatives who had long pushed for Hussein to be overthrown.\n\nBrennan pointed out that National Security Adviser John Bolton, whom Trump named to the role in March 2018, worked in the Bush administration. Bolton served as the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs from 2001 to 2005 and had been an early supporter of the invasion of Iraq. Historians have dubbed him an architect of the Iraq War.\n\nBut Trump said he trusts Bolton nonetheless.\n\n\u201cI respect John and John is not one of the people that happened to be testifying,\u201d he said, referring to some intelligence officials who testified about national security in front of a Senate panel Tuesday.\n\nHaving so many \u2018acting\u2019 Cabinet members \u2018gives me more flexibility\u2019\n\nBrennan questioned Trump over the several members of his Cabinet who hold \u201cacting\u201d rather than permanent positions such as acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to make moves when they\u2019re acting,\u201d Trump said, hinting that more shake-ups within his administration could be on the horizon. Under the Trump presidency, top government positions have seen an unprecedented rate of turnover.\n\n\u201cI like acting because I can move so quickly,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt gives me more flexibility.\u201d\n\nTrump said he fires people \u201cwhen it doesn\u2019t get done,\u201d adding that he had ordered Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to resign.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with his service,\u201d Trump told CBS. \u201cI told him give me a letter.\u201d\n\nMattis submitted his letter of resignation a day after Trump announced the sudden withdrawal of troops from Syria, a move widely criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Mattis, who disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision, wrote in his resignation letter that the president \u201chas a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\u201d\n\n\u2018I took care of\u2019 criminal justice reform NFL players protested for\n\nTrump claimed a boost in NFL ratings this season could be attributed to NFL players kneeling less during the national anthem in protest of police brutality.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been kneeling and they have been respecting the flag and their ratings have been terrific ever since,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of good things happened.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cA lot of it is having to do with reform from what I understand. Whether it\u2019s criminal justice or whatever it may be and they have different versions and everybody seemed to have a different version of it. But a lot of it had to do with that, and I took care of that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments referred to his signing into law in December a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. The so-called First Step Act was the first major overhaul of prison sentencing laws in decades. Critics of the legislation say the reform doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u2018Something very special\u2019 is happening with race relations in the U.S.\n\nTrump credited himself for job growth among African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. And though he is beloved by white supremacists, the president said he is to thank for what he claimed are improving race relations.\n\n\u201cIn terms of race, a lot of people are saying, well, this is something very special what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you look at the numbers for African-American unemployment, best numbers they\u2019ve had \u2015 literally the best numbers they\u2019ve had in history. And I think they like me a lot and I like them a lot.\u201d\n\nOn son Barron potentially playing football: \u2018I would have a hard time with it\u2019\n\nTrump said he wouldn\u2019t say no if his youngest son, Barron, wanted to play football, but he wouldn\u2019t \u201csteer him that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football \u2015 I mean, it\u2019s a dangerous sport,\u201d he said, likely referring to studies that show a strong connection between playing the sport and serious brain injuries.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it because I love to watch football,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son \u2015 well, I\u2019ve heard NFL players saying they wouldn\u2019t let their sons play football. So ... I would have a hard time with it.\u201d\n\nTrump in November 2015 said he worried the NFL was getting too soft.\n\n\u201cI hope they don\u2019t soften the game up too much,\u201d Trump had said at the time. \u201cDon\u2019t make it too politically correct. What we\u2019re doing in the country is that everything has to be [politically correct]. It\u2019s a violent game.\u201d\n\nRefused to say whether Mueller report should be public\n\nTrump, per usual, continued to attack special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nAsked if he would make Mueller\u2019s report public once it\u2019s finished, Trump passed the buck.\n\n\u201cTotally up to the attorney general,\u201d he told Brennan. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends. I have no idea what it\u2019s going to say.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo far this thing\u2019s been a total witch hunt. And it doesn\u2019t implicate me in any way. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing.\u201d\n\nU.S. military intervention in Venezuela \u2018an option\u2019\n\nAsked what national security interest the U.S. would have in sending troops to Venezuela, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to say.\n\n\u201cCertainly it\u2019s something that\u2019s on the \u2015 it\u2019s an option,\u201d he said. He added that he turned down a meeting request from Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has refused to step down despite the country\u2019s National Assembly calling his election illegitimate.\n\n\u201cThat was the wealthiest country of all in that part of the world, which is a very important part of the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd now you look at the poverty and you look at the anguish and you look at the crime and you look at all of the things happening. So, I think the process is playing out \u2015 very, very big, tremendous protests.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-walker-tax-tweet-twitter-slam_us_5c534ccee4b0bdf0e7d946a8": "Recently ousted Wisconsin governor Scott Walker attempted to school Elizabeth Warren on tax policy on Thursday.\n\nHowever, his bizarre analogy just reminded Twitter users that he championed $4 billion in tax breaks to a corporation that is now reconsidering its plans to build a manufacturing facility in the state.\n\nLast week, Warren proposed imposing a 2 percent \u201cultra-millionaire tax\u201d on 75,000 of the wealthiest American households that some economists project could generate about $2.75 trillion over 10 years.\n\nWalker apparently found problems with the proposal even though Warren is a former college professor who specialized in bankruptcy law, while Walker dropped out of college needing 34 units to graduate.\n\nSo Walker took to Twitter to gripe about Warren\u2019s proposal using, if we\u2019re going to be honest, more emojis than a former governor probably should ever use in a tweet.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s Wealth Tax is like telling a straight \ud83c\udd70\ufe0f student in high school \ud83d\udcda that she has to give up some of her grades to the other students.

Ralph Northam (D) to resign after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page emerged Friday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats were virtually unanimous in their push for Northam to step aside, taking offense to both the photo itself \u2015 which showed one man in blackface and another in Ku Klux Klan robes \u2015 and the governor\u2019s initial acknowledgement that he was one of the men featured in it. He changed his tune at a press conference Saturday, denying that he was in the photo but admitting to wearing blackface another time. He also was widely mocked when he appeared to consider moonwalking for reporters.\n\nAfter that press conference, even the Democratic elected officials who had initially stuck by the governor began to abandon him.\n\nBut there are also high political stakes involved.\n\nDemocrats have a good chance of taking control of both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, where Republicans currently have narrow majorities, in November. Republicans now hold a three-seat majority in the state House and a two-seat advantage in the state Senate.\n\nBut Northam remaining at the top of the ticket could jeopardize Democrats\u2019 shot at unified control of state government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unimaginable scenario going into an election cycle,\u201d said an adviser to a Democratic state legislator who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cThis is the closest opportunity Democrats have had to take control of the legislature in a generation.\u201d\n\nVirginia is one of a handful of states in the country where gubernatorial and state legislative elections occur in off years when there is no congressional or presidential election to drive turnout.\n\nThe backlash to President Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016 spurred high Democratic turnout and enthusiasm in Virginia\u2019s November 2017 elections. As a result, Democrats kept control of the governorship by a comfortable margin and flipped 15 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, bringing them within a hair of taking control of the legislative chamber.\n\nGiven the current political environment, I can\u2019t see any scenario where the Republicans don\u2019t claim [Northam] is either the Klansman or the person in blackface in mail or in TV. adviser to a Democratic state legislator in Virginia, on this year's state elections\n\nEven in the minority, the new Democratic cohort produced major policy wins for the party. Building on their electoral momentum, Northam and legislative Democrats managed to pick up enough Republican support to expand Medicaid to 400,000 low-income Virginians in May using federal funding from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe party was hopeful that its legislative accomplishments, Northam\u2019s relative popularity and the seemingly unabated passion of the Democratic base could power a strong enough showing to flip both chambers. (The state Senate, which was not up for re-election in 2017, is in cycle in 2019.)\n\nUnified control of Virginia\u2019s state government could usher in a period of progressive lawmaking the likes of which the state has not experienced in decades \u2015 if at all.\n\nSome items on Democrats\u2019 agenda if they take control include raising the state\u2019s minimum wage and permanently restoring voting rights to former felons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, unified control would enable Democrats to run the redistricting process in 2021, preventing a repeat of the 2011 drawing in which Republicans heavily gerrymandered the congressional and state legislative district boundaries.\n\nBut a governor is the de facto face of a party \u2015 its chief fundraiser and advocate in the media. Candidates for state legislature frequently lack the name recognition that a highly visible figure like the governor wields.\n\nIf Northam remains in power, Democrats would not only lack the chance to deploy him as an asset in November, but also suffer from Republican willingness to turn him into a liability.\n\nNotwithstanding the Virginia GOP\u2019s willingness to traffic in explicit racial incitement \u2015 look no further than Ed Gillespie\u2019s gubernatorial bid and Corey Stewart\u2019s run for U.S. Senate \u2015 the party has pounced on the racist Northam photo.\n\nOur call for Ralph Northam's resignation stands.

Under President Barack Obama, the EPA determined the existing standards for limiting smog-forming ozone pollution fell short and needed to be toughened.\n\nLast June, the EPA proposed a rule reversing that determination, a move undercutting more aggressive enforcement of the Clean Air Act. The EPA finalized the rule last month.\n\nOn Thursday, newly elected New York Attorney General Letitia James cried foul, filing a lawsuit arguing the EPA is violating the Clean Air Act by \u201cfailing to require any further control of power plants and other sources of smog pollution in states upwind\u201d of her state.\n\nThe attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey joined the suit, as did New York City.\n\n\u201cOver two-thirds of New Yorkers regularly breathe unhealthy air due to smog pollution,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cYet, the Trump EPA is ignoring the Clean Air Act and refusing to require reductions in the pollution largely responsible for this serious public health risk \u2015 pollution that blows into New York from upwind states.\u201d\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS New York Attorney General Letitia James led five other states in suing the Trump EPA over enforcement of the Clean Air Act.\n\nAt the heart of the lawsuit is a 2015 determination during the Obama administration that found air pollution rules in 24 states failed to \u201csufficiently and collectively\u201d reduce pollution emissions and threatened states like New York, which has some of the country\u2019s strictest clean air regulations.\n\nThose states targeted in 2015 included Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia \u2015 all upwind of New York.\n\nThe suit filed Thursday in the U.S. Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit argues that the EPA\u2019s 2018 revised determination is \u201cunlawful, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d The suit asks the court to vacate the rule.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the Trump administration is relying on technically flawed and incomplete analysis to disregard its obligations under the Clean Air Act,\u201d said David Hayes, executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center, which works with state attorneys general. \u201cThis coalition of attorneys general have actively opposed this administration\u2019s repeated attempts to shirk its legal responsibility to protect the public from dangerous levels of ozone pollution, and they are standing on very firm legal ground in this case.\u201d\n\nThe suit marks James\u2019 first major environmental challenge to the White House since she took office this month. Democratic attorneys general, who now control a majority of states\u2019 top law enforcement jobs, have become a major bulwark against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to delay or roll back nearly 80 environmental regulations. Earlier on Thursday, 15 state attorneys general filed a petition with the EPA requesting new restrictions on asbestos. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has sued the White House over environmental regulations at least two dozen times.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy borrowed from their Republican counterparts.

Zeldin tagged Omar in the tweet with the anti-Semitic voicemail because he wanted to know \u201cif his pro BDS, anti Israel colleague disagreed with it,\u201d Vincentz continued.\n\nZeldin\u2019s claims about Omar\u2019s political stances are baseless. She has praised the boycott movement but also questioned whether it is an effective way to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. She opposes legislation that would criminalize the constitutionally protected act of participating in a boycott. Supporting the BDS movement is not equivalent to being anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. She has urged against a \u201cU.S. backed coup in Venezuela\u201d but has not supported Maduro. And the claim that she has pushed for leniency for ISIS fighters \u2014 a narrative spread by far-right conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl \u2014 is based on a letter she wrote to a judge in 2016 suggesting rehabilitation instead of long prison sentences for a group of radicalized young men who were convicted of trying to join ISIS but never made it to a combat zone.\n\nSince entering the political fray, Omar\u2019s opponents have looked for every opportunity to portray the foreign-born Muslim lawmaker as a threat to Jewish Americans. In just the past two weeks, the National Republican Congressional Committee sent out at least eight emails accusing her of being a bigot and an anti-Semite. Through it all, she has patiently reiterated her positions and remained receptive to good-faith criticism.\n\nLast month, for example, she recalibrated her defense of a tweet during the 2012 Gaza War, in which she wrote, \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.\u201d In response to a New York Times column about her tweet and the history of anti-Semitic portrayals of Jews as deceitful manipulators, she defended her criticism of the Israeli military but said she regretted unintentionally invoking the trope.\n\nZeldin, however, has shown no such willingness to evolve.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ralph-northam_us_5c567c92e4b09293b204c5b5": "President Donald Trump called Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam \u201cunforgivable\u201d on Saturday, responding to the controversy over a racist photo from the Democrat\u2019s medical school yearbook.\n\nAfter previously admitting to appearing in the image, which showed a man in blackface next to another clad in a Ku Klux Klan hood, Northam backpedaled during a press conference, claiming he actually wasn\u2019t in the photo.\n\nTrump called out Northam on Twitter, writing the reversal occurred \u201c24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture.\u201d He also bashed the governor over his recent remarks on a bill in the Virginia state legislature that sought to lift abortion restrictions.\n\nDemocrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, \u201cI believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.\u201d This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on \u201csuper\u201d late term abortion. Unforgivable! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2019\n\nTrump added that Northam\u2019s 2017 Republican gubernatorial challenger, Ed Gillespie, must rue that his staff didn\u2019t know of the photo so that he could have used it against the Democrat.\n\nEd Gillespie, who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam, must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election, he wins by 20 points! \u2014 Donald J.

The surprise troop announcements also alarmed Republicans on Capitol Hill, who managed to convince Trump to delay the pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria for several months to ensure a slow and orderly withdrawal.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted 68-23 to advance an amendment offered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a key Trump ally, that expressed the sense of the chamber that the U.S. \u201cfaces continuing threats from terrorist groups operating in Syria and Afghanistan\u201d and that the \u201cprecipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.\u201d\n\nWhile the amendment is a nonbinding provision without the force of law, it sent a clear message to the White House that any plans to immediately pull troops out of war zones could jeopardize the fight against groups like the so-called Islamic State, leave Kurdish allies on the ground defenseless, and embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran.\n\nWhether to withdraw from the conflicts could become a big issue in the coming Democratic presidential primary, however. Many likely or declared candidates have struggled to voice a clear position on Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves in the Middle East.\n\nThe vote to advance McConnell\u2019s amendment took place just a day after Trump called the heads of his own intelligence agencies \u201cnaive\u201d on Twitter for contradicting him about the threats North Korea and the Islamic State pose to the U.S. The tweet came after Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel testified on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Intelligence should go back to school,\u201d Trump said in the tweet on Wednesday, which is only the latest example of him ridiculing and refusing to take advice from his own top national security advisers.\n\nTrump\u2019s public broadsides against the intelligence community \u2015 which follows his denials about the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessments regarding the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 presidential election \u2015 irked GOP leadership in the Senate this week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you can say this but I prefer the president would stay off Twitter \u2014 particularly with regard to these important national security issues,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nLast year, a big bipartisan majority of senators similarly rebuked the Trump administration over its support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets criticizing intelligence officials also alarmed Democratic leadership in the House and Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence leaders this week urging them to stage an \u201cintervention\u201d with Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, said it was \u201ccourageous\u201d that intelligence officials \u201cspoke truth to power. \u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-cory-booker-articulate_us_5c548d9ce4b09293b203d6b8": "Chris Christie may have thought he was paying Sen.

Considering they are both New Jersey politicos, it was a natural topic for Christie to discuss at an event hosted by The Washington Post the same day.\n\nChristie actually thinks Booker could be a threat to Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.\n\n\u201cCory Booker: talented, smart, articulate, hope that he stays in this campaign to the roots that I saw him establish in New Jersey,\u201d Christie said. \u201cHe was someone who was pro-voucher, he was pro-charter school, he was somebody who was tough on crime in the city of Newark.
