{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-bureaucratic-coup-trump_n_5c6a69c7e4b033a79943feaa": "Sen.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-mccabe-trump-russia-putin_n_5c6a0de4e4b033a79943bd2b": "Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe \ufeffmade a series of startling allegations during a sweeping interview with \u201960 Minutes\u2019 that aired Sunday, including claims that President Donald Trump\ufeff took advice from Russian President Vladimir Putin over the counsel of his own intelligence chiefs.\n\nSpeaking with host Scott Pelley, McCabe, who was fired last March just two days before his retirement, alleged that Trump regularly launched into unprompted diatribes about his fondness for Russia.\n\nIn one instance, McCabe claimed, Trump said he didn\u2019t believe North Korea had the capability to launch a missile at the United States because Putin had told him so.

Trump rescinded those protections upon taking office but their status remains in limbo due to pending court cases.\n\n\u201cCongress has the power to address this move by the president, and we must use it. As President Obama said himself in 2013, he is not an emperor; his job is to execute laws that are passed, not write his own. Congress must hold him accountable,\u201d Jordan said in a statement in 2014.\n\nThe comparison between Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and his predecessor\u2019s executive action on immigration is not perfect; Trump is claiming authority via the National Emergencies Act of 1976, a legally dubious move in itself.

Martha McSally in 2020. He\u2019s a dream candidate: a naval aviator-turned-astronaut who\u2019s made four trips to space, the husband of a Democratic Party star who survived an assassination attempt, a gun control advocate who\u2019s helped a nationwide network of candidates and built a matching network of donors.\n\nHowever, the party\u2019s left wing is holding off on the celebrations for now. Public records show Kelly voted in the 2012 GOP primary while living in Texas, meaning he likely cast a ballot for either Mitt Romney or one of the host of conservatives running against President Barack Obama and either Ted Cruz or David Dewhurst for Senate. (A Kelly spokesperson said he voted for Obama in the general election.)\n\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images Mark Kelly, a gun control advocate, former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, will be a top Democratic contender for Arizona's Senate seat.\n\nAnd progressives both in the state and nationally have long been preparing for Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino veteran of the war in Afghanistan and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to run for the seat. Gallego is still considering a bid, potentially creating an ideological clash with Kelly. It\u2019s one of a host of potentially pugnacious primaries Democrats could face in 2020 as they seek to win back control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Gallego wrote on Twitter Tuesday, the day Kelly announced his campaign. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon. #AZSEN \u2014 Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) February 12, 2019\n\nA Democratic source said Gallego\u2019s chief of staff, David Montes, a veteran of former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid\u2019s office, has been taking meetings with media consultants and pollsters in recent weeks to prepare for a potential bid. Gallego isn\u2019t 100 percent certain to run; his team is still investigating whether it could raise the cash necessary to challenge Kelly in a primary.\n\nMcSally, a moderate-turned-Trump ally who narrowly lost the U.S. Senate race to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in November and was appointed to the seat formerly held by the late John McCain in December, is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot in 2020.\n\nA primary battle between Gallego, 39, and Kelly, 54, could be one of several such contests Senate Democrats face this cycle. While it\u2019s still early in the recruiting process \u2015 Arizona\u2019s primary won\u2019t be until August 2020 \u2015 there\u2019s also the potential for intraparty clashes to determine who will face incumbent Republicans in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. Races in those five GOP-held states, along with the Democrats\u2019 defense of seats in Alabama, Michigan and New Hampshire, are likely to determine which party controls the Senate in 2021. (Democrats are also likely to look at redder territory, including Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and Texas.)\n\nIn Colorado, a host of Democrats are likely to compete for the right to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. Two Democrats who have run for statewide office in the past \u2015 former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff and former state Sen. Mike Johnston \u2015 have already entered the race, and another former state House Speaker, Crisanta Duran, is also considering a challenge to Gardner.\n\nIn both Georgia and North Carolina, Democrats are focused on wooing candidates who could clear the field: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s pursuit of former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to run against Sen. David Perdue is no secret, and Democrats are eyeing Attorney General Josh Stein in North Carolina as a challenger to Sen. Thom Tillis. But if either candidate opts against the run, the field would be wide open. In Iowa and Maine, no consensus candidate has emerged but operatives believe women would be best to challenge Sens. Joni Ernst and Susan Collins.\n\nThe Next Mission For An Undefined Candidate\n\nKelly\u2019s strengths are readily apparent. As the leader of Giffords, the gun control group named for his wife, shooting victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), he\u2019s become a high-profile advocate on a key issue for the Democratic base and played a major role in raising and spending more than $17 million for candidates across the country last cycle.\n\nHis introductory video, however, makes little mention of his gun control work, instead focusing on the rest of his biography: The son of a woman who became one of the first female police officers in the 1970s, he joined the Navy, flew combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and become an astronaut alongside his twin brother. He then left NASA to help Giffords with her recovery.\n\nThe sterling biography, however, hides a candidate who is still ideologically undefined. In the launch video, Kelly makes his opposition to gerrymandering and refusal to take corporate PAC money clear, but how he would solve other problems mentioned in the video \u2015 high health care costs, wage stagnation \u2015 is left unsaid. As one Gallego ally, granted anonymity to speak about Kelly\u2019s weaknesses, said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know a lot about Mark.\u201d\n\nKelly does take a firm stance on his belief in man-made climate change. 314 Action, a group that backs scientists for office, cited that as a reason to quickly endorse him. \u201cVery few people have had the type of view Mark has of the damage climate change has done to our planet,\u201d said Josh Morrow, the group\u2019s executive director, referring to Kelly\u2019s time in outer space.\n\nKelly\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t make him available for an interview, but he told the Arizona Republic he sees himself as someone who\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d and is \u201cnot going to look at these issues through a partisan lens.\u201d Sinema, who is now seen as one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, used similar rhetoric during her 2018 win over McSally.\n\nAnd his vote in the 2012 GOP primary is easy fodder for a Democratic rival. Kelly\u2019s campaign said the candidate didn\u2019t remember whom he voted for in either the presidential or Senate primaries that year.\n\n\u201cMark was an independent at the time, and because President Obama was uncontested, Mark voted in the Republican primary,\u201d said Jacob Peters, Kelly\u2019s communications director. \u201cHe proudly voted for President Obama in the general.\u201d\n\nGallego\u2019s Uphill Battle\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Progressives don't have a great record in recent Senate primaries. Rep. Ruben Gallego will try to change that.\n\nFor Gallego to defeat Kelly would be a reversal of a long-standing political trend. Essentially, no progressive Democrat has triumphed in a contested Senate primary for a GOP-held seat since former Rep. Joe Sestak ousted party-switching Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010. Since then, DSCC-endorsed candidates have squashed candidates like now-Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and former Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.\n\nSchumer has worked assiduously over the years to avoid high-profile primaries in states where Democrats are looking to win GOP-held seats. The Senate Democratic leader has largely been successful, defeating a smattering of left-wing candidates. In the past two election cycles, only two Democratic primaries in targeted Senate seats \u2015 Katie McGinty\u2019s 2016 victory in Pennsylvania and Patty Judge\u2019s win in Iowa the same year \u2015 were decided by fewer than 38 percentage points. (Both women eventually lost to incumbent Republicans.)\n\nThe Harvard-educated Gallego, who supports Medicare for All, marijuana legalization and a $15 minimum wage, would be the first Latino to represent Arizona in the Senate. A successful primary campaign would depend on his ability to craft a coalition of Latino voters and progressives. The ability to unite the party\u2019s liberal base with minority voters has been elusive for progressives in Senate races \u2015 endorsements by Obama helped deliver black voters to the establishment candidates in Florida\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate races in 2016.\n\nBut Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, has already teamed up with Latino Victory Fund to launch a digital campaign encouraging Gallego to run.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-public-lands-bill_us_5c6345f4e4b07115222af308": "The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly in support of a bipartisan public lands bill that safeguards more than 2 million federal acres and permanently reauthorizes the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, established in 1964 to protect natural areas and water resources.\n\nThe measure, which includes more than 100 individual pieces of legislation, is said to be the largest public lands package in a decade.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) signed a letter from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) calling on Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai to reject the merger between the third- and fourth-largest mobile service provider in the United States.\n\nThe proposed merger would leave Americans with just three wireless carriers with all the incentives to squeeze consumers for more money through increased prices and unnecessary fees, the letter argues. If approved, the merger would create a \u201ccountry-club market\u201d in which Verizon, AT&T and the new T-Mobile/Sprint could \u201cdivide the market, and collect ever-rising monthly rents from wireless subscribers with few real alternatives,\u201d according to the letter. (Verizon owns HuffPost.)\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) \u2014 who did not sign the letter \u2014 \u201cagrees with concerns expressed in the letter and hopes the Department of Justice rejects the proposed merger,\u201d according to a statement from Chris Harris, a spokesman for her Senate office.\n\nAdditionally, two potential but yet-unannounced Democratic presidential candidates, Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), also signed the Blumenthal letter.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS T-Mobile U.S. CEO and President John Legere testifies before the House commerce subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 13, 2019.\n\nThese Democratic senators have little power to stop the Trump administration from approving the T-Mobile/Sprint merger. Approval authority ultimately rests with the FCC and the Department of Justice.\n\nYet their stated opposition does show that the party\u2019s leading lights feel that it is important to take anti-monopoly stances in their pursuit of the presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party has increasingly embraced anti-monopoly and antitrust policies since the 2016 election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) labeled antitrust policy as one of the key planks in the party\u2019s new platform in a 2017 New York Times op-ed. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the new head of the House antitrust subcommittee, has promised to tackle head-on issues of consolidation in the pharmaceutical, hospital and tech industries.\n\nIn the recent past, Democrats have been more attentive to consolidation concerns in the telecommunications industry than in other sectors in which they allowed countless mergers during the presidency of Barack Obama. That could be due to the extreme consolidation already existing in this space. There are currently only four major mobile service providers \u2015 Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.\n\nThe Obama administration sued to block AT&T from purchasing T-Mobile in 2011 to prevent further consolidation that could raise prices and cost jobs. Then the Obama-era FCC prevented T-Mobile and Sprint from merging in 2014.\n\nThe Democratic Party has increasingly embraced anti-monopoly and antitrust policies since the 2016 election.\n\nThose same concerns exist in this second attempted merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. The Communications Workers of America argues that the merger will cost 30,000 jobs. Other telecommunications law experts argue that the merger will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers, who already pay among the highest prices for mobile service in the world. Rural mobile service advocates argued that the merger will dramatically increase costs for people living in areas with poor mobile service coverage and do little to improve that coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic 2020 candidates are rightfully expressing concerns and opposition to the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger, but the negative effects and potential damage of the merger should not be a partisan issue,\u201d said Shane Larson, director of legislation, politics and international affairs at the Communications Workers of America.\n\nThe Democratic candidates may be opposed to the merger, but an anti-monopoly spirit has not taken over the party entirely.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), a past critic of the telecommunications industry, declared her support for the merger at a congressional committee hearing on Wednesday. The country\u2019s telecommunications market is already dominated by the duopoly of Verizon and AT&T, she said. So, instead of breaking up these monopolies, T-Mobile and Sprint should be allowed to merge to create a third giant to take the Big Two on, she argued.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-hbo-documentary-2018-senate_us_5c5deb0ee4b0f9e1b17d13df": "A documentary crew followed former U.S. Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke and his insurgent 2018 Democratic campaign in Texas for a movie set to air this spring on HBO, the premium cable channel revealed Friday.\n\n\u201cRunning With Beto\u201d will premiere at March\u2019s South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, before airing as part of HBO\u2019s slate of 2019 programming, which the network announced at a panel for the Television Critics Association\u2019s winter preview.\n\nThe documentary, directed by David Modigliani, tracks O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign over the course of a year.

The 10-9 vote was along party lines, with every Democrat on the committee opposed.\n\nUnder current rules, senators have up to 30 hours to debate a nominee after they have voted to advance the nomination to a final vote \u2015 otherwise known as post-cloture time. Republicans say Democrats are wildly abusing this process to slow the confirmation of many noncontroversial lower court and administrative nominees. They point out that some government agencies are having to run with a bare-bones staff because many of their lower-ranking administrative nominees are still awaiting a confirmation vote.\n\nThe GOP proposal, which was introduced by committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and by James Lankford (R-Okla.), would limit that post-cloture debate time to two hours per nominee \u2015 significantly speeding up the process. It\u2019s similar to a temporary deal on nominations that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) negotiated with Republicans in 2013 \u2015 except the Blunt proposal would change the rules permanently.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to abuse the system like Democrats have been and not expect for people to try to end that abuse,\u201d Blunt told HuffPost last week.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees for lower-level government posts have had an unusually high number of calls for Senate cloture votes to cut off debate and move to the final vote, according to the Pew Research Center. However, Republicans employed the tactic of drawing out debate with equal zeal to slow the confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees after his re-election in 2012, a pattern that led to Reid\u2019s rules change in 2013.\n\nMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the rules committee, said during the markup hearing that Republicans are pursuing the change \u201conly because they want to ram more nominees through.\u201d She noted that part of the reason some government agencies aren\u2019t running at full capacity is that the White House simply hasn\u2019t nominated anyone to the posts.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal; this is not just a minor proposal to come our way,\u201d Klobuchar said on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the proposal was reported favorably out of committee on Wednesday, it will likely fall short of the 60-vote threshold necessary for final passage due to Democratic opposition. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier this week that he would oppose it unless Republicans agree to move the threshold on Supreme Court nominations back up to 60 votes or restore the use of \u201cblue slips\u201d over judicial nominees. Republicans abandoned the long-standing tradition after Trump\u2019s election, a practice that has been followed by both parties for decades and allows senators from a nominee\u2019s state to express their opinion on the individual.\n\nRepublicans suggested on Wednesday that they intend to move forward and pass the new rules proposal unilaterally by going \u201cnuclear\u201d on the Senate floor \u2015 a move that would require only 51 votes for approval.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a top ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said during the hearing.\n\nFew things generate acrimony in the Senate like rules changes \u2015 especially from those who are in the minority. Democrats complained about GOP obstruction on nominations under Obama and eliminated the 60-vote threshold on the president\u2019s picks to appeals courts as a result. When Republicans took power, McConnell subsequently changed the rules on Supreme Court nominations in order to confirm Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said a Republican proposal to change Senate rules and confirm presidential nominees more quickly does not \u201cin any way seriously disadvantage the minority.\u201d\n\nIn the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans have confirmed judicial nominees at a historic pace with scores of conservative new appeals, circuit and district court judges in the federal judiciary. They\u2019ve also succeeded in confirming two of Trump\u2019s picks to the Supreme Court: Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s refusal in 2016 to consider Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, remains a raw issue among many Democrats in the Senate. The blockade of Garland came up, again and again, at the hearing on Wednesday after Republicans complained about \u201crecord\u201d Democratic obstruction in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt was a conscious decision made by the majority leader to deny us the ordinary tradition of filling this vacancy,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told McConnell at one point.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/former-gop-rep-emergency-declaration-mcconnell_n_5c66d3b3e4b01757c36ae795": "While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced his support for President Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration for border wall funding, former Rep.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) is among the vulnerable lawmakers Sunrise Movement activists hope to pressure into supporting a Green New Deal.\n\nLast November, young activists wielding yellow signs calling for dramatic climate action and clean-energy jobs occupied Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, demanding top Democrats champion a Green New Deal.\n\nNow it\u2019s Republicans\u2019 turn.\n\nOn Wednesday, activists with the Sunrise Movement, the left-wing group whose protests propelled the Green New Deal into the national debate, are set to announce plans to start targeting Senate Republicans facing tough 2020 re-election bids in swing states, including Susan Collins (Maine), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), HuffPost has learned.\n\nSpokespeople for the senators did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nOther likely targets include Sens. David Perdue (R-Ga.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe move comes a day after McConnell, in an apparent bid to upend the Green New Deal\u2019s growing momentum, promised to hold a vote in the Senate on what\u2019s expected to be the landmark joint resolution Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) unveiled last week alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell is going to regret this sorry attempt to stop the Green New Deal,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, Sunrise Movement\u2019s executive director. \u201cHe is so out of touch with regular people and so in the pocket of his fossil fuel billionaire campaign donors that he thinks bringing the Green New Deal for a vote will be a political win for him and his fossil fuel billionaire cronies.\u201d\n\nThe group held a call at 8 p.m. Wednesday to rally its army of thous of volunteers.\n\nSunrise Movement isn\u2019t turning the heat down on Democrats, whom it sees as the primary vessels for pushing a patchwork of legislation to fulfill the goals outlined in the resolution, particularly in the lead-up to the 2020 election. On Wednesday, the group rallied more than 80 protesters outside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s New York office, calling on the Democrat to support the resolution.\n\nBut unlike health care, taxes and other policies with clear ideological battle lines, Republicans \u2015 no longer able to deny the science behind climate change outright as a large majority of Americans understand its realities \u2015 are struggling to articulate an alternative vision of how to prepare for an increasingly frightening, hot future. In the Sunrise Movement\u2019s view, the Green New Deal\u2019s momentum will take more cynical political ploys.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when McConnell will schedule the vote, but it could come as early as next month.\n\nThe Senate leader\u2019s announcement followed days of Republican attacks on the Green New Deal that ranged from traditional critiques of a big-government policy approach to wild-eyed tirades filled with blatant misinformation about the resolution itself.\n\nMichael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Sunrise Movement activists staged protests in November in then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez released a sweeping resolution last Thursday staking out the core tenets of a policy that aims to keep global warming from reaching cataclysmic levels, prepare the nation\u2019s infrastructure for the climate change already occurring and expand the social safety net for communities plagued by existing pollution. The measure calls for generating as close to 100 percent of the United States\u2019 electricity as possible from renewables over the next decade and ramping up manufacturing of clean-energy technologies, electric vehicles and public transit.\n\nRepublicans began attacking the policy before the resolution even came out.\n\nLast Wednesday, the day before the resolution\u2019s release, House Republicans referred to the general concept of a Green New Deal as a \u201cwealth transfer scheme\u201d and a \u201cradical policy.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday night, Fox News pundit Sean Hannity launched into a furious, minutes-long rant in which he called the Green New Deal \u201ca real, serious threat to our way of life\u201d and a \u201cdangerous idea\u201d without once describing the actual proposal. By Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that a Green New Deal would \u201cpermanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell is going to regret this sorry attempt to stop the Green New Deal. Varshini Prakash, Sunrise Movement executive director\n\nPartially fueling the attacks is a memo Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released last week with the resolution. The memo, described as an FAQ, contradicted the resolution by taking positions on nuclear energy, agricultural emissions and carbon-capture technology that didn\u2019t appear in the official legislation.\n\nBy sanctioning a vote, McConnell appears to be betting the mudslinging will make the resolution too radioactive to pass with a majority of Democrats, let alone any Republicans.\n\nThe policy polls strongly with voters. In December, 81 percent of registered voters supported the goals of the Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans, according to a poll from Yale and George Mason universities. A narrow majority of voters supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal, a survey released last month by the think tank Data for Progress found.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-federal-agency-staffing-impasse_us_5c632fa0e4b08da0ec7fb62a": "Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Jan. 9, before a meeting with President Donald Trump on the partial government shutdown. The stalemate over unfilled posts at federal agencies is just as serious.\n\nThere\u2019s an important battle brewing between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats, one with serious implications for the way the country is governed. No, I\u2019m not referring to the prospect of another government shutdown, though that is serious. I mean the actual staffing of the government, the top officials who run our federal agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s a contest with high stakes, particularly for Democrats, who control few levers of power in Washington, despite their new majority in the House of Representatives. And yet the tussle over regulatory nominations has flown under the radar in political media, obscured by more explosive confrontations.\n\nFor several months now, the Trump administration has kept Wall Street watchdog posts vacant by sitting on Democratic nominations. And for months progressive political organizations have been leaning on Senate Democrats to do something \u2015 anything \u2015 about it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is unprecedented,\u201d according to Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research. \u201cAnd the Democrats are allowing Republicans to do it without exerting either tactical leverage or rhetorical leverage by speaking out against it.\u201d\n\nMost federal agencies have a chairperson or top-level official who runs the show. The president gets to select that person, and while Democrats can cry foul over nominees they don\u2019t like, there isn\u2019t a whole lot they can do without Republican help to block a Trump candidate for these jobs.\n\nBut Democrats do have influence over a host of other positions that wield real power. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, is designed to be bipartisan \u2015 two of the five commissioners that run the agency can\u2019t come from the president\u2019s party. While the Republican majority will always have the final say, there\u2019s a lot that a Democratic commissioner can do \u2015 document corporate abuses, lean on enforcement staff and negotiate with Republicans over the regulatory agenda.\n\nConsider the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra published a pointed memo about the need to punish \u201crecidivist\u201d corporate offenders. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Facebook, which has been operating under a consent order from the FTC since 2011. Under the order, Facebook had agreed to reform the way it tracked user data and shared those data with other companies. If Facebook violated the terms of that order \u2015 and the company\u2019s mounting heap of scandals makes it seem increasingly likely that it did \u2015 then, Chopra suggested, the FTC should take strong punitive measures to demonstrate that large corporations are not above the law.\n\nChopra can\u2019t force the Republican-controlled FTC to actually do anything. But his memo made quite a splash. Where in the past, weak regulators might have hurried to absolve Facebook with a slap-on-the-wrist penalty, Republicans at the FTC now face the prospect of public humiliation if they carry water for the tech company during its ongoing meltdown.\n\nChopra is one of the few Democratic nominees to make it through the Trump administration logjam. Last summer, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recommended Trump fill open Democratic posts at the SEC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with longtime regulator Allison Lee and FDIC veteran Martin Gruenberg. In November, he recommended Graham Steele, a former staffer to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), for another FDIC post. Previous presidents quickly shepherded such recommendations to the Senate, but Trump has yet to formally nominate any of them. He has, however, found time to move ahead with installing a Republican replacement for outgoing Federal Housing Finance Chairman Mel Watt.\n\nIn December, Trump picked Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief economist Mark Calabria for the job. Calabria is a libertarian true-believer who advocates a return to the gold standard and has called to eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing giants he would regulate if confirmed as FHFA chairman. Calabria is scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\n\nLate last month, 20 progressive organizations signed a letter chastising Senate Democrats for inaction on Democratic appointees. By blocking or delaying Republican nominees, the groups wrote, Democrats could pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) into a deal in which the idle Democratic candidates are approved alongside Republicans \u2015 as was customary in previous administrations.\n\nSome of those progressive groups are now specifically calling for Democrats to block the Calabria nomination by placing a hold on it until other Democratic nominees are allowed to come to the floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible,\u201d said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, a net-roots group that focuses on contesting corporate power.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible. David Segal, Demand Progress\n\nIt\u2019s essentially a continuation of last year\u2019s fight between progressives and Schumer over the confirmation of federal judges. At the time, Schumer came under heavy fire for agreeing to confirm large batches of judges by unanimous consent, without securing any Democratic priorities in exchange \u2015 though Schumer (dubiously) argued that letting Democrats go home and campaign without missing votes would help them in the November election. But while Schumer took all of the heat last year, he was acting on behalf of his caucus. Senate Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, were happy to avoid a confrontation.\n\nPrivately, some Democratic staffers continue to insist they have no power. McConnell has final say over confirmation votes, they argue, and if he wants to bring up only Republican nominees, he can. Fighting, the thinking goes, will inevitably result in losing.\n\nBut one aide to a Democratic senator told HuffPost that Calabria\u2019s nomination will not be confirmed by unanimous consent, suggesting that someone \u2015 the aide did not specify who \u2015 will put a hold on the nomination.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats can\u2019t force McConnell or Trump to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. But they can create headaches for them, eating up valuable time on the Senate calendar by demanding that every GOP nomination proceed to a full floor vote. Approving candidates by unanimous consent is faster and leaves the Republican majority with more time to do what it wants to do. McConnell might very well prefer the calendar time to annoying floor fights and bad press from sabotaging the bipartisan nomination process.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-endorses-ending-us-support-for-saudi-arabia-in-yemen-war_n_5c642738e4b07115222c2912": "Mohamed Al-Sayaghi / Reuters A girl walks near her house destroyed in an airstrike carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in Faj Attan village, Sanaa, Yemen.\n\nThe U.S. House voted Wednesday to end American assistance for the Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen.\n\nThe measure, which is now expected to go to the Senate, is a show of force for Democrats and a new challenge to the kingdom and its allies in the Trump administration.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the resolution\u2019s main sponsor, finally pushed his bill through on a 248-177 vote after Republicans repeatedly blocked it in the previous session. The measure invokes congressional authority over war and peace to require President Donald Trump to withdraw U.S. forces involved in fighting in Yemen, except those battling the local branch of al Qaeda.\n\nIt reiterates the message of a similar bill that passed the Senate late last year, and supporters hope the legislation will soon make it through the upper chamber again. Passage would force Trump to change course or justify a veto by explaining his ongoing support for a policy that has killed thousands of Yemenis and contributed to mass starvation there since the U.S. began helping the Saudi-led coalition in 2015.\n\n\u201cToday is historic,\u201d Khanna said in a statement after the vote. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the direction people are pushing our party to take on foreign policy, promoting restraint and human rights and with the sense they want Congress to play a much larger role.\u201d\n\nThe measure\u2019s success in the House shows how much progress congressional critics of the war and activist groups have made in challenging the flow of American bombs, fuel and intelligence to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others battling Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.\n\nRepublican leadership stymied them in the House for years, shielding Trump from having to make a decision and protecting a strategy they view as a check on Tehran. They have used legislative maneuvers in three separate instances to keep Khanna\u2019s bill off the House floor.\n\nSkeptics of the war focused instead on winning over senators, tying concerns over Yemen to anger over the Saudi state\u2019s role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With a Senate win under their belt, they pushed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to promise an early vote once the new Democratic House came into session \u2015 and on Wednesday, she made good.\n\nAll Democrats present in the chamber and 18 Republicans ultimately voted for the measure. More than 50 Democrats did, however, back a successful GOP-led amendment affirming the president\u2019s right to share intelligence with foreign countries on vaguely defined national security grounds \u2015 a signal that will reassure Riyadh and make the next Senate effort more complicated, as the body will now no longer be voting on the same language it considered back in December.\n\nPressure from Congress and growing global frustration with the Saudis have driven the warring parties to take negotiations more seriously. Even Trump felt compelled last year to rein in U.S. military support, officially ending the practice of refueling Saudi coalition planes midair to allow them to take longer bombing runs \u2015 though he still has the right to change his mind, barring congressional action. A United Nations-brokered cease-fire has held since December with only a few exceptions.\n\nBut conditions are worsening for the tens of millions of Yemenis now dependent on some form of aid, and there\u2019s been little progress on that front. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is continuing its saber-rattling on Iran while downplaying outrage over Khashoggi, and there\u2019s growing evidence that American weapons given to the Saudi coalition have ended up in more dangerous hands.\n\nMuch of the GOP continues to argue that Yemen should be viewed primarily as a venue for confronting Iran, which has supplied the insurgent Houthi militia there. The resolution could represent a \u201cgreen light\u201d to the Houthis to continue taking arms from the Iranians and committing abuses like recruiting child soldiers, said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nAnd in the Senate, the 53-member Republican majority is unlikely to welcome a companion bill to Khanna\u2019s House resolution. A more targeted bipartisan package of sanctions on the Saudis over Yemen and Khashoggi hasn\u2019t yet made it to the calendar of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That panel\u2019s chair, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), opposed last December\u2019s Yemen withdrawal bill.\n\nOpponents of supporting the Saudi-led coalition \u2015 who have formed an expanding network that includes several top conservative groups \u2015 say they\u2019re energized for the next fight.\n\n\u201cCongress realized #YemenCantWait,\u201d Kate Kizer of the advocacy group Win Without War wrote on Twitter. \u201cOnto the Senate!\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, an unprecedented 56 senators voted to end all support for this war, and that vote put much-needed pressure on Saudi Arabia,\u201d Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation wrote to HuffPost in an email. \u201cNow, 51 of those senators are still serving in the Senate, and this legislation only needs 51 votes for passage.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congress-bucks-trump-federal-pay-raise_n_5c65b810e4b0bcddd40fd058": "Update: Both the Senate and House have passed the spending bill, and the White House said the president will sign it.\n\nThe members of Congress tasked with hashing out a plan to avert another government shutdown want to give federal employees a raise, defying President Donald Trump\u2019s previous efforts to freeze their pay.\n\nThe funding deal put together by Senate negotiators calls for a 1.9 percent across-the-board raise for government employees for 2019, half a percentage point more than their pay hike last year. The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to approve the bill Thursday, sending it to the Democratic-controlled House, where it also faces favorable odds.\n\nThe White House has not yet indicated whether the president will sign the legislation. The package includes $1.4 billion in funding for a physical barrier along the southwestern border \u2014 far short of the $5.7 billion Trump previously demanded. In fact, the deal is worse for Trump than he could have had in December, when he said he would \u201cproudly\u201d shut down the government to secure more money for a wall he used to promise Mexico would pay for.\n\nBut he was blamed more than Democrats for the record-setting 35-day shutdown and may accept the deal in order to avoid further political damage. If he does, the legislation will mark a retreat for Trump not just on the wall but also in his political fight with the federal workforce.\n\nSince taking office in 2017, Trump has tried to weaken government job protections and peel back collective bargaining rights, lumping civil servants in with what he calls \u201cthe swamp.\u201d He has also periodically wielded the threat of a government pay freeze, even while boasting about a strong economy and rising wages in the private sector.\n\nAfter the Senate proposed a 1.9 percent increase last year for 2019, he sent a letter to Congress saying he wanted to nullify it. He essentially said the government couldn\u2019t afford to pay any raises, even though Republicans recently passed tax cuts expected to increase the deficit by nearly $2 trillion through 2028.\n\nEven though a majority in the House \u2014 controlled at the time by the GOP \u2014 never signed off on a pay increase, an automatic 2.1 percent increase would have gone into effect anyway on Jan. 1., because of the federal pay schedule. But Trump intervened to block it, resetting the pay hike to zero through executive order.\n\nThe government was partially shut down at the time, with roughly 800,000 workers going without paychecks. A union for federal employees said Trump was \u201cpouring salt into the wound\u201d by pre-empting a raise when so many workers were furloughed or working without pay.\n\nThe 1.9 percent increase in the spending proposal would be the largest since 2009, though still below the raises that preceded the recession.\n\nBut now it would be much tougher for Trump politically to reject a modest across-the-board hike after a damaging shutdown. By and large, Americans sympathized with federal workers who were subjected to more than a month of financial anxiety through no fault of their own. In one U.S. poll, respondents said, 50 percent to 35 percent, that Trump should have compromised to avoid the funding lapse.\n\nThe National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, an advocacy group for federal workers, called the pay increase proposed in the potential spending deal \u201clong overdue common sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis average 1.9 percent pay increase is a small, yet positive, step to ensure the federal government can recruit and retain the best of the best for the benefit of the American people,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Ken Thomas.\n\nFederal workers have faced some lean raises in recent years, compared with historical standards. Then-President Barack Obama oversaw a three-year pay freeze in the wake of the Great Recession, though he tried to end it earlier than planned but was stymied by Republicans. Federal employees can still get raises through step increases during a pay freeze, but those depend on tenure and pay grade and aren\u2019t available to everyone in a given year.\n\nThe 1.4 percent pay increase in 2018 was the largest across-the-board pay bump in eight years. Each of the four preceding years saw a 1.0 percent increase. The 1.9 percent increase in the spending proposal would be the largest since 2009, though still below the raises that preceded the recession.\n\nIf Congress passes the spending bill and Trump signs it \u2015 they have until Friday night to avoid a shutdown \u2015 federal government employees will make out much better than government contractors.\n\nWhile the former were granted backpay by Congress after the last shutdown, the latter missed out on several weeks\u2019 worth of earnings while federal offices and functions were closed. Democrats and some Republicans tried to insert a provision in the current proposal to get those workers backpay, but it became a sticking point for GOP leaders. Ultimately, it was left out.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-mcconnell-vote_us_5c632ac9e4b08da0ec7fafd6": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) promised on Tuesday that he would allow a vote on the Green New Deal, the climate and energy proposal advanced by progressives that is meant to address the threat of climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noted with great interest the Green New Deal. And we\u2019re going to be voting on that in the Senate. Give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,\u201d McConnell told reporters at a press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution unveiled last Thursday is a nonbinding measure meant to define the scope of what future legislation requires to make a serious dent in surging greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe document calls for zeroing out emissions by generating as close to 100 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity as possible from renewables over the next decade, and ramping up manufacturing of clean-energy technologies and electrical vehicles to decarbonize other sectors.\n\nUnlike past efforts to reduce emissions, the Green New Deal takes stock of the fact that climate change uniquely touches on almost every part of the economy and threatens to wildly exacerbate a vast slate of social ills, including disease, poverty and structural racism. The resolution calls for universal health care, a guarantee of high-wage jobs to American workers displaced by the rapid transition away from fossil fuels, and explicit protections for marginalized communities and indigenous tribes.\n\nBy sanctioning a vote, McConnell appears to be betting that the resolution will prove too radical for a good number of Democrats, let alone any Republicans.\n\nWhile a number of Senate Democrats have endorsed the Green New Deal, including some who have declared presidential bids for 2020, others have exercised more caution when asked if they will support the measure.\n\n\u201cThere will be all kinds of bills sponsored by individual presidential candidates... I\u2019m not going to take position on every bill that\u2019s coming out,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a possible 2020 contender, said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Tuesday. \u201cI support a green new deal. I think we need to aggressively support climate change [legislation].\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also didn\u2019t seem too impressed with the Green New Deal resolution last week.\n\n\u201cIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive. The green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it, right?\u201d she said.\n\nIn December, a poll from Yale and George Mason universities found that 81 percent of registered voters supported the goals of a Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans. A narrow majority of voters support raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal, according to a survey released last month by the think tank Data for Progress.\n\nRepublicans largely remained silent on the Green New Deal late last year when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a cadre of left-leaning Democrats began demanding a select committee in the House devoted to the proposal. Last week, a day before the resolution\u2019s release, Republicans in two House committees slammed the idea of a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to reducing emissions, calling the Green New Deal too \u201cradical\u201d for the United States.\n\nWhen the resolution came out on Thursday, roughly 65 House Democrats co-sponsored it, while fewer than a dozen senators did the same.\n\nBut the numbers are growing. On Monday, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), a moderate Democrat from Long Island with a seat on the powerful House Committee on Ways and Means, said he would support the resolution. His status as the vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus suggests he could help woo Republican support for the measure.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of measure McConnell plans to bring up for a vote in the Senate. A spokesman for the majority leader told HuffPost on Tuesday that he will not be writing his own legislation to address the threat posed by global warming.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) criticized Republicans on Tuesday for pledging to hold what is essentially a show vote on the Green New Deal, given that they have not advanced any serious efforts to address climate change.\n\nWhen I say that R\u2019s have no plan for climate change, I know it\u2019s twitter and people are prone to exaggeration, so I want to be super clear: Republicans actually have no plan to address this threat to the planet. This is why young people are abandoning the Republican Party. \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) February 12, 2019\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Ocasio-Cortez introduced two companion resolutions to bring the Green New Deal to vote last week. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman also sent reporters a memo in which the congresswoman\u2019s office contradicted the resolution by taking positions on agricultural emissions, nuclear energy and air travel that did not appear in the formal legislation.\n\nAlthough Markey and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office subsequently distanced themselves from the memo, Republicans quickly denounced the resolution as a Trojan horse for more controversial, left-wing proposals that are unlikely to garner the same widespread support those outlined in the resolution might.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights,\u201d President Donald Trump said at a rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday, referring to the memo.\n\nSome Republicans even accused Democrats of proposing to do away with treats like ice cream by seeking to address bovine flatulence, which last week\u2019s memo highlights as a significant source of greenhouse gases.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-matthews-senate-shutdown_us_5c4ac88ae4b0e1872d429b4b": "MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews on Thursday took the Republican-controlled Senate to task for failing to deal with the ongoing partial government shutdown.\n\nThe \u201cHardball\u201d host questioned why senators even bothered bringing two potentially shutdown-busting bills to the floor earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cWhat do you make of this political gamesmanship that\u2019s going on?\u201d Matthews asked former Colorado Gov.

Some have been furloughed, while others, deemed essential, have been working without paychecks.\n\nAlthough federal employees will receive back pay after the government reopens, many are struggling to get by in the meantime. Potentially hundreds of thousands of government contract workers who are also out of work will likely never see retroactive pay.\n\nIt is still not clear when the shutdown might end, as President Donald Trump has shown no sign of budging on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 which Democratic lawmakers have firmly opposed. The Senate is set to vote on measures this week that could end the shutdown, but they seem unlikely to pass.\n\ncontracted workers with \u2066@32BJSEIU\u2069 are here to #OccupyHart #StopTheShutdown\n\n\n\nThank you all for always fighting, we are with you! pic.twitter.com/dB7vtoz0Re \u2014 Carlos Jimenez (@Union_Los) January 23, 2019", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/border-security-deal-reached_n_5c5d98c3e4b0650f4c0d5457": "WASHINGTON \u2015 With more than 24 hours to spare, a deeply divided House and Senate came together to pass a bipartisan government funding deal Thursday, avoiding another partial shutdown even as neither party sounded particularly ecstatic with the compromise.\n\nThe Senate passed the 1,100-page bill in a bipartisan vote of 83-16 Thursday afternoon, and the House approved the measure about six hours later, 300-128, with 109 Republicans and 19 Democrats voting against the agreement, and 87 Republicans and 213 Democrats voting yes.\n\nWhile the Senate vote was overwhelming, the House result was a little more mixed. Yes, both chambers showed more than enough support to override a presidential veto, but a majority of Republicans voted against the legislation, and Democrats didn\u2019t have enough support to pass the bill without GOP help. Still, short of a sudden but not impossible change of heart, President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation later Thursday night.\n\nTrump and other Republicans were always lukewarm about the deal \u2015 just like Democrats \u2015 because the legislation is a true compromise. Trump doesn\u2019t get a \u201cwall,\u201d but he does get $1.375 billion for \u201cbollard fencing,\u201d which he almost certainly will present as wall funding. He doesn\u2019t get to put the fencing wherever he wants, either, and he will have to work in consultation with local governments to construct it, but he does get 55 miles of new barriers.\n\nBoth parties also made concessions on funding for detention beds at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Last year, Congress authorized funding for 40,520 beds, but ICE greatly exceeded that number. As of Feb. 10, nearly 49,000 people were in ICE detention.\n\nAs part of the spending deal, the Trump administration wanted to provide funding for 52,000 beds, while Democrats wanted to reduce the number to 35,400. Ultimately, lawmakers agreed to gradually reduce detention beds to 40,520 \u2014 the same level authorized last year \u2015 by Sept. 30, but provide funding for an average of 45,274, while also eliminating the cap.\n\nDemocrats also failed to limit the number of migrants ICE can detain within the U.S. to a daily average of 16,500. They backed away from that request Monday night after pushback from Republicans, meaning that the deal reached this week places no hard cap on ICE\u2019s ability to detain people.\n\nLawmakers were also unable to reach agreement on backpay for federal contractors and an extension of the expiring Violence Against Women\u2019s Act, so neither will be included. And the bill won\u2019t block Trump\u2019s ability to declare a national emergency \u2015 which he announced Thursday that he intends to do \u2015 or restrain the administration\u2019s \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d sometimes referred to as the \u201cGlobal Gag Rule,\u201d which blocks funding for NGOs offering abortion services or counseling.\n\nBut there are still plenty of wins for Democrats in the bill. The measure delivers a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal workers, provides another $1 billion for the census, and adds $17 billion in funding for new infrastructure projects.\n\nThe legislation was the product of a bipartisan agreement on border security that lawmakers reached earlier this week after several weeks of bicameral negotiations. The measure would prevent a second partial government shutdown following last month\u2019s costly funding lapse that forced 800,000 federal workers off the job and cost the economy $11 billion.\n\nAlthough Trump seemed to indicate in December that he could agree to a government spending bill without funding for his promised border wall as long as discussion resumed in the new year, he changed course at the final hour. The resulting shutdown lasted a record 35 days, sparking turmoil at the nation\u2019s airports and economic strife for many of the government employees and contract workers forced to skip paychecks.\n\nDuring the shutdown, Trump repeatedly said any deal without $5.7 billion for a wall \u201cdoesn\u2019t work.\u201d He was willing to wait \u201cas long as it takes\u201d to get his wall money, he said, even if the shutdown lasted months or years. Trump went so far as to threaten to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency along the southern U.S. border, theoretically freeing up Defense Department funding to pay for the project.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rejected any spending deal that included a wall, offering instead billions in technological and staffing improvements along the border.\n\nMeetings between both sides produced dramatic headlines, but no real results.\n\nBy late January, the White House appeared to be feeling the heat as its representatives began making tone-deaf comments about the shutdown\u2019s human impact. Trump caved to the Democrats, agreeing to a three-week continuing resolution to fund the government through Feb. 15 while both parties in Congress hammered out a deal.\n\nAt the time, Trump said he was prepared for a second shutdown \u2015 or to issue a national emergency declaration \u2015 if a deal were not reached by the resolution\u2019s expiration date. McConnell said on Thursday that he supports an emergency declaration over the wall after previously cautioning the president against it.\n\nTrump is also reportedly considering a plan to obtain more funding for his wall via an executive order by shifting unspent federal dollars from areas like disaster-relief projects and military housing.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/armed-florida-teachers-bill-state-senate_n_5c643ed6e4b03de94297f0bf": "Phillip Valys/Sun Sentinel/TNS via Getty Images Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's cross country team stop by the makeshift memorials in front of the school on March 28, 2018.\n\nFlorida lawmakers marked the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland by pushing forward a new effort to put even more guns in schools.\n\nThe bill, which cleared the Senate Education Committee along party lines Tuesday, would allow teachers with concealed carry permits to bring their guns to school provided they receive more than 100 hours of firearms training from local sheriff\u2019s departments.

They staged marches around the country and the world to call for stricter gun laws. They inspired students across the country to walk out of their own schools in protest of having to live in fear of school shootings. And the parents of children who died in Parkland took lawmakers to task for their inaction on gun violence, even when the parents were blatantly disrespected by those same people in power time and again.\n\nJohanne Rahaman for HuffPost Protesters gathered at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Feb. 17, 2018, to demand gun control.\n\nArming teachers actually makes schools less safe, according to Bacardi Jackson, managing attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\u201cYou can look at the most hardened prison in America, hardened by every possible means, and that in and of itself teaches us that hardening places doesn\u2019t create safe spaces,\u201d Jackson told HuffPost. \u201cWhy would we want to create a prison-like environment that we know will not lead to a safer environment?\u201d\n\nAt least 28 states have policies that allow armed security personnel in schools, and at least eight states allow school employees themselves to carry firearms, according to a 2018 report by the Education Commission of the States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to make our voices heard, yet our lawmakers still ignore our efforts to save Floridian lives,\u201d said Jovanna Liuzzo, a recent high school graduate and volunteer at the Florida chapter of Students Demand Action, of the Florida bill. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our teachers to be armed. We want common-sense gun laws to make sure that people with dangerous histories don\u2019t have access to guns in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe idea that \u201ca good guy with a gun\u201d could stop a bad one, spouted by the National Rifle Association, has also been largely unfounded. As The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Rosenthal pointed out in 2012, multiple \u201cgood guys\u201d with a gun are more likely to confuse law enforcement officers looking for the \u201cbad guy\u201d with a gun.\n\nAbout the only thing more terrifying than a lone gunman firing into a classroom or a crowded movie theater is a half a dozen more gunmen leaping around firing their pistols at the killer, which is to say really at each other and every bystander. It\u2019s a police officer\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe FBI, in its review of 250 active shooting incidents in the U.S. from 2000 to 2017 found that in only seven cases did a civilian with a valid firearms permit actually stop a shooter.\n\nJackson said police officers already make difficult judgment calls that can sometimes lead to the deaths of innocent people. To give that heavy responsibility to civilian teachers seems callous.\n\nThe head of the Florida Education Association said that it\u2019s a responsibility that many teachers don\u2019t want.\n\n\u201cThis is the wrong conversation and the wrong decision coming from lawmakers,\u201d Fedrick Ingram told HuffPost. \u201cUnfortunately, they have not asked teachers how to make these schools safer, because any teacher will tell you that we need to be talking about counseling and mental health issues. Those are the things that will stop these issues before they happen.\u201d\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas commission, which released a report of more than 400 pages that has been the basis for the new bill, does not include any current teachers.\n\n\u201cThis MSD commission has lots of law enforcement folks, and we respect law enforcement, they do a great service, but there is not a [current] teacher on this commission,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cIf our lawmakers are following this commission, then they are not following the voices of our teachers and parents. The priority is wrong.\u201d\n\nManatee School for the Arts in Palmetto, Florida, will soon have two combat veterans in body armor roaming their school equipped with Glock handguns and semiautomatic rifles, The New York Times reported on Monday. The idea is for the weapons-ready veterans to take down a school shooter at a moment\u2019s notice. Jackson said that will only make students more afraid.\n\n\u201cI have three children, and I cannot imagine my children having to pass a man standing in their hallway with a bulletproof vest, a semiautomatic and a Glock \u2015 that\u2019s terrifying to me,\u201d she said.\n\nEven those given clearance to protect children in school with firearms can, and do, make costly mistakes. Two weeks after the Parkland shooting, a Georgia teacher barricaded himself in a high school classroom and fired a handgun. A short time after that, a school resource officer at a Virginia middle school accidentally discharged his service weapon inside his office.\n\nIn both of those cases, no one was hurt. But armed protection had already been in place at Stoneman Douglas the day of the deadly shooting. An armed school resource officer was standing outside the school as the shooting went on.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-el-paso-donald-trump_us_5c62280fe4b071a3b765ef7e": "EL PASO, Texas \u2015 Beto O\u2019Rourke directly challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration policies and painted the administration\u2019s efforts to build a wall along the southern border as dangerous and divisive during a rally Monday night.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of thousands within sight of the El Paso County Coliseum, where Trump spoke, the former Democratic congressman delivered an energized speech that recalled those he delivered in his unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign, a contest that vaulted him to the national stage. Amid wide expectation that he will launch a bid for the presidential nomination in 2020, O\u2019Rourke evoked key themes he honed while campaigning across the state \u2015 calling for a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and urging the country to welcome asylum seekers.\n\nIn stark contrast to Trump\u2019s doomsday vision of a crime-infested region under assault from foreign criminals, O\u2019Rourke offered a glowing vision of the border zone. Noting that migrants are statistically less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, O\u2019Rourke insisted that cities like El Paso, his hometown, are among the country\u2019s safest precisely because of their strong immigrant presence.\n\n\u201cIn El Paso, we are secure because we treat one another with dignity and respect.

Since then, he has maintained a low profile, rarely speaking to the press and offering only oblique remarks about whether he will launch a presidential bid. He told Oprah Winfrey earlier this month that he would decide before the month was out \u2015 a remark he repeated to supporters who shouted the question at him during Monday\u2019s event.\n\nBut the crowd seemed optimistic. Several people waved flags reading \u201cBeto for president\u201d or \u201cBeto 2020.\u201d The banners employed the same black-and-white graphics used in his Senate race, which saw voter turnout more than double in some border counties.\n\nO\u2019Rourke addressed the crowd at the same time Trump took the stage for his own rally just a few miles away. The president flew to the border city to make yet another public demand for $5.7 billion to begin construction on a border wall. Similar demands led to the country\u2019s longest government shutdown shortly before Christmas and lawmakers have been stymied thus far in their efforts to negotiate with the White House on a government funding package that would keep the nation running for the rest of the year.\n\nTrump cited El Paso in his State of the Union speech last week in an appeal to obtain money for the border wall, falsely claiming that the city was among the country\u2019s most violent until the federal government began fencing it off from its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. (In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nIt was those remarks, along with Trump\u2019s choice to hold a campaign rally in the heavily Latino border town, that prompted more than 50 civil rights and advocacy groups to organize the rally where O\u2019Rourke delivered the final address.\n\nTrump doubled down on his calls for a wall on Monday, saying his plans along the Rio Grande separating the U.S. and Mexico were already moving forward.\n\n\u201cToday we started a big beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande,\u201d Trump told supporters at the event, which was filled to capacity. \u201cRight smack on the Rio Grande.\u201d\n\nThe size of the crowds at the dual rallies symbolized a wider schism between the values of two social movements that will likely define the politics of 2020 \u2015 one fixated on security that views the border as a threat and an alternate view that champions openness.\n\nThe president addressed the lawmaker\u2019s competing event before flying out of Washington, telling reporters that he had a \u201cvery long\u201d line at his rally and that, though O\u2019Rourke had one too, \u201cit\u2019s a tiny, little line.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally, however, began with a large march through El Paso. Organizers estimated the crowd numbered 7,000 at its peak, citing law enforcement figures.\n\nAbout 7,000 on hand for @BetoORourke in El Paso tonight, per organizers, citing a law enforcement estimate pic.twitter.com/s5ldYnol5v \u2014 David Siders (@davidsiders) February 12, 2019\n\nJohn Campa, 30, said he had never attended a rally until two weeks ago. Monday night\u2019s march was his second, and he anticipated he would join more in the future because of Trump\u2019s hostility toward his hometown.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I don\u2019t like what he has to say about El Paso,\u201d Campa told HuffPost. \u201cEl Paso Is love. We gotta make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nRally-goers at times chanted \u201cno more lies\u201d as they followed O\u2019Rourke during the march, which numbered in the thousands, according to estimates by local media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re a community that\u2019s proud to be inclusive, proud to be welcoming \u201d said Robert Heyman, policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to stand against President Trump\u2019s racism, against Trump\u2019s wall.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke challenged his supporters to champion policies of inclusion during his speech, painting El Paso as a city built around community, not division.\n\n\u201cWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe are going to show the country who we are. We\u2019re going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with more details from the Beto O\u2019Rourke rally.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-filibuster-nuclear_us_5c5a286de4b00187b5560591": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Many Democrats say they oppose changing Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on legislation, otherwise known as the filibuster, despite some calls from the left urging them to do so to more easily advance their agenda in 2021.\n\nAmbitious Democratic proposals like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d or the Green New Deal stand little chance of becoming law in the near future given near-unanimous Republican opposition and the Senate\u2019s long-standing supermajority requirement. Even if Democrats manage to claw back to power in the Senate and recapture the White House in 2020, the GOP would likely prevent them from advancing to a final vote by using the filibuster.\n\nThat\u2019s why some on the left are pushing Democrats to either be honest with voters about the chances of passing major legislation they\u2019ve introduced or simply rip the Band-Aid off and ditch a rule that doesn\u2019t actually appear in the Constitution anyway.\n\n\u201cThe Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. [Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell] will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything. If Dems win the WH & Senate in 2020, they should nuke the 60-vote threshold on day one and get on with it,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for ex-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said last month.\n\nOther progressives like Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice have argued that Democrats stand to benefit more from eliminating the filibuster because Republicans are generally less likely to propose sweeping changes in domestic policy due to their conservative ideology.\n\nBut nearly a dozen Democrats rejected those arguments in interviews on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, calling the filibuster a critical tool that helps foster bipartisanship, as well as a means of guarding against political passions that can bubble up in the House and the executive branch. Many of those Democratic senators also expressed concern about a scenario in which Republicans once again controlled both Congress and the White House.\n\nIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)\n\n\u201cIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive to the nation. So while I understand the frustration ... I think the consequences of getting rid of it are too great,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday.\n\nIndeed, if the filibuster had not been on the books during the first two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans could have passed a whole host of legislation Democrats most likely would not liked to have seen become law \u2015 including, possibly, funding for his border wall.\n\n\u201cWhat you might think today would be in your favor, might not be in your favor tomorrow,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who was just elected to a six-year term, added on Tuesday.\n\nSome Democrats still harbor regrets over the decision in 2013 to unilaterally end the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. Democratic leaders said at the time they were forced to take the step to confirm a number of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees given unprecedented GOP obstruction from people like McConnell. Reid, who pulled the trigger on the rule change, still maintains that it was the right thing to do. But now that Republicans are confirming young, conservative judicial nominees at a historic pace under the Trump administration, some Democrats say there is reason for caution about going even further.\n\n\u201cI would remind people there was a lot of interest in getting rid of the filibuster for judges and for the Supreme Court, and that has not served us well,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked whether she supported eliminating the filibuster on legislation.\n\nMany 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls also share concerns about going nuclear to kill the filibuster. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the most recent entry in the field, said last week he would \u201cpersonally resist efforts to get rid of it.\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said last month she would consider ending the filibuster. In the meantime, the presidential candidate said that lacking 60 votes \u201cmeans you haven\u2019t done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a potential White House contender, has endorsed several progressive proposals on health care and climate change. He has also recently introduced legislation that would drastically expand the estate tax on the wealthy, a proposal he says would would raise $2.2 trillion. But the senator declined to address how to go about getting such proposals passed into law on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit speculative. I need to worry about what\u2019s happening in the country right now. That\u2019s a little bit into the future,\u201d Sanders said when asked whether he supported killing the filibuster.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, was the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who did not rule out the prospect of going nuclear in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cEverything stays on the table. You keep it all on the table. Don\u2019t take anything off the table,\u201d Warren said in an interview with Politico last week.\n\nThe debate over the filibuster is likely to heat up in the Democratic primary over the next two years with many progressives in the race floating a wish list of progressive proposals on everything from health care and taxes, to voting rights and climate change. But some Democrats think the conversation isn\u2019t exactly productive for the party when it comes to running Washington.\n\n\u201cSome of us have to think about governing. ... In terms of nuts and bolts, in terms of making this place work better, I don\u2019t think that talk is helpful,\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting he was not running for president.\n\nThe likelihood of ending the 60-vote threshold on legislation is extremely small in the near future due to bipartisan opposition. Trump repeatedly pushed McConnell to kill the filibuster last year in order to build the wall, for example. The Kentucky senator has resisted the president\u2019s entreaties, estimating in an interview last year that two-thirds of his caucus oppose doing so.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster, which has been around for a long time, is a problem. And it does, I think, generate on many occasions kind of a bipartisan solution, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always bad for the country,\u201d McConnell said in the interview.\n\nStill, progressives don\u2019t view the threat of a filibuster as an impediment to proceeding with legislation like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In fact, they argue that building political support for big new ideas often takes time, and the traditional place where that has occurred in the past is in the lower chamber.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-deal-border-wall-congress_n_5c658e6ce4b0bcddd40f794d": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump could have taken yes for an answer on border security. Instead, he decided to force a costly government shutdown over his proposed wall that angered just about everybody while producing no extra money for his priority.\n\nThe government funding bill that Congress is expected to send to the president\u2019s desk on Thursday provides just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 approximately the same amount of money for barriers that Congress offered the president late last year. A Senate committee approved even more for border security \u2015 $1.6 billion \u2015 in a bipartisan agreement last summer.\n\nBut Trump bet he could extract a lot more, as much as $5.7 billion, from the newly elected Democratic majority in the House by partially closing down the government and daring them not to blink and agree to fund a wall he initially said Mexico would pay for. Heeding calls from conservative media personalities like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter \u2015 his pseudo kitchen Cabinet \u2015 Trump refused to accept a deal that even Republicans had agreed to, thereby forcing 800,000 federal workers to go without pay in a shutdown that cost the economy $11 billion.\n\n\u201cThis White House, supposedly the best dealmakers on earth, really dropped the ball. I mean, we had a chance here to solve this problem two months ago without a shutdown,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is now planning to declare a national emergency to obtain the remaining funds to build the wall, the White House said. But that legally dubious option isn\u2019t likely to net him more miles of border barrier either.\n\nLast year, the president actually might have obtained as much as $25 billion to build his wall. The Senate considered legislation in February 2018 that would have funded the wall\u2019s construction in exchange for permanent protections for those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, providing a path to citizenship for some 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Dubbed the \u201cCommon Sense\u201d compromise, the bill seemed like the most viable way forward with some rare areas of bipartisan agreement.\n\nBut Senate Republicans, even those who were sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers, came out in opposition to the bill after the White House issued a veto threat and began whipping members to vote against it. The Senate bill failed to reach a filibuster-proof majority on a 54-45 vote, despite near-unanimous Democratic support.\n\nTrump attempted to revive a form of that deal in January, offering temporary protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding. Democrats refused, however, maintaining that three years of deportation relief for Dreamers, who remain in legal limbo since Trump rescinded their protections, wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy during the shutdown angered members of his own party as well. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) got into a heated confrontation with a fellow GOP senator during a weekly lunch last month as frustration reached a boiling point and poll after poll showed the American public blaming Trump and congressional Republicans over Democrats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the shutdown was a good idea. I think it was just all about point scoring. But a lot of people got hurt unnecessarily,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost this week, when asked if he felt that the shutdown had been worth the trouble. He lamented that Democrats seemed to be focused on \u201ctrying to embarrass\u201d Trump by opposing barriers on the border.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said they hoped the bitter monthslong fight over border security, with no additional funding to show for it, had taught Trump not to use the tactic again.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/severance-pay-required-toys-r-us_us_5c632e94e4b03de942966c22": "The recent mass store closures at retail chains Toys R Us and Sears have spawned a campaign to guarantee severance pay to laid-off workers. Its backers now face their first big legislative test: a bill in New Jersey that would make severance a requirement for large employers.\n\nIf the proposal succeeds, similar bills will almost certainly pop up in other states, the way minimum wage laws and paid sick leave protections have spread across the country in recent years, particularly in blue states.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the hope of workers like Bruce Miller. He lost his job as a Sears auto technician in 2018 when his store in Toms River, New Jersey, closed. He had 36 years with the company and received eight weeks of severance pay, an amount he believes should have been greater. He said severance should be mandatory and based on an employee\u2019s length of service.\n\n\u201cMost workers put their heart and soul into the job,\u201d said Miller, 56, who testified in favor of the bill last week. \u201cNot getting severance after you\u2019ve been there so many years, it\u2019s a punch in the gut. It\u2019s not fair to anybody out there.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey proposal, which was recently introduced in the state Senate, would assure laid-off workers one week of pay for every year they\u2019d worked at the company, which would be paid out by the employer, not the state. Had such a law been in place when Sears was axing workers, Miller would have received roughly nine months of salary, rather than two \u2015 a greater financial cushion for him and a greater cost for Sears.\n\nThe bill would make significant changes to the state\u2019s mass layoff law, which is based on the federal WARN Act. In addition to the severance requirement, it would increase the amount of advance notice that employers must give workers before making cuts: from 60 days to 90 days. Employers who failed to give such a heads-up would have to pay a minimum of four weeks of severance to an affected worker, no matter how long the worker\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe severance pay would come on top of the notice time during which the workers were still being paid, meaning the severance wouldn\u2019t kick in until after the 90 days had passed. The law would apply only to companies that were laying off 50 or more employees, meaning smaller businesses wouldn\u2019t be on the hook.\n\nEven so, business groups say the proposal worries them. Michael Egenton, a lobbyist with the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said the mandatory severance provision might be hard for failing businesses to meet. He argued that employers might balk at expanding into New Jersey if there were more workplace mandates, noting also the recent passage of a law requiring a $15 minimum wage by 2024.\n\n\u201cOur bigger concern is everyone is entitled to severance regardless of the financial situation,\u201d Egenton said, adding that he had industries other than retail in mind. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want our members in the pharmaceutical bio industry to start getting nervous, wondering what happens if [they] have to move employees around.\u201d\n\nNot getting severance after you\u2019ve been there so many years, it's a punch in the gut. Bruce Miller, a 36-year Sears employee who received just eight weeks of severance pay\n\nAs with the vast majority of states, severance pay is currently optional in New Jersey under most circumstances. Many companies therefore decline to offer any. Toys R Us, which was headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, didn\u2019t give store employees the severance they expected after it announced last year that the chain was shutting down. Only when workers organized and embarrassed the chain\u2019s owners did they establish a severance fund.\n\nThe effort in New Jersey grew directly out of that Toys R Us campaign. Infuriated over the lack of severance, former Toys R Us employees began publicly protesting against the bankrupt company\u2019s debtholders last year. They took on the name Rise Up Retail and began agitating for better protections for all retail workers who lose their jobs. The effort is backed by the Organization United for Respect, which has a history of organizing Walmart employees, and the liberal advocacy group Center for Popular Democracy.\n\nRise Up Retail has taken special aim at chains that were bought by private equity groups or hedge funds and later went bankrupt: Bain Capital and KKR in the case of Toys R Us and billionaire Eddie Lampert in the case of Sears. While all Toys R Us stores in the U.S. have closed, Lampert recently reached a deal to keep 425 Sears stores open.\n\nCarrie Gleason, policy director at Rise Up Retail, said laid-off workers would be less reliant on unemployment benefits if they received a week of pay for every year they\u2019d worked at a company. She also argued that investors might be less likely to close a struggling business and more eager to rescue it if shutting the doors required paying out severance. The owners of Toys R Us, she noted, rejected some offers to buy and reorganize the chain.\n\n\u201cIf you could imagine where someone got three months\u2019 notice [and] then a week of severance for every year, they would just about have enough [of] the real time it takes to find a job,\u201d Gleason said. At chains like Sears and Toys R Us, she added, many workers were mid-career or older and suddenly found themselves having to start over while facing age discrimination.\n\nAs for whether her group will push for severance laws beyond New Jersey, \u201cWe\u2019re already hearing from interested policymakers around the country,\u201d Gleason said.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images\n\nZach Herman, a researcher at the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state legislation around the country, said New Jersey is the only state with such a proposal on the table so far this year. Maine, he noted, already has a similar severance law on the books, requiring a week\u2019s pay for each year of service in mass layoffs, although only for employees with at least three years on the job. Several other states require severance only when the employer fails to give the legally obligated warning. (That\u2019s the current law in New Jersey.)\n\nThe proposal has a good chance of passing in New Jersey, where Democrats control both chambers of the statehouse and the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, has promised progressive reforms. Still, Egenton, of the state chamber of commerce, said he hopes a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d can be reached, with softer severance provisions to placate businesses. He also said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if employers fought the measure in court if it became law.\n\nBruce Miller said he hopes the bill passes as is. He worked on commission at Sears, and his earnings fell late in his career as the company\u2019s business dropped off. He was already facing foreclosure when he lost his job, he said. If he\u2019d had a week\u2019s salary for every year he worked, Miller added, maybe he could have worked out arrangements with his lender rather than losing his home.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ilhan-omar-resign_us_5c62ff37e4b00ba63e4b0e3f": "\u201cWe have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity,\u201d Omar wrote in a statement Monday. \u201cThis is why I unequivocally apologize.\u201d\n\nBut the president claimed Tuesday that Omar\u2019s apology was \u201clame\u201d and that her comments are \u201cdeep-seated in her heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t mean a word of it,\u201d Trump said of her apology.\n\nOmar\u2019s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-victory-spending-deal_n_5c64ac0de4b0aec93d3b012e": "Bloomberg via Getty Images If Democratic leaders can contain their defections to single digits, it will certainly seem like Democrats won this deal.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 As of Wednesday night, the spending deal to avoid another government shutdown still hadn\u2019t been finalized, but House Democrats were more than ready to pass the legislation and declare victory as soon as Thursday \u2015 even if the actual agreement is less of a win than they claim.\n\nLawmakers expect to release text late on Wednesday of a deal that would provide money until October for the same government agencies that were shut down in parts of December and January. Without the new deal, those agencies would close down again on Saturday, and for many lawmakers, avoiding another shutdown is reason enough to vote for the bill.\n\nBut Republican and Democratic leaders are also going around to their members and selling the agreement as a win for their side when the truth is a bit more drawish.\n\nNo, President Donald Trump does not get money for a concrete wall \u2015 or even as much money as Senate appropriators were discussing in the spring for physical barriers \u2015 but the deal does include $1.375 billion for \u201cbollard fencing.\u201d If you don\u2019t know what bollard fencing is, it sort of looks like a massive steel wall.\n\nDemocrats will be able to tout that the bill explicitly blocks Trump from using that fencing in certain areas, and that Trump can only use wall designs that are currently in use, and that Trump only gets 55 miles of new fencing. But Democrats are coming off of their position that $0 ought to go to a physical barrier.\n\nTrump will get to stand in front of the new fencing and point to it as his wall, and he\u2019ll still be able to declare a national emergency and try to raid other accounts for more wall money. There are no policy riders in the bill blocking Trump from that gambit, though such a move will almost certainly get tied up in the courts.\n\nRegardless of who\u2019s actually winning on the policy, Democrats are almost certainly winning on the politics.\n\nOne of the most complicated issues in the deal is the number of detention beds at the border. If you listen to Democrats, the deal will reduce the number of detention beds to 40,520, which is the number Congress previously agreed to. But, if you talk to Republicans, the legislation actually removes the cap and funds an average of 45,274 beds, according to Vox. A senior Democratic aide told HuffPost that there are currently 49,057 beds in use, so even though lawmakers are funding more than what they previously authorized, that\u2019s just to provide for a \u201cglide path\u201d to get to the mandated limit.\n\nThe truth is, we might not know exactly what these provisions do until we see the legislative text \u2015 and even then, the Trump administration could find a way to work around the law. Either way, they\u2019re still a far cry from the policies of those who want to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d or dramatically curb the United States\u2019 immigrant detention policies.\n\nThere\u2019s also a grab bag of other items that didn\u2019t go Democrats\u2019 way. The legislation won\u2019t include back pay for federal contractors who were shut out of their job for 35 days during the last shutdown. The bill won\u2019t restrain the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d sometimes referred to as the \u201cGlobal Gag Rule,\u201d which blocks funding for NGOs offering abortion services or counseling. And, in the words of one senior Republican aide, it maintains a number of other \u201cpro-life provisions\u201d that Democrats looked to address.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats point out that the legislation delivers a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal workers, increases the current spending for the census by a $1 billion, and provides $17 billion for new infrastructure projects.\n\nBut regardless of who\u2019s actually winning on the policy, Democrats are almost certainly winning on the politics.\n\nDemocratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats would support the deal, which seemed to square with what progressives said as well. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of the most liberal voices in Congress, told HuffPost he was \u201cinclined to be supportive\u201d and predicted that only \u201ca handful\u201d of Democrats would vote no.\n\nAnother California progressive, Rep. Jared Huffman, also predicted a small number of defections and said he was \u201cprobably a yes.\u201d\n\nWhile Huffman expressed concern about a few provisions and Democrats muddying their moral argument against walls \u2015 \u201cThere\u2019s a small amount of mud that I will concede\u201d \u2015 he said he thought this was overall a pretty good deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody should be claiming this as a victory, certainly not a complete victory, but I think there is a recognition that you can\u2019t fight every battle as your last one,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd plenty of other progressive Democrats seemed to be on the same page Wednesday. The only Democrat HuffPost talked to who seemed to be leaning no \u2015 though said she was still undecided \u2015 was Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). The freshman congresswoman said she was particularly concerned about accountability and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut if Democratic leaders can contain their defections to single digits, it will certainly seem like Democrats won this deal, particularly if a significant number of Republicans also defect from their leaders and vote no.\n\nI don\u2019t know that anybody should be claiming this as a victory, certainly not a complete victory, but I think there is a recognition that you can\u2019t fight every battle as your last one. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.)\n\nWhile only a handful of Democrats look poised to break ranks, dozens of Republicans seem prepared to do so, even with Trump supporting the bill.\n\nIf Trump started trashing the deal \u2015 or just sounding more tepid than he already does \u2015 Republicans defections could multiply. Suddenly, this bipartisan deal could look like a huge win for Democrats and a big loss for Republicans, just by virtue of a nearly united Democratic caucus voting for the bill and Republicans splitting off.\n\nMost members of the Freedom Caucus already sounded uncomfortable with the legislation before its release, and there are even members recycling the old complaint that there won\u2019t be enough time to \u201cRead The Bill\u201d before they vote on it.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do a one-week [continuing resolution] so we can all read it and know what\u2019s in it, fund the government, and make an informed vote?

The consequences of the showdown have been mounting for 800,000 federal workers forced off the job, with many struggling to pay rent and other bills after missing paychecks.\n\nA top Trump adviser warned this week that the economy may show no growth in the first quarter if the shutdown lasts much longer.\n\nDemocrats say they oppose building the wall \u2014 which Trump as a candidate promised Mexico would pay for \u2014 because it would be an ineffective deterrent against unauthorized immigration. They also argue that giving in to the president now would simply legitimize the tactic of shutting down the government over policy disagreements in future budget fights.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, say additional barriers on the border are common-sense and needed. They also point out that congressional Democrats have agreed many times to fund construction of barriers on the border \u2015 under Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if anything, Thursday\u2019s votes accomplished.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in his office Thursday afternoon to discuss a way forward that involves reopening the government for three weeks while both sides continue talking over border security. The 30-minute discussion between two leaders followed weeks of competing rhetoric on the Senate floor, leading some observers to believe that a breakthrough on the shutdown was near.\n\nBut the idea quickly ran into opposition from the White House, which insisted in a statement on Thursday that any short-term measure reopening the government include a \u201clarge down payment\u201d on the wall.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, said they could not support the idea of giving Trump funds for his border wall unless he reopens the government first.\n\n\u201cWhat does he hold workers\u2019 wages hostage for next? How many times will he try to hold wages hostage?\u201d Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) told reporters on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) haven\u2019t spoken in weeks \u2015 save for a sharp exchange of letters about postponing the president\u2019s annual State of the Union address because of the shutdown.\n\nPelosi on Thursday similarly shot down the latest White House proposal to fund the wall.\n\n\u201cThat is not a reasonable agreement between senators,\u201d Pelosi said on the House floor.\n\nA group of House Democrats are working on a package that would meet Trump\u2019s request of $5.7 billion but only for border security measures other than a wall, such as technology, more agents and measures intended to fortify ports of entry. It\u2019s unclear if he would accept such a proposal, but the legislation would allow some anxious Democrats to say they are negotiating with the president in good faith and trying to reopen the government.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-ojeda-drops-out-of-presidential-race_us_5c4b6624e4b06ba6d3bccc26": "Former West Virginia state Sen.

The votes generally fell along party lines, with Republicans saying the hike would be too extreme, particularly in more rural areas.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker, the new Democratic governor, has already indicated he would sign what he called \u201chistoric legislation,\u201d saying $15 was an appropriate floor across the state.\n\nThe minimum wage in Illinois is currently $8.25 per hour. The bill would gradually raise it in installments, first to $9.25 next January, then to $10 next July, and then $1 each new year until 2025, when it would reach $15. Backers of the bill argued that the piecemeal increases would create less of a shock for employers having to pay the higher wages.\n\nChicago Tribune via Getty Images Many Democratic lawmakers have gotten onboard with the concept of a $15 minimum wage thanks to the Fight for $15, a union-backed worker campaign that began in the fast-food industry in 2012.\n\nThe legislation and the politics surrounding it are similar to what just happened in New Jersey, where a $15 plan was signed into law earlier this month. Democrats in both states previously controlled both chambers of the statehouse, but winning the governor\u2019s mansion as well has given them the opportunity to pass progressive laws over the objection of Republicans.\n\nPritzker, like Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in New Jersey, has said hiking the minimum wage would be a priority for his administration. His predecessor, Republican Bruce Rauner, vetoed a similar bill Democrats sent him in 2017.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers by and large have gotten onboard with the concept of a $15 minimum wage \u2015 a progressive pipe dream just a few years ago \u2015 thanks almost entirely to the Fight for $15, a union-backed worker campaign that began in the fast-food industry in 2012. The sight of McDonald\u2019s workers walking off the job in protest of low pay helped spur legislation and ballot initiatives in cities and states across the country.\n\nNow it seems there is little to stop $15 proposals in blue states where Democrats control the levers of government. Illinois is now on track to become the fifth state with a $15 floor, following California, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.\n\nEven so, the Illinois bill is not an unqualified victory for unions and worker groups. In a win for the service industry, the legislation does not touch what\u2019s known as the \u201ctip credit\u201d \u2015 the ability of restaurants and other gratuity-based businesses to pay a lower base minimum wage, letting tips make up the difference. The legislation will allow restaurants to continue paying 60 percent of the regular minimum wage.\n\nThat means the lower tipped minimum wage will go up over time, eventually to $9 when the regular minimum wage hits $15, but it won\u2019t be eliminated the way liberal groups have sought.\n\nEmployers can also pay a lower minimum wage to minors who work fewer than 650 hours annually, the equivalent of about 16 full-time weeks. That minimum wage will top out at $13, rather than $15, in 2025.\n\nRepublicans had also sought a lower minimum wage outside the more expensive Chicago area but didn\u2019t get it.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-mistreat-staff-harry-reid_us_5c5db1ece4b03afe8d674530": "Bill Clark via Getty Images Complaints about Sen. Klobuchar's mistreatment of staff date back to her first run for Senate.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s mistreatment of her office staff began more than a decade ago and eventually caused such concerns that in 2015, then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) spoke to her privately and told her to change her behavior, multiple sources have confirmed to HuffPost.\n\nKlobuchar, a Democrat who plans to announce whether she\u2019s running for president at a rally in Minneapolis on Sunday, has faced trouble hiring campaign aides because of her history of mistreating staff.\n\nA spokesman for Reid said the retired senator prefers not to discuss private conversations he had with other senators. In this case, Reid also does not remember whether or not he had this discussion with Klobuchar, the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cSen. Klobuchar is one of the most brilliant, hardest-working members of the Senate, and I was glad to serve alongside her,\u201d said Reid. \u201cShe\u2019s tireless when it comes to fighting for the people of Minnesota and the country, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s such a popular Senator back home and among her colleagues.\u201d\n\nBut Reid\u2019s 2015 admonishment of Klobuchar appears to have been a rare point of intervention in a long history of complaints about Klobuchar\u2019s behavior, which date back to at least her time as the Hennepin County attorney in Minneapolis. That was the job Klobuchar had when she first ran for Senate in 2006.\n\nDuring that first campaign, aides assembled an eight-page memo outlining the duties of Klobuchar\u2019s body person, the staffer who oversees all of the logistics and personal needs of a candidate. It was frank about the challenges of working with the then-candidate.\n\n\u201cEspecially while in the car during a busy day: if she is EXTREMELY upset about something, let her rant through it, DON\u2019T interupt [sic] her unless ABSOLUTELY necessary and be careful when trying to calm her down,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cOften she just needs to talk things out in the open and is not interested in other people\u2019s opinions\u2015this is something that you will become used to and adjust to\u2015its just a note for the first time this happens.\u201d\n\nIn response, Ben Goldfarb, who managed her 2006 campaign, said, \u201cRunning for political office is incredibly hard for the candidate, their family and staff, and our team was proud to help elect her.\u201c\n\nDuring that same campaign, the president of the AFSCME local, the union that represented many of Klobuchar\u2019s employees in the county attorney\u2019s office, asked the larger Twin Cities AFSCME affiliate not to endorse Klobuchar\u2019s Senate bid, citing her \u201cshameful treatment of her employees.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar had \u201ccreated a hostile work environment\u201d and \u201cseverely damaged the morale of the office,\u201d wrote James Appleby, the president of the local. The letter claimed that grievances to the union increased under Klobuchar\u2019s tenure and that Klobuchar once told her own employees they weren\u2019t competent enough to work at her former law firm. It also claimed the local had asked the union to withhold its endorsement for her county attorney bid in 2002.\n\n\u201cIn short, Amy Klobuchar is exactly the kind of candidate that AFSCME should oppose,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe letter, which Appleby provided to HuffPost (and which is reprinted below), followed a contentious battle over potential pay raises for Klobuchar\u2019s staff, more than 100 of whom were represented by AFSCME. The union claimed Hennepin County attorneys were among the worst paid in the state after years of being the best paid.\n\nAt the time, Klobuchar said she advocated for a salary increase but was constrained by budgetary concerns, and she disputed the letter\u2019s claim that union grievances increased under her leadership.\n\nStaff are staff, they\u2019re not maids. There\u2019s a difference between \u2018Make sure I have a Diet Coke at an event\u2019 and \u2018Pick up my dirty clothes while you wait for me to get dressed.\u2019\n\nShe and her staff maintained that the letter was backlash over the salary negotiations, according to a 2006 Star Tribune article. A county board official said at the time that Klobuchar had fought vigorously for the increase, and Paul Scoggin, a managing attorney in her office, praised her as a \u201cterrific leader.\u201d He called the letter \u201cmean-spirited and angry.\u201d\n\nScoggin did not respond to interview requests. A former manager in the office said it was hard to imagine how Klobuchar created a morale problem given that most of the attorneys didn\u2019t have day-to-day contact with her. \u201cCan she be hard to work for? Yeah, because she never stops working,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that burns some people out, and that\u2019s the job.\u201d\n\nThe letter, in a passage that potentially echoes sexist stereotypes about female elected officials, also claims that Klobuchar\u2019s political ambition compromised her management of the office. It accuses her of taking credit for her employees\u2019 hard work by being the public face of the office and rejecting qualified job applicants to work in her office in favor of \u201ccandidates who support her ambitions.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar, a talented retail politician who visited every one of the state\u2019s 87 counties, won her 2006 election easily and has been re-elected twice by wide margins.\n\nBut as HuffPost reported Wednesday, concerns about how she treated her staff followed her to Washington, where her rate of staff turnover is consistently one of the highest in the Senate.\n\nFormer members of her staff told HuffPost that Klobuchar ground down morale with constant and cruel late-night emails and claimed staff was required to perform personal duties for her \u2014 such as washing dishes in her home \u2014 in violation of the Senate\u2019s rules and federal law against personal use of the office.\n\nOther people in her Senate offices feel that many criticisms of Klobuchar could be a product of sexism, sources told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say she\u2019s tough to work for, and I sometimes cringe when I hear it because I rarely hear that said about male bosses in Congress despite the fact that half of Congress is tough to work for,\u201d said Tristan Brown, a former legislative aide.\n\nMaking personal demands of staff is an extremely common practice in the Senate and the body has weak procedures for enforcing its rules. The House, by contrast, calls out its members for breaking the same federal law somewhat more regularly.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a comparable set of rules around the use of campaign staff. And in the frenzy of a Senate race, it isn\u2019t unusual for campaign workers to do personal errands \u2014 getting the dry cleaning, cleaning a car \u2014 for which the candidate simply doesn\u2019t have time.\n\nWhen Klobuchar ran for re-election in 2012, her staff re-used the body person memo from 2006, a 2012 staffer said. Most of the notes for the body person are typical, with instructions for which of her belongings to pack and how to politely keep her on schedule. (A former staffer provided a copy on the condition that HuffPost not publish the entire memo.) Memos like these are not uncommon: In 2017, Politico revealed the existence of an eight-page document from then-Rep. Todd Rokita\u2019s office that dealt solely with how to chauffeur the Indiana Republican around his district.\n\nStill, a former longtime advance man who reviewed the Klobuchar campaign memo for HuffPost said that it contained duties he felt crossed a line and that the memo at times is jarring, such as when it reads, \u201cOnly speak when spoken to at events,\u201d so as not to unnecessarily prolong a conversation.\n\nThe section that troubled him most was titled \u201cPersonal Preferences & Needs at Home.\u201d It described what the body person ought to do \u201cDuring free time or when waiting in her room (dressing area/bedroom)\u201d:\n\nHang up clothes she leaves laying on the floor & her chair\n\nPick up dirty clothes & place in a basket (in the hallway between room & bathroom)\n\nOrganize clothing in the closet so she can find items easily (separate into shirts, suits, etc)\n\nThrow away any garbage in the dressing area\n\nMake sure nylons/socks/etc are in drawers are arranged for easy retrieval\n\n\u201cStaff are staff, they\u2019re not maids,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between \u2018Make sure I have a Diet Coke at an event\u2019 and \u2018Pick up my dirty clothes while you wait for me to get dressed.\u2019 \u2026 I get it. Candidates\u2019 lives are incredibly demanding, and unless you\u2019re worth millions and you can pay someone to staff your house, sometimes political staff, they jump in and fill that void. And it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s office and her campaign did not reply to questions for this article. In response to HuffPost\u2019s initial story, Klobuchar\u2019s campaign said the senator \u201cloves her staff.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has many staff who have been with her for years \u2015 including her Chief of Staff and her State Director, who have worked for her for 5 and 7 years respectively \u2015 and many who have gone on to do amazing things, from working in the Obama Administration (over 20 of them) to running for office to even serving as the Agriculture Commissioner for Minnesota. She is proud of them and the work they have done for Minnesota,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe former advance man, who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could compare his own work experiences, was also struck by the memo\u2019s warning about Klobuchar\u2019s outbursts.\n\nHe said it is normal for senior staff to warn body people of a candidate\u2019s quirks and the ways they unwind in private. He\u2019s seen plenty of candidates climb into the car after an event and begin to rant. \u201cSo you let them,\u201d he said.\n\nIt crosses a line, he said, \u201cif they\u2019re taking it out on the person sitting there.\u201d\n\nThat is broadly the problem that former Klobuchar staff and those who have interacted with them describe.\n\nA former aide to ex-Sen. Al Franken recalled an encounter at a Veterans Day event to which Klobuchar was running late. (Franken, another Minnesota Democrat, resigned from the Senate in December 2017 after multiple women accused him of groping them or forcibly kissing them, often at political events.)\n\nA young Klobuchar staffer was sent to explain the senator\u2019s lateness to the Franken staffer.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/don-lemon-national-emergency_n_5c66caa2e4b01757c36ac7e7": "CNN\u2019s Don Lemon delivered a scathing rebuke of President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to declare a national emergency to build his promised border wall, calling it a made-up crisis that\u2019s \u201cnot fooling anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this, this whole mess, is manufactured,\u201d the anchor said during his Thursday night broadcast. \u201cA non-crisis at the border that\u2019s really not fooling anybody.\u201d\n\nTrump said he\u2019ll sign the congressional budget deal that doesn\u2019t fund his signature campaign promise to build a border wall \u2015 a stinging defeat for the president after his wall demand forced the record 35-day government shutdown.

The bill, which also calls for major changes the would restrict asylum laws for Central American minors, is likely to get little or no Democratic support.\n\nUnder the McConnell-Schumer deal, the Senate will also vote Thursday on a House-passed bill that would provide funding to re-open all parts of the government until Feb. 8 while congressional leaders and Trump focus on trying to reach an accord on border security issues. This measure is unlikely to get enough Republican support because it does not include funding for Trump\u2019s border wall, which as a candidate he promised Mexico would pay for.\n\nOnly 10 GOP senators signed a bipartisan letter earlier this month calling on Trump to reopen the government with a similar short-term measure while negotiations over the border issues proceed. That\u2019s short of the 13 Republicans needed to advance the measure, assuming all 47 members of the Senate Democratic caucus support it. The GOP\u2019s Senate leadership actively lobbied members against signing the letter.\n\nThe purpose of Thursday\u2019s showdown may be more political than practical \u2015 Anxious senators up for re-election in 2020 on both sides of the aisle would be able to tell constituents and federal workers they voted to re-open the government.\n\nMcConnell in a Tuesday floor speech urged Democrats to \u201cput country over party\u201d and \u201ctake yes for an answer\u201d by accepting Trump\u2019s offer, which the president announced over the weekend in a speech at the White House.

He called the proposed changes to asylum law in the bill a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d and said the measure is \u201cgoing nowhere fast.\u201d\n\nThe competing rhetoric that had little chance of resolving the shutdown that began on Dec. 22 occurred as some furloughed federal workers lined up at a food bank in downtown Washington, just blocks from the White House.

The surprise troop announcements also alarmed Republicans on Capitol Hill, who managed to convince Trump to delay the pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria for several months to ensure a slow and orderly withdrawal.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted 68-23 to advance an amendment offered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a key Trump ally, that expressed the sense of the chamber that the U.S. \u201cfaces continuing threats from terrorist groups operating in Syria and Afghanistan\u201d and that the \u201cprecipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.\u201d\n\nWhile the amendment is a nonbinding provision without the force of law, it sent a clear message to the White House that any plans to immediately pull troops out of war zones could jeopardize the fight against groups like the so-called Islamic State, leave Kurdish allies on the ground defenseless, and embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran.\n\nWhether to withdraw from the conflicts could become a big issue in the coming Democratic presidential primary, however. Many likely or declared candidates have struggled to voice a clear position on Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves in the Middle East.\n\nThe vote to advance McConnell\u2019s amendment took place just a day after Trump called the heads of his own intelligence agencies \u201cnaive\u201d on Twitter for contradicting him about the threats North Korea and the Islamic State pose to the U.S. The tweet came after Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel testified on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Intelligence should go back to school,\u201d Trump said in the tweet on Wednesday, which is only the latest example of him ridiculing and refusing to take advice from his own top national security advisers.\n\nTrump\u2019s public broadsides against the intelligence community \u2015 which follows his denials about the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessments regarding the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 presidential election \u2015 irked GOP leadership in the Senate this week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you can say this but I prefer the president would stay off Twitter \u2014 particularly with regard to these important national security issues,\u201d Sen.

The measure is all but certain to fail in the Senate and would be impossible to pass in the House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond poisoned pills \u2015 they didn\u2019t even try,\u201d Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services, told HuffPost. \u201cThere\u2019s not even an iota of effort to come up with a compromise. It\u2019s shocking.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump unilaterally canceled DACA in September 2017, many observers assumed that he did so in order to give himself leverage to demand concessions from Democrats related to immigration and border security \u2015 like funding for a U.S.-Mexico wall, for example. Holding the security of 700,000 Dreamers hostage in order to fulfill his controversial campaign promise does have a certain logic to it.\n\nEvents since his DACA strike have undermined Trump\u2019s position somewhat. Multiple federal judges have temporarily blocked the program\u2019s cancellation and so far the Supreme Court has refused to fast-track its consideration of the injunctions that allow Dreamers to keep renewing their DACA protections \u2015 for now.\n\nTrump still has tremendous leverage when it comes to DACA. Having been created through executive action, the program can be reversed by hostile presidents who follow the law. And the program is currently stuck in legal limbo. Supporters of immigration reform, including Dreamers themselves, have long demanded a permanent solution, ideally with a pathway to citizenship.\n\nBut Trump is not a Machiavellian strategist, using the twin weapons of deception and terror to achieve his ends. He\u2019s merely an obstructionist self-promoter for whom disaster is its own reward, as long as it\u2019s on brand.\n\nThat\u2019s why he threatened to veto \u2015 and thereby doomed \u2015 a bill last year that would have made DACA permanent and set out a pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion in wall money. And that\u2019s why the draft bill unveiled Monday night made an offer that the Democrats couldn\u2019t possibly accept.\n\n\u201cThis is so far away from a good faith effort,\u201d said Philip Wolgin, the managing director for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near \u2018Let\u2019s make a trade: DACA for the wall.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome observers casting about for signs that a rational mind in the White House might honestly be cooking up a solution to the problem of Trump refusing to sign a shutdown-ending bill without some wall money are now watching Jared Kushner. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser is trying to \u201cfigure out what bigger immigration reform looks like,\u201d including a possible \u201cpath to green cards\u201d for DACA recipients, according to an Axios report on Wednesday.\n\nThe phrase \u201cpath to green cards\u201d is another way of saying the more commonly heard \u201cpathway to citizenship,\u201d albeit in a form that sounds less objectionable to hardline immigration restrictionists. Perhaps that bit of language trickery offers a small sign that the thinking in the White House is evolving.\n\nWhat is less encouraging about the Axios report is its portrayal of Kushner. He seems unaware that the solution he\u2019s considering as if it were novel is the same one that his father-in-law has already rejected multiple times.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-chuck-schumer-snl-trump_n_5c68f7e7e4b05c889d1fef6e": "The Senate minority leader and House speaker could barely keep it together as they reviewed the deal that, as Update co-anchor Colin Jost noted, gave Trump just the merest fraction of the money he sought.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-sanctions-oleg-deripaska_us_5c3df29ee4b0e0baf54142d7": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The Senate on Tuesday voted to advance a resolution that would reverse the Trump administration\u2019s decision to relax sanctions on three Russian companies linked to oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEleven Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the resolution in a 57-42 vote \u2015 a major rebuke of Trump administration officials who mounted a last-minute lobbying effort led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to table the measure.\n\nBut while the resolution advanced on Tuesday with a simple majority vote, it will require 60 votes to proceed to final passage \u2015 a much tougher bar to clear. And even if it somehow reaches Trump\u2019s desk, the president would likely veto it.\n\nThe Treasury Department announced last month its plan to lift sanctions imposed on the core businesses of aluminum magnate Deripaska, including EN+, Rusal and energy firm JSC EuroSibEnergo. Administration officials argued that Deripaska sufficiently divested control of the firms and that as a result, the firms are no longer in violation of sanctions law.\n\nMnuchin also framed the issue as a matter of global trade in a meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, arguing that not lifting the sanctions on the Deripaska-linked aluminum producing companies would benefit other aluminum producers like China.\n\nBut Democrats and even some Republicans expressed skepticism about the Trump administration\u2019s ability to enforce the agreement they reached with the companies to limit Deripaska\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cI could make a very compelling argument I think that he would have control remain,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Tuesday of Deripaska.\n\nAsked why he joined Democrats in supporting the resolution on Tuesday, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), meanwhile, said he did so because Deripaska is \u201ca gangster.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also expressed concern about Deripaska\u2019s deep ties with Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who was convicted of financial crimes as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties with Russia.\n\n\u201cGiven Mr. Deripaska\u2019s potential involvement with Paul Manafort and the fact that the Special Counsel\u2019s Russia investigation has not yet concluded its work, it\u2019s all the more reason these sanctions must remain in place,\u201d Schumer said in a statement, adding later that removing the sanctions would amount to a \u201cfavor\u201d to Putin.\n\nSchumer was able to force a vote on the matter under the 2017 Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which allowed the Democratic leader to bring a privileged resolution of disapproval of the easing of sanctions to the floor for a vote in the Senate. Under the law, the resolution must be passed by both the House and Senate by Jan. 17, 2019.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 effort to block the Trump administration from easing sanctions on Deripaska comes amid increasing concern about President Donald Trump\u2019s behavior toward Russia and habit of being friendly with its president Putin.\n\nTrump on Monday denied having ever worked for the Russian government after a report published last week indicated the FBI opened an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been an agent of the Kremlin. Another report detailing how Trump has \u201cgone to extraordinary lengths\u201d to hide his interactions with the Russian president, including in one instance taking possession of meeting notes from his own interpreter after a meeting with the Russian leader, prompted concern from some Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s inappropriate for the president ... to communicate with the president of another global power without having people there keeping careful records. ... That is an enormous mistake and should not be repeated,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said in an interview with CNN.\n\nBut Romney, who once called Russia the U.S.\u2019s biggest geopolitical foe, on Tuesday declined to support the resolution seeking to overturn sanctions on Russian firms owned by a top ally to Putin.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-justin-fairfax-resignation_us_5c5e35ece4b0eec79b236fb9": "Top Democrats representing states across the country called on Virginia Lt.

So here\u2019s your guide to what\u2019s happening with the Mueller probe and what comes next.\n\nAll right, so this is all about Russian interference in the 2016 election. What have we learned about that?\n\nA decent amount so far, but we don\u2019t yet have the full picture. Much of the media coverage of the Mueller investigation has focused on the Americans in Trump\u2019s orbit who have been caught up in the probe. But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media.\n\nOne reason those cases don\u2019t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there\u2019s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they\u2019re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments \u2014 one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 \u2014 are essential parts of the Mueller probe.\n\nThe first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system\u201d and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals \u2015 most of them military intelligence officers \u2015 \u201cconducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public.\n\nOK, other than all those Russians, who in Trump\u2019s circle has Mueller indicted?\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone.\n\nThere were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don\u2019t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn\u2019t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon.\n\nWho has the Mueller investigation found committed crimes?\n\nThe special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates.\n\nManafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial.\n\nIs anyone going to prison?\n\nPapadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat about Paul Manafort?\n\nManafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time.\n\nAfter he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller\u2019s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews \u2015 committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI.\n\nHow long has this Mueller probe been going on?\n\nMueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them \u2015 named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhen is the Mueller report coming out?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it\u2019s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It\u2019s unclear what form that would take.\n\nWhat kind of operation is Mueller running?\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty tight ship. There haven\u2019t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves).\n\nHow has Trump\u2019s legal team responded?\n\nBy getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI \u2015 generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization \u2015 was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau\u2019s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton\u2019s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election.\n\nAfter the Mueller probe wraps up, is that it?\n\nNo. There have been some clear signs that Mueller\u2019s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren\u2019t on Mueller\u2019s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it\u2019s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney\u2019s office without setting off a bunch of alarms.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump\u2019s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August.\n\nSo that\u2019s how Jeff Bezos\u2019 dick pics fit into all this?\n\nRight. The Enquirer published Bezos\u2019 intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos \u2014 the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn\u2019t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There\u2019s a question whether what he calls \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d violates AMI\u2019s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let\u2019s say, a complexifier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in everything?\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2015 based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public.\n\nRosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He\u2019s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed.\n\nWho is Matt Whitaker, and how the heck did he become Rosenstein\u2019s boss?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn\u2019t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush\u2019s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe.\n\nWhere does WikiLeaks fit in?\n\nA key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails\u2019 release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election.\n\nSome of the special counsel\u2019s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone.\n\nSo what is Roger Stone charged with, exactly?\n\nMueller\u2019s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel\u2019s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering.\n\nThe indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury \u2014 referring to a scene in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to \u2014 and threatened Credico\u2019s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIs there anyone else implicated in the Roger Stone indictment?\n\nThere\u2019s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted.\n\nDraft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year.\n\n\n\nGuess we should talk more about Michael Cohen\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress.\n\nHis indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization\u2019s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted.\n\nCohen told investigators that at Trump\u2019s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nWhat ended up happening with the Moscow Trump Tower?\n\nIt never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen\u2019s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with that secret Supreme Court battle?\n\nThis one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business \u2015 called \u201cCorporation\u201d from \u201cCountry A\u201d in court filings \u2015 trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the \u201cCorporation\u201d has to comply with the subpoena, but didn\u2019t explain its decision.\n\nAll this mystery could amount to nothing \u2015 it\u2019s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation.\n\nDoes it matter that the Democrats now control the House?\n\nIt does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe.

However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion.

The Republican-controlled state Senate has agreed to give school employees another raise, but only with some major strings attached. These include the creation of charter schools in the state and a new voucher-like system that would steer public money to private schools.\n\nThe education omnibus bill that cleared the chamber by an 18-16 margin on Monday includes a number of conservative proposals that GOP legislators have put forth in the past. But now lawmakers have coupled them with much of what educators fought for last year, and teacher representatives say the legislation would ultimately divert money away from public schools.\n\n\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s retaliation for what we did last spring,\u201d said Fred Albert, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, one of the state\u2019s two main teachers unions.\n\nThose unions and the union representing school support staff have asked their local affiliates to hold votes on whether to green-light walkouts or other protests in response to the legislation. Workers are casting ballots by Friday.\n\nUnion leaders suspect the vast majority of their members will approve of walking off the job in the event the most controversial measures appear likely to become law. No date for a walkout has been set.\n\nThe education package passed in the Senate headed Tuesday to the House, which also has a Republican majority. But House members serve shorter terms \u2015 two years, as opposed to four \u2015 and may be more amenable to pressure from teachers and other school employees in their districts.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the bill that passed the Senate will not survive in the same form. Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has already said he would veto it if it did.\n\nEven so, Kym Randolph, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Education Association, said they consider the package a serious threat, noting that it only takes a simple majority in each legislative chamber to override a governor\u2019s veto.\n\nRandolph said teachers want to avoid something as drastic as a walkout, but feel \u201cincensed\u201d by the omnibus bill and the way it was fast-tracked through the upper chamber. As reported by The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported, Senate leaders used an arcane procedural maneuver to bypass a review of the legislation by a finance committee once it became obvious there weren\u2019t enough votes for it to clear that panel.\n\nDave Jamieson/HuffPost\n\nTeachers have \u201cwatched the actions of the Senate, and it\u2019s like the matador with the red cape,\u201d she said. The teachers \u201cwent back to work and now the Senate has gone this route. It\u2019s kind of disrupting the whole process again.\u201d\n\nThe most controversial aspects of the legislative plan would establish a public charter system and create \u201deducation savings accounts.\u201d The latter would grant families around $3,200 a year in public money to put toward a child\u2019s private school costs, tutoring or online education, so long as the child is not a full-time public school student. The number of accounts statewide would be capped at 2,500, to be made eligible on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nLike with other charter or voucher proposals, many teachers and their unions in West Virginia worry the plan would siphon much-needed money out of public schools over time. The West Virginia Schools Athletic Coaches Association came out strongly against the bill, arguing that it would lead to \u201cchaos\u201d in sports and prompt transfers.\n\nA report by The Beckley Register-Herald illustrated one of the biggest concerns: that wealthier and more stable families would be best positioned to take advantage of the charters and savings accounts, leaving poor children behind in lower-performing schools. The Gazette-Mail reported that at least seven of 18 senators who advanced the bill had children who did not go to public schools.\n\nThe groundbreaking walkout that began late last February was meant to reverse years of lackluster investment in the public school system. Like many other states, West Virginia saw a steep drop in revenue in the wake of the Great Recession, a problem exacerbated by years of tax cuts. That left the state with little money to give to teachers, who went years without meaningful raises. Their higher health care costs meant take-home pay was effectively going down for many.\n\nThe state has no collective bargaining for teachers and other school employees; the unions basically function as lobbies, with pay scales set by the state legislature. Last year\u2019s nine-day walkout, which was illegal under state law, forced lawmakers to agree to a five percent raise for public employees, as well as develop a plan to fund the state health insurance plan. The success of the walkout helped spur similar ones in Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona.\n\nAlbert, of AFT-West Virginia, said the fast-moving education bill made it clear the fight was far from over. He said the legislature should pass a stand-alone bill assuring raises for educators, leaving out the controversial measures that the state Senate added. If not, he said, schools could end up closed again, with teachers flooding the capitol.\n\n\u201cThey feel, like I do, that this bill has harmful things in there and it seems like payback,\u201d Albert said. \u201cThey\u2019re still inspired to carry on what they did last year.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neomi-rao-date-rape-trump-judge_us_5c59d8d5e4b09293b208c671": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Neomi Rao, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to a lifetime seat on the D.C.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asked Rao to explain her argument, in her 1993 piece, that \u201cdate rape exemplifies the attempts of the nurture feminist to develop an artificial, alternative world in which women are free from sexual danger and no always means no.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your current view, when does no not mean no?\u201d asked Harris.\n\n\u201cSenator, no means no,\u201d said Rao. \u201cI regret writing that when I was in college.\u201d\n\nHarris pressed Rao on her other claims that a good way for a woman to avoid being date raped is \u201cto stay reasonably sober,\u201d and that if a woman drinks too much to where she can no longer choose whether to have sex, \u201cgetting to that point was her choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, I was only trying to make the commonsense observation about the relationship between drinking and becoming a victim,\u201d said Rao.\n\n\u201cDo you stand by those comments?\u201d interjected Harris.\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d Rao replied. \u201cI would not express myself that way today.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\" Neomi Rao in a 1994 issue of The Yale Herald\n\nDespite Rao expressing regrets, Sen.

And it is unquestionably true that any student that drinks to the points of getting drunk and losing control risks being a victim, risks being vulnerable.\u201d\n\nRao largely ignored questions about whether she would recuse herself from cases that are related to her current job as the administrator of the Office of Informational and Regulatory Affairs. The agency is a division of the Office of Management and Budget that evaluates federal government regulations, and in her role here, Rao has helped the Trump administration weaken policies relating to clean power plants, sexual assault regulations and race discrimination in housing.

He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers \u2014 including his own Secret Service detail \u2014 began their second month without a paycheck.\n\nNow, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nOne former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way he gets it done,\u201d said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump. \u201cAnd screw Puerto Rico,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cPuerto Rico doesn\u2019t have electoral votes last time I checked.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.\n\nWhile Trump has the authority to declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill \u2014 a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.\n\nOne of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. \u201cI would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,\u201d he said of the possible emergency declaration. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad law and I think it\u2019s bad strategy for the president.\u201d\n\nKeeping The Public Scared\n\nTrump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an \u201cemergency\u201d that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trump\u2019s own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.\n\nMigrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201cvery bad people.\u201d\n\nWhen the November election passed, so did Trump\u2019s interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up \u201ccaravans\u201d until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.\n\nTrump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last month\u2019s shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native \u2014 also white \u2014 has been charged in those slayings.\n\n\u201cHe continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. That\u2019s his MO. It\u2019s not new,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201cUnfortunately, it works, among some people. But it\u2019s really cynical politics.\u201d\n\nTriggering A National Emergency\n\nCynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.\n\nTrump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2015 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities,\u201d Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. \u201cNow, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.\u201d\n\nThat brought a rebuke from the city\u2019s mayor the next day. \u201cWe are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,\u201d Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC. \u201cI talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But we\u2019ve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation.\u201d\n\nPrimarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.\n\nWhile Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nDoing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a \u201cjoint resolution\u201d of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans \u2014 and could possibly lose a good deal more.\n\nSome Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m urging the president to tread carefully,\u201d said Texas Republican John Cornyn.\n\nSusan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach. \u201cI think I\u2019ve expressed serious concern about going down that path but let\u2019s wait and see what the president does before we decide,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d he told reporters late last week. \u201cWe will be looking at a national emergency, because I don\u2019t think anything is going to happen. I think the Democrats don\u2019t want border security.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/utah-voters-approved-medicaid-expansion-at-the-ballot-box-the-gop-is-trying-to-undo-it_us_5c535403e4b01d3c1f11a46d": "On Election Day, a majority of Utah voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid coverage to an estimated 150,000 low-income adults. The Republican-led state Legislature has other ideas.\n\nThe Utah Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would toss out a grassroots-driven, voter-backed ballot initiative to offer Medicaid benefits to any Utahn earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000 a year for a single person), paid for by raising the sales tax on certain goods from 4.7 percent to 4.85 percent.\n\nThe legislation instead would expand Medicaid to fewer people, enable Utah to receive less federal money for the program and impose limitations on benefits, including work requirements. And the entire plan hinges on a dubious promise of federal approval for aspects of the state Senate bill.\n\nThe Utah GOP clearly is prioritizing overturning the voters, considering the Legislature has been in session since just Monday and the bill made it out its Senate committee Tuesday and to the floor Wednesday. The fact that 53 percent of voters spoke in favor of a full Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in November is not swaying Utah Republican legislators, who have resisted the expansion since it became available in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative, known as Proposition 3, not only received majority support statewide but also in most state Senate districts, the Utah Health Policy Project reported. According to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis of the vote Wednesday, 10 Republican senators representing districts where a majority voted in favor of the expansion are supporting the bill to modify it, including the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Allen Christensen. A plurality of Utahns opposes changing the voter-backed policy, according to a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defer to the will of the people at some point,\u201d said state Rep. Brian King, the minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives and one of 16 Democrats in the 75-member lower chamber of the Utah State Legislature. \u201cWe should not be doing anything to substantively alter that Proposition 3 in a way that delays the implementation one more day.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill sends a message to voters, King said: \u201cWe don\u2019t really care what the people of the state of Utah want to do or say they want us to do at the Legislature. We\u2019re going to do what we want to do. That\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d\n\nThese actions by Utah Republican lawmakers are reminiscent of how then-Gov. Paul LePage (R) defied Maine voters last year by refusing to carry out a Medicaid expansion they approved in 2017. LePage\u2019s successor, Gov. Janet Mills (D), has already begun the process of implementing the expansion. In Idaho, where voters also passed a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, a conservative organization is challenging it before the state Supreme Court.\n\nEfforts by Republicans at the state level to undo or limit the Medicaid expansion, including the seven states that received federal approval for work requirements and the eight more seeking it, mirror the national Republican strategy on health care.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress devoted most of 2017 to attempting and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with plans that would have left millions without health coverage. And in December, a federal judge ruled in favor of 20 GOP state officials who argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in a lawsuit supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nRick Bowmer/Associated Press Tiffiny Malo, left, and Pam Harrison, supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid, at a rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law during the first day of the Utah Legislature on Monday.\n\nThe Utah Senate must vote again on the bill to significantly alter the Medicaid expansion enacted by voters, which it approved once this week against the opposition of all six Democratic senators and one of the chamber\u2019s 23 Republicans. The state House is poised to act quickly on the legislation after the Senate is finished.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving very quickly,\u201d said King, who expects the Utah House will pass the Senate bill by the end of next week.\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert has not taken a public position on the Medicaid bill. In response to questions from HuffPost, Herbert\u2019s office provided a statement from a spokesman.\n\n\u201cGov. Herbert has long supported the kind of common-sense guardrails for Medicaid expansion that are being discussed in the legislature. Many were components of his proposed Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion in 2015; most of these were part of legislation that he signed into law last general session. His primary concerns are that the state honor the will of the voters to fill the hole in the social safety net by helping those under the poverty line without health insurance and to implement without delay,\u201d Paul Edwards said in the statement.\n\nLast week, Herbert said he believed the state should allow the expansion to move forward as approved by voters and then be revisited at a later date. During his State of the State address Thursday, Herbert said only that \u201cthe much-needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay.\u201d\n\nBecause Republicans have supermajorities in the Utah House and Senate, however, the GOP would have the votes to override a veto even if Herbert decided to oppose the Medicaid legislation.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and the federal government finances at least 90 percent of the cost. This expansion was meant to be in place nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate. To date, 14 states have declined it. Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voters all approved expansion via ballot initiative last year, but the program is not yet in place in those states. Under the terms of the Utah initiative, benefits are supposed to become available April 1.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative was straightforward in its approach by simply instructing the state to join the Medicaid expansion without any changes to the state\u2019s existing program or the need for federal approval. The Utah Governor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget assessed that the sales tax increase would raise more than enough money to finance the state\u2019s 10 percent share of the expansion\u2019s cost, although it noted that the revenue and costs in future years may not match up.\n\nBy contrast, the Utah Senate bill would trigger a complicated and uncertain process that would cover fewer people under Medicaid. The Senate began action on the measure before the Legislature\u2019s budget scorekeepers could analyze the legislation\u2019s effects, but it is designed to limit the Medicaid expansion\u2019s reach. That\u2019s despite the fact that the measure would leave the sales tax increase in place while also imposing a tax on hospitals that alone is intended to be large enough to cover the state\u2019s entire share of the expense of Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder the Senate legislation, Medicaid benefits would be available only to those with incomes below the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person. Utahns with incomes higher than that would continue to have access to subsidized private coverage via the health insurance exchange in the state. Unlike the Medicaid expansion voters approved, the state would receive about 70 percent of the funding for the partial Medicaid expansion from the federal government instead of the 90 percent offered by a full expansion.\n\nThe bill lacks detail on many key elements of the modified expansion, leaving those to the state\u2019s executive branch and federal officials to hash out. In order to maintain April 1 as the day benefits would come online, legislative Republicans are counting on all of that happening on an extraordinarily expedited basis.\n\n\u201cThis entire thing is being rammed through the Senate and the House as quickly as possible. It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters, that they\u2019re disrespecting voters by doing so,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a Washington-based organization that supported Medicaid ballot initiatives in Utah, Idaho, Maine, Montana and Nebraska over the past two years.\n\nIt is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project\n\nThe Herbert administration would have to resolve all the outstanding questions the bill poses and the federal government would have to approve waivers for standard Medicaid rules in less than two months, which is much more quickly than it typically acts.\n\n\u201cNothing about how the federal government moves and operates gives me much hope or assurance that you\u2019re going to get a waiver at all, much less one in a time frame that is going to be less than 60 days,\u201d King said.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty pertains to the funding. Under the legislation, Utah would ask the federal government to break precedent by providing the full 90 percent funding for a partial expansion. The Trump administration last year rejected such requests from Arkansas and Massachusetts, following the Obama administration\u2019s policy against partial expansions.\n\nUtah has even tried this before. Herbert signed legislation last year approving a partial expansion and submitted a request for approval to federal authorities. That would have covered about half as many people as a full Medicaid expansion. The state withdrew its application after the ballot initiative passed.\n\nThe new bill also calls for work requirements and for locking out enrollees who fail to meet them, but it does not specify what they would be and how they would be enforced. It also would cap enrollment for otherwise eligible Utahns if cost projections for the expansion exceed the amount of money appropriated for the year.\n\nThe attempt to overturn voters on Medicaid expansion comes a month after Herbert signed legislation to replace a medical marijuana initiative voters approved last year with a new law. In the aftermath of voters passing the marijuana and Medicaid measures, Utah lawmakers also are eying changes to the ballot initiative process to let the Legislature alter voter-backed policies before they take effect.\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from a spokesman for Utah Gov.

Others said she would task them with her personal errands, such as washing dishes at her home, which violates Senate ethics rules.\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s mistreatment of staff caused then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to privately reprimand her in 2015, HuffPost reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nReid does not recall if this encounter occurred, a spokesperson said.

Instead, he described the inquiry as an ongoing process of information-sharing between state and county officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following state law and federal law in this procedure,\u201d Whitley said, speaking at a confirmation hearing before a Texas Senate committee.\n\nBut under questioning from Democratic lawmakers, Whitley struggled to explain why, in a press release two weeks ago, his office said 95,000 noncitizens could be on the voter rolls even though that data hadn\u2019t been verified with local election officials. Whitley said he issued the press release because his office does not have investigative authority and he wanted to quickly get the data to officials who could act on it.\n\n\u201cI was confident it was the best data,\u201d Whitley said of the information he received from state officials, adding that he had received assurances it was accurate. Whitley said he did not personally review the data before it was sent out.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) is facing scrutiny over a review of suspected noncitizen voters in Texas.\n\nCounty officials are investigating the list of suspected noncitizens and have already identified substantial errors \u2015 at least 20,000 people have been removed from the list. The county officials say the secretary of state\u2019s office contacted them shortly after sending out the list and informed them the data they\u2019d sent included several people whom the state had already verified as citizens.\n\nLocal officials believe the list of suspected noncitizens may continue to shrink with more investigating, and some have said the unsubstantiated public statements about voter fraud from Whitley and state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) have undermined confidence in elections.\n\nCivil rights groups accused Whitley and Paxton of prematurely sending out unverified data and stirring up fears of voter fraud. County officials can now use that data to request that voters prove their citizenship within 30 days or be removed from the rolls. The groups say the process discriminates against naturalized citizens because the Texas Department of Public Safety does not keep updated citizenship records.\n\nSophia Lin Lakin, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project who is representing plaintiffs suing Whitley over the review, said Whitley\u2019s quick action on the list of suspected noncitizens was reckless.\n\n\u201cSecretary Whitley\u2019s irresponsible decision to forward his purge list to law enforcement authorities knowing that it very likely contained the names of naturalized citizens properly on the rolls is just another indication of the apparent disregard for the immigrant community in Texas that prompted him to initiate a purge program that by its nature threatens the voting rights of naturalized citizens,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitley refused to say his office had made mistakes in the data it sent to state officials. Instead, he said the process of verifying voters\u2019 citizenship was meant to be \u201ccollaborative,\u201d and that his office had always intended for local officials to verify the data. He said his office conducted 10 training sessions before sending out the data, and that they\u2019d warned election officials the data was likely to contain errors.\n\nTexas state Sen. Jos\u00e9 Men\u00e9ndez (D) asked how the data could be accurate if it didn\u2019t contain up-to-date citizenship records.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have the naturalization data, maybe it\u2019s not the best data in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitley said he consulted with Abbott\u2019s office and Paxton\u2019s office before issuing the Jan. 25 press release. One of three federal lawsuits filed over the last two weeks to halt the voter inquiry accuses the three officials of conspiring to suppress the voting rights of people of color.\n\nDuring one remarkable exchange with state Sen. Royce West (D), Whitley repeatedly declined to define the term \u201cvoter suppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, I have heard voter suppression talked about,\u201d Whitley said. When West pressed him to define the term, Whitley said his definition was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d He added that anecdotally, he believed it referred to acts that discourage people from voting.\n\nAnecdotally, I have heard voter suppression talked about. Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R)\n\nWhitley\u2019s comments are significant because federal judges have indeed found that Texas lawmakers intentionally discriminated against voters of color \u2015 both through a voter ID law passed in 2013 and via boundaries for electoral districts. (Appeals courts have subsequently upheld revised versions of those measures.) Plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit say Texas\u2019 intentional discrimination is so pronounced that moving forward, the state should have to clear its voting changes with the federal government.\n\n\u201cSecretary Whitley\u2019s testimony today only deepened our concerns regarding the flawed and inaccurate voter purge list that his office sent to counties two weeks ago,\u201d Beth Stevens, voting rights legal director at the Texas Civil Rights Project \u2015 which is also suing Whitley \u2015 said Thursday. \u201cInstead of taking full responsibility for this debacle, he passed the buck to the previous Secretary and the Department of Public Safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost alarming for voters,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cthe Secretary admitted that he sent this list of individuals to county officials and the Attorney General before knowing all of the facts to determine voter eligibility.\u201d\n\nState Sen. John Whitmire (D) appeared briefly at Thursday\u2019s hearing to register his opposition to Whitley\u2019s voter probe, noting that the list targeted an intern in his office. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Whitmire said.\n\nThe experience of Whitmire\u2019s intern, Bel\u00e9n I\u00f1iguez, underscores some of the problems critics pointed out at the hearing. She moved to Austin from the town of Tyler to work at this year\u2019s legislative session.\n\nHaving naturalized last year, I\u00f1iguez feared she might be on the secretary of state\u2019s list of suspected noncitizen voters. A call to Smith County election officials confirmed she was.\n\nBut the letter giving her 30 days to prove her citizenship or have her voter registration revoked went out Jan. 31 to her old address in Tyler, where she never would have received it.\n\n\u201cThere was no freaking way for me to find out that I was on that list other than calling,\u201d I\u00f1iguez told HuffPost.\n\nDespite the concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers, the Republican-majority nominations committee is likely to approve Whitley\u2019s nomination.

The surprise change in policy led to the resignation of several top officials, including former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, as well as vocal opposition from some of the president\u2019s biggest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhile Trump ultimately decided to delay the pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria for several months to ensure a slow and orderly withdrawal, the move failed to quell concern from top Republicans in Congress.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) introduced an amendment last week that expressed the sense of the chamber that the U.S. \u201cfaces continuing threats from terrorist groups operating in Syria and Afghanistan\u201d and that the \u201cprecipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.\u201d\n\nIt passed on Monday by a 70-26 vote with the help of a big bipartisan majority. Democratic Sens.

Many of those senators have approached Trump\u2019s foreign policy with caution, expressing criticism dealing with stylistic rather than substantive matters.\n\nWhile the amendment is a nonbinding provision without the force of law, it sent a clear message to the White House that any plans to immediately pull troops out of war zones could jeopardize the fight against groups like the so-called Islamic State, leave Kurdish allies on the ground defenseless, and embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran.\n\nSenate Republicans seldom buck Trump on anything, but they have become increasingly agitated lately over his administration\u2019s foreign policy.

But some of House\u2019s Senate colleagues were surprised to learn of his departure, given that he did not have a high-profile job lined up and that Democrats could regain control of the Senate in 2020.\n\nHouse\u2019s departure, however, was not voluntary.

Democrats on the Judiciary committee are expected to pounce.\n\nRao, 45, currently runs the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. She\u2019s never been a judge, but she is on Trump\u2019s shortlist of Supreme Court nominees. An attorney, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office under President George W.

Beyond that, in her role at OIRA, a division of the Office of Management and Budget that evaluates federal government regulations, she has helped the Trump administration weaken policies on all of those fronts.\n\nHer past writings on sexual assault perhaps stand out the most in her bid for a lifetime federal court seat.\n\nIn a 1994 op-ed in The Yale Herald, titled \u201cShades of Gray,\u201d Rao argued that \u201ca woman, like a man, decides when and how much to drink. And if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.\u201d She wrote that \u201ca good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\u201d\n\nIn an April 1993 piece in the Yale Free Press, titled \u201cThe Feminist Dilemma,\u201d Rao argued that the \u201ccontroversy\u201d over sexual assault and date rape \u201chas been painted in terms of \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019, reducing sex to something merely consensual.\u201d She said \u201cnon-verbal communication plays an undeniable role,\u201d and though she is \u201cnot arguing that date rape victims ask for it, when playing the modern dating game women have to understand and accept the consequences of their sexuality.\u201d\n\nRao\u2019s record at OIRA isn\u2019t great on policies affecting sexual assault, either.\n\nSince November 2017, she\u2019s stalled proposed guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to give employers more information on how to handle sexual misconduct. And under her leadership, OIRA signed off on a proposed rule change by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that would narrow the definition of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses and strengthen the rights of the accused.\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters Neomi Rao reacts to President Donald Trump announcing that she is his choice for filling Brett Kavanaugh's former seat on the D.C.

But it\u2019s also because so many of Rao\u2019s past writings on issues like race, sexuality and science are ripe for scrutiny.\n\nShe wrote in February 1995 that \u201cYale has dedicated itself to a relatively firm meritocracy, which drops its standards only for a few minorities, some legacies and a football player here or there.\u201d When she was a junior at Yale, she wrote another article titled \u201dSeparate but More Than Equal,\u201d in which she denounced \u201cspecial treatment for minority students\u201d and suggested that students of color have an unfair advantage by having \u201cethnic deans\u201d devoted to assisting them.\n\nShe wrote in November 1994 that the push for LGBTQ rights was a \u201ctrendy political movement.\u201d She warned in July 1994 that \u201cmulticulturalists are trying to \u201cundermine American culture.\u201d\n\nIn April 1992, Rao wrote that \u201cthe greenhouse effect, the depleting ozone layer, and the dangers of acid rain\u201d are \u201cthree major environmental bogeymen.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s affected policies on all of these fronts at OIRA. Under her leadership, the agency has reviewed and is in the process of working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to roll back protections against housing discrimination based on race. She approved a proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, a public protection program that reduced greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. OIRA is also finalizing a new policy proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow health care providers to refuse to provide care to patients on the grounds of \u201cconscientious objections,\u201d as in LGBTQ patients or women seeking reproductive care.\n\nIf confirmed, Rao would be the second Indian-American after Sri Srinivasan to land a seat on the D.C.

In seeking to lift the sanctions, top Trump administration officials argued that Deripaska had sufficiently divested control of the firms and that keeping the penalties in place for Deripaska-linked aluminum producing companies would benefit other aluminum companies based in China and elsewhere.\n\nBut even some Republicans who usually support President Donald Trump and his agenda didn\u2019t buy the argument that Deripaska still wouldn\u2019t in some way control the companies from which he divested his interests.\n\n\u201cMaybe that would work in America but in Russia, there are other ways of owning a corporation than just giving up shares,\u201d Sen.

Wade 46 years ago to allow abortion, thus protecting it in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned in the future, something which Democrats fear could occur under a conservative-led Supreme Court.\n\nIn a press release, Cuomo emphasized that concern as a sign of the legislation\u2019s importance.\n\n\u201cToday we are taking a giant step forward in the hard-fought battle to ensure a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her own personal health, including the ability to access an abortion,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWith the signing of this bill, we are sending a clear message that whatever happens in Washington, women in New York will always have the fundamental right to control their own body.\u201d\n\nAside from keeping abortions available, the law removes the procedure from the state\u2019s criminal code, which had previously made it illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother\u2019s life was in jeopardy.\n\nNow, that option is allowed after that point if the mother\u2019s life or health is at stake or if her fetus is not viable.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins praised the move as an indication of progress for women.\n\n\u201cNew York once led the way on choice and women\u2019s rights,\u201d Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cUnfortunately for years, barriers to women\u2019s rights were put up, and our state has fallen behind.

Lisa Murkowski.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 They opposed confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. They voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act. They voted against confirming Betsy DeVos to be the secretary of education.\n\nThis describes virtually every Senate Democrat (except for West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who voted for Kavanaugh) on some of the most consequential votes taken since Donald Trump became president.\n\nIt also describes one Republican: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nFor the past two years, Murkowski has bucked her party when it often mattered the most. Her vote against Obamacare repeal was arguably her boldest; she resisted intense GOP lobbying and public criticism from Trump to join two other Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and the late John McCain of Arizona, to torpedo her party\u2019s priority issue.\n\nHer vote against DeVos meant Vice President Mike Pence had to come to the Senate to break a tie. And her opposition to Kavanaugh was as significant as it was dramatic. The outcome was going to be close, and nobody knew what Murkowski planned to do \u2015 including her staff \u2015 until the Senate held a procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. When her name was called, Murkowski stood up at her desk, looked dead ahead and said in a barely audible voice, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n(She ended up voting \u201cpresent\u201d on the final vote for an arcane procedural reason; the Congressional Record reflects her position was a \u201cno\u201d on the nomination.)\n\nTrump tore into Murkowski after that vote, warning that she \u201cwill never recover\u201d politically. The Alaska GOP considered reprimanding her, as well as withdrawing its support for her and requesting that she not seek re-election in 2022 as a Republican.\n\nMonths after the furor, tucked away in a Capitol Hill office decorated with maps, Native Alaskan art and fish mounted on the walls, she says she has no regrets.\n\n\u201cAlmost without exception, I hear \u2018thanks\u2019 from people, whether they\u2019re Alaskans or strangers you\u2019re passing in an airport somewhere,\u201d she said in a Monday interview. \u201cSome thank me for not voting for (Kavanaugh).

But that\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cI still believe that it was the right vote for me, and if I had to do it all over again, it would be the same vote,\u201d she said. \u201cI have moved on, and I think most Alaskans have as well.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the Republican senator largely votes with her party. She\u2019s voted to confirm all of Trump\u2019s lifetime federal judges beyond Kavanaugh, even though she\u2019s pro-choice and many of Trump\u2019s court picks strongly oppose abortion rights. She voted for the GOP tax bill that gives the richest 1 percent of Americans 82 percent of its benefits over time.\n\nBut sitting in front of a monstrously large, wall-mounted Alaska king salmon that she caught herself \u2015 his name is \u201cWalter\u201d and he weighed 63 pounds when he was alive, rest his soul \u2015 Murkowski seemed incredibly at ease with her reputation for acting more independently than her GOP colleagues. It makes her a rare breed in a Congress that\u2019s become so politically polarized that it struggles just to keep the government open.\n\nStrategically, Murkowski\u2019s position makes sense, considering the Alaskans who actually get her elected. Despite representing a red state, her base is not conservative Republicans, but a cobbled-together mix of moderate Republicans, Democrats and independents. And she\u2019s kept them with her for the better part of 16 years (she was initially appointed to her Senate seat in December 2002).\n\n\u201cOut of 100 members in the Senate, she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s really wearing the balls right now,\u201d Carroll Knutson, a 74-year-old Republican resident of Soldotna, Alaska, told HuffPost during a reporting trip to the state in 2017, right after her vote against Obamacare repeal. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can put that in your story.\u201d\n\nJen Bendery Here's a framed photo in Murkowski's office of the senator holding \"Walter\" right after she caught him.\n\nFor all the grief she\u2019s taken when she\u2019s defied her party, it would make sense if Murkowski has at least considered leaving it and rebranding herself as an independent. It would make even more sense given the way her party treated her in 2010, when it initially appeared her re-election bid was derailed after she unexpectedly lost the GOP primary to a tea party challenger.\n\nStunned, she responded by launching a write-in campaign featuring now-famous ads that carefully spelled out her name, M-U-R-K-O-W-S-K-I. Against the odds, and with no support from the Republican Party, she won.\n\nMurkowski, 61, chuckled when asked if it sounded appealing to ditch her party. She said the reality is there are only two parties in Congress \u2015 the Senate\u2019s two independents caucus with Democrats \u2015 and she has no interest in joining Democrats.\n\n\u201cI have looked at my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and I say, as many issues as I have with some of the Republican things, you guys have a lot more problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I maintain the deliberation and the thought and the consideration for each issue that comes before me, and vote in a manner that I think is best for the people I work for, I think that\u2019s what is more important.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/venezuela-juan-guaido-donald-trump-2020-democrats_us_5c520bd0e4b04f8645c745f4": "Caitlin Ochs / Reuters Sen.

Trump has advocated for a military invasion of the oil-rich South American country in the past, but Venezuela experts questioned this policy tactic and viewed that scenario as unlikely.

He has emphasized his control of the military.\n\nA spokesman for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is reportedly considering a run, declined to comment.\n\nThe campaigns or exploratory committees of Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro did not respond to inquiries about the candidates\u2019 stances on Venezuela.\n\n\u2018We all think the dictator must go.\u2019\n\nMaduro was elected in 2013, after the death of socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who survived a coup attempt that was possibly linked to the Bush administration in 2002. Since he came to power, Maduro has faced internal and international opposition over his authoritarian crackdowns on political dissent, and resistance to his presidency has intensified amid an economic crisis spurred by global declines in oil prices.\n\nMaduro was a subject of debate within the Obama administration, as it weighed whether to sanction the president and top Venezuelan government officials amid allegations of human rights abuses. Obama sanctioned seven Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in 2015, a decision that drew rebukes across Latin America.\n\nThe situation has continued to deteriorate since, and an estimated 3 million refugees and migrants have left the country amid economic turmoil, including spiraling inflation and food and medicine shortages. Maduro won a second term in May 2018, after an election marred by official boycotts from opposition parties and claims that the president had acted to rig the results in his favor. The opposition parties declared the results illegitimate and were joined by the United States, European Union, and several large, influential Latin American democracies.\n\nMaduro has clung to power since Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the legitimate leader on Jan. 23 amid widespread protests both in support of and against the government. Leaning on the support of the armed forces, Maduro opened the door to dialogue with the opposition and Guaid\u00f3 as protests erupted again on Wednesday. But there is no guarantee that the dispute will lead to new elections or come to an immediate resolution, even as the Trump administration has said it will use any means available to remove Maduro from office.\n\nWe cannot control the outcomes [in foreign countries] no matter how much we wish to or thought we could in the 1990s.

Trump has called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) a \u201cclown.\u201d Just last week, Trump claimed in interviews that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposed border security and was OK with higher crime rates.\n\nTrump\u2019s calls for bipartisanship also did not prevent him from hitting a pair of his favorite themes.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d he said, referring to ongoing and coming probes into his relationship with Russia and his business dealings. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nTrump then referenced the elephant in the room: the recently ended and possibly returning government shutdown over his demand for a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,\u201d he said, setting up for his argument that U.S. taxpayers should spend many billions of dollars for his wall. \u201cIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall \u2015 but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump spoke about bipartisanship in Tuesday night's State of the Union address. But what will he say in the coming days?\n\nTrump, as is his custom, spent much of his speech boasting of accomplishments, including taking credit for things regardless of his actual role in them.\n\nHe said the strength of the economy and low unemployment was a result of his presidency: \u201cWe have launched an unprecedented economic boom \u2015 a boom that has rarely been seen before. There\u2019s been nothing like it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the economic trend lines have been relatively constant since the end of the financial crisis in 2009. Trump similarly claimed credit for the defeat of the self-declared Islamic State terror group, even though the strategy the military has used was developed under his predecessor, Barack Obama. He further took credit for a boom in U.S. energy production, even though that trend began under President George W. Bush and continued under Obama.\n\nIn other instances, he made claims that were flat-out false or appeared to be apocryphal, adding to a running total of 4,235 such falsehoods since he took office.\n\nIn the lengthy section of the speech devoted to illegal immigration, for example, Trump repeated a claim that kidnapped women and children are being smuggled into the country by \u201cthe thousands\u201d to be sold \u201cinto prostitution and modern-day slavery.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security has responded to numerous requests to provide details to support Trump\u2019s claims on the matter.\n\nAs most presidents before him, Trump promised a number of new proposals: an initiative to eliminate the spread of AIDS, an effort to reduce drug costs and another to fight childhood cancers.\n\nWhich, if any, of Trump\u2019s proposals advance at all beyond Tuesday night\u2019s speech is an open question. Trump\u2019s White House has been notoriously poor at following through on his professed initiatives.\n\nTrump promised a $1 trillion \u201cinfrastructure\u201d plan to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges in his 2017 joint address to Congress five weeks after taking office and $1.5 trillion in last year\u2019s State of the Union. No such plan ever materialized, and not a single dollar has been appropriated. (Trump again called for an infrastructure plan Tuesday night, but this time did not propose a dollar value.)\n\nAs far as reaching out to Democrats and other political critics, Trump has done that before in prepared remarks as well, only to undo it all within days or even hours with his unscripted remarks and tweets.\n\nIn 2017, after declaring that the \u201ctime for trivial fights is behind us,\u201d Trump within a few days had attacked Obama, the Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress, the FBI investigation into his ties to Russia and, inexplicably, the host who replaced him on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d television show.\n\nLast year, after calling on \u201call of us to set aside our differences,\u201d Trump a day and a half later attacked Democrats for having failed to support the tax cut legislation from months earlier and told audiences to replace them with more Republicans in the coming midterm elections.\n\nApart from Trump\u2019s inability or unwillingness to stick to a message, Tuesday\u2019s speech will also soon be overshadowed by an actual deadline with real consequences.\n\nA temporary spending bill Trump signed on Jan. 25 expires a week from Friday, making another shutdown of a quarter of the government an imminent possibility. Last time, Senate Republicans \u2015 who had already unanimously agreed to a short-term spending bill before Trump reneged on a commitment to sign it \u2015 stood with Trump.

He changed his tune at a press conference Saturday, denying that he was in the photo but admitting to wearing blackface another time. He also was widely mocked when he appeared to consider moonwalking for reporters.\n\nAfter that press conference, even the Democratic elected officials who had initially stuck by the governor began to abandon him.\n\nBut there are also high political stakes involved.\n\nDemocrats have a good chance of taking control of both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, where Republicans currently have narrow majorities, in November.

As a result, Democrats kept control of the governorship by a comfortable margin and flipped 15 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, bringing them within a hair of taking control of the legislative chamber.\n\nGiven the current political environment, I can\u2019t see any scenario where the Republicans don\u2019t claim [Northam] is either the Klansman or the person in blackface in mail or in TV. adviser to a Democratic state legislator in Virginia, on this year's state elections\n\nEven in the minority, the new Democratic cohort produced major policy wins for the party.

(The state Senate, which was not up for re-election in 2017, is in cycle in 2019.)\n\nUnified control of Virginia\u2019s state government could usher in a period of progressive lawmaking the likes of which the state has not experienced in decades \u2015 if at all.\n\nSome items on Democrats\u2019 agenda if they take control include raising the state\u2019s minimum wage and permanently restoring voting rights to former felons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, unified control would enable Democrats to run the redistricting process in 2021, preventing a repeat of the 2011 drawing in which Republicans heavily gerrymandered the congressional and state legislative district boundaries.\n\nBut a governor is the de facto face of a party \u2015 its chief fundraiser and advocate in the media. Candidates for state legislature frequently lack the name recognition that a highly visible figure like the governor wields.\n\nIf Northam remains in power, Democrats would not only lack the chance to deploy him as an asset in November, but also suffer from Republican willingness to turn him into a liability.\n\nNotwithstanding the Virginia GOP\u2019s willingness to traffic in explicit racial incitement \u2015 look no further than Ed Gillespie\u2019s gubernatorial bid and Corey Stewart\u2019s run for U.S. Senate \u2015 the party has pounced on the racist Northam photo.\n\nOur call for Ralph Northam's resignation stands.

The national emergency declaration gives Trump a chance to reroute other government money to fund the project \u2015 and sets up a legal battle that could tie up the president\u2019s signature project for months or years.\n\nTo justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.\n\n\u201cWe have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. There were roughly 520,000 arrests for unauthorized border crossings last year, which is about one-third of the 1.6 million arrests that happened in 2000. Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum.\n\nThe total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone. That will buy the administration some 234 miles of border wall, a senior administration official told reporters Friday.\n\nThe national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nThe Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture account.\n\nNone of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said.\n\nThe DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed.

An early and vocal Trump supporter, the Ohio-based chief executive donated $300,000 to the president\u2019s inauguration and another $1 million to a pro-Trump political action committee, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. In March 2017, Murray drafted a wishlist of policies submitted in the form of memos to the Energy Department \u2015 leaked photos show Wheeler, then a lobbyist, sitting beside the coal executive as he hugged Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2015 and to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nMurray\u2019s requests primarily targeted the EPA, urging draconian staff cuts, gutting a mercury regulation and reversing a bevy of standards on pollution ranging from ozone to toxic coal ash to planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. Of eight EPA policies Murray asked to be changed, the Trump administration took action on six, most of which were carried out since Wheeler took charge of the agency, Mother Jones reported. The report noted further action he took on at least three rules that the EPA first began tinkering with under Pruitt. Yet, on Friday, the EPA said \u201cto claim these actions were only carried out under his direction is demonstrably false.\u201d\n\nIn a telling moment, Wheeler proposed in December the rollback of an Obama-era rule requiring coal-fired plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the midst of the year\u2019s biggest global climate summit.\n\nOne reason Murray Energy may have terminated its contract with Faegre Baker Daniels is that, under the Trump administration\u2019s own ethics pledge, officials cannot meet with former employers for two years after taking office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that if Murray Energy goes to another firm, they could get a meeting before Wheeler personally,\u201d said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cAnother lobbying firm, if that\u2019s where they went, might be in a better position to move forward on Murray Energy\u2019s more immediate interests.\u201d\n\nMurray Energy has cut out the middleman. They\u2019ve got their pro-coal guy in the driver\u2019s seat at the EPA. Judith Enck, former regional EPA administrator\n\nThe ethics pledge might not be an impervious firewall. Two weeks ago, CREW filed a complaint with the EPA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General alleging that Wheeler may have violated his ethics pledge by participating in matters on which he previously lobbied and by holding meetings with his former clients. The EPA called the allegation \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\nBut Wheeler\u2019s time working for Murray \u2015 the coal executive said it lasted 20 years, though the EPA said that figure isn\u2019t accurate \u2015 became a sticking point at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, where Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) criticized a \u201csweet regulatory relationship\u201d between the coal executive and the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with a career ethics officials from day one,\u201d Wheeler said at the hearing. \u201cAnd I continue to consult with the career ethics officials on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine how Murray\u2019s business is doing because it\u2019s privately held and doesn\u2019t publicly report earnings, but there are some signs indicating financial distress. In April, Murray Energy warned that utility giant FirstEnergy Corp.\u2019s decision to close bankrupt coal-fired power plants would cost \u201cthousands of American jobs\u201d in mining. The company started negotiating with bondholders last spring as it began feeling the squeeze of interest payments on $2.8 billion in debt plus hundreds of millions of dollars in health and other benefits to retired coal miners, The Wall Street Journal reported last year.\n\nIn October, FirstEnergy announced plans to postpone the retirement of the Pleasants Coal Plant in West Virginia from 2019 to 2022. But, in December, a federal bankruptcy judge approved a contract settlement between Murray Energy and FirstEnergy.\n\nThe financial woes \u201ccan\u2019t be helping Murray in whatever it\u2019s doing,\u201d Steve Piper, an energy analyst at S&P Global, said by phone. \u201cThe point\u2019s well taken that Murray himself has lobbied the administration and Andrew Wheeler, his former lobbyist, is at the EPA.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-national-committee-trump-roger-stone_us_5c4b4bdbe4b06ba6d3bca589": "ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico \u2014 With airline traffic stressed because of President Donald Trump\u2019s government shutdown and another of his advisers indicted in the Russia investigation, his party\u2019s chairwoman on Friday had this message: Everything is fine.\n\n\u201cThis president and his administration continue to do incredible things for our country,\u201d Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said at its winter meeting.\n\nRepublicans lost 40 seats and control of the House of Representatives last November and picked up just two seats in the Senate despite having the most favorable map in decades.\n\nMcDaniel, however, spun the elections as a success for the party. \u201cWe minimized our losses in the House, in the face of a record 43 retirements,\u201d she said \u2014 but failed to mention that many of the retirements took place because Republican members felt they could not win because of Trump\u2019s unpopularity.\n\nIn her remarks, she did not mention Friday morning\u2019s indictment of former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, but did refer to what she called \u201cmanufactured scandals and baseless allegations\u201d against Trump.\n\nThe indictment in the case, referred by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office, states that Stone was in contact with a senior official of the Trump campaign in the final months of the 2016 presidential race regarding the release of stolen Hillary Clinton campaign emails. The U.S. intelligence community has stated that the emails were stolen by Russian spy agencies and passed along to WikiLeaks for release.\n\nTrump spent the final month of the campaign praising WikiLeaks at his rallies and telling his supporters to read the emails \u2014 even though the Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence on Oct. 7 stated that WikiLeaks was acting in concert with Russia.\n\n\u201cWe love WikiLeaks!\u201d Trump said frequently.\n\nShortly before her speech, McDaniel said she had not read or seen any news coverage about Stone\u2019s indictment and could not comment on it. Many other RNC members gathered at the Hyatt Tamaya resort outside Albuquerque also said they did not know much about the indictment.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read it yet,\u201d said Ron Kaufman, a longtime RNC member from Massachusetts. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on something I haven\u2019t read.\u201d\n\nThe RNC did, however, unanimously pass a resolution offering \u201cits undivided support for President Donald J. Trump and his effective presidency.\u201d\n\nThe statement of support, though, does not mean the RNC is locked into backing Trump against any challengers in a primary, particularly if the Mueller investigation winds up causing legal troubles for Trump or his family, Ohio RNC member Jim Dicke said.\n\n\u201cActually these resolutions have no meaning,\u201d he said, adding that it was done only because some members particularly supportive of Trump wanted to express that. \u201cWhat are the rest of us supposed to do?

However, many staffers are reportedly skipping work, which could mean a delay.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, hundreds of IRS employees have been granted absences due to financial hardship, and their union said that an organized protest could cause even more workers to stay home.\n\nWith the shutdown dragging into its second month, National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon demanded that the government figure out a way to help the IRS workers.\n\n\u201cFederal employees are about to miss their second paycheck and they are growing increasingly desperate,\u201d Reardon said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe suffering of thousands of middle-class working families has to end, and it has to end now.\u201d\n\nReardon also said it was \u201cgrossly unfair that federal employees are the pawns in someone else\u2019s fight,\u201d adding that \u201cthe situation is dire.\u201d\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on Thursday on two competing plans to reopen the government. One bill is backed by Democrats and the other is backed by the GOP, yet both are almost certain to fail, leaving no clear end in sight to the shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-blamed-for-government-shutdowns_us_5c3cb57ce4b0e0baf53fae08": "When President Donald Trump decided to plunge the country into a partial government shutdown, Republican leaders in Congress warned him against doing so.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to convince the president he had no leverage and wouldn\u2019t be able to make Democrats give him $5.7 billion to build a border wall. Paul Ryan, who was then the speaker of the House, told Trump he saw no way for Republicans to win a standoff. And Kevin McCarthy, then the House majority leader, warned that a shutdown during the holiday season was a bad idea.\n\nTrump, nevertheless, pushed ahead, refusing to sign legislation to keep the government operating \u2015 unless he received money for his border wall, which during the campaign he said Mexico would pay for.\n\nRepublican leaders had good reason to be cautious about shutting down the government: The GOP would probably get blamed for it. Historically, the public tends to hold the Republican Party for such impasses.\n\n\u201cRepublicans usually get the blame for shutdowns because they usually cause the shutdowns, which is inevitable as they have become more controlled by their ideologically extreme members,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster with Greenberg Quinlan Rosner.\n\nTrump is learning this lesson now. The current shutdown is the longest in history, with no end in sight. He continues to insist on money for his border wall, while Democrats refuse to give it to him.\n\nThe public is blaming Trump for the mess, according to polls by HuffPost/YouGov and other news outlets. To be clear, no one in government comes out looking especially good during a shutdown, but he is being held responsible (as he once said he wanted to be).\n\nAlthough three Senate Republicans have called for the government to reopen, most are sticking by Trump \u2015 even despite the loss of public support.\n\n\u201cHe actually is moving the numbers in his direction compared to a year ago, in terms of the wall,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) argued Tuesday.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) added that \u201cthe president has moved further in trying to find a balance there than the other side has.\u201d\n\nVoters blamed congressional Republicans for a shutdown in 2013 (when the GOP wanted to extract concessions on killing Obamacare) and two from 1995 to 1996 (when President Bill Clinton refused to go along with GOP budget cuts).\n\nNewt Gingrich certainly didn\u2019t help his party gain support for the shutdowns in the 1990s. Gingrich, who was House speaker, was already unpopular. Then he indicated that he had shut down the government for a very personal reason: He felt Clinton snubbed him on a flight from Israel in November.\n\n\u201cThis is petty,\u201d Gingrich told reporters, according to a Nov. 17, 1995, article in The Washington Post. \u201c[But] you land at Andrews [Air Force Base] and you\u2019ve been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp. \u2026 You just wonder, where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy?\u201d\n\nClinton also effectively used his bully pulpit to shame Republicans, highlighting the personal toll of the shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. During his 1996 State of the Union address, he honored the service of Richard Dean, a heroic public servant who risked his life to save others during the Oklahoma City bombing the previous April. He was sat in the first lady\u2019s box for the address, and when Clinton honored Dean\u2019s service, the entire chamber applauded him. From Clinton\u2019s speech:\n\nI\u2019d like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who\u2019s worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the federal building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He re-entered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He\u2019s here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism.\n\nThen Clinton delivered his kicker: Dean had been furloughed during the shutdowns. Clinton\u2019s call for Congress to never again shut down the government received boisterous cheers from Democrats. Gingrich, meanwhile, sat awkwardly at the dais behind Clinton.\n\nBut Richard Dean\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time the government shut down, he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. On behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In his 1996 State of the Union speech, President Bill Clinton called out Republicans for shutting down the government.\n\nThe ensuing coverage declared Clinton\u2019s speech a success and panned the GOP response from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (Kan.). The San Jose Mercury News praised Clinton\u2019s \u201cconciliatory-sounding speech\u201d and criticized Dole\u2019s \u201csharply partisan response.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton ate the Republicans\u2019 supper Tuesday night, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is expected to depart the Justice Department after Barr\u2019s anticipated confirmation, and as attorney general he would oversee the investigation unless he recuses himself.\n\nBarr would not commit to following the recommendations of career ethics officials about whether he might need to recuse himself but said he would consult with the officials.\n\nThe man Barr would replace as head of the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions, quickly recused himself from overseeing the Russia probe because he played a direct role in helping Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.

The early voting period would begin 10 days prior to an election and end two days before it, and would have to include at least two full weekends. The bill would require local election boards to establish one early voting site for every 50,000 voters in their jurisdiction, up to seven sites \u2015 though they could vote to authorize more. The measure would take effect for the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity, now that we have a Democratic majority, to include more people in the democratic process.

John Flanagan, the Republican leader in the state Senate, did not respond to a request for comment on the bills. Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for the state Republican Party, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter 3 decades of election reformers seemingly banging our heads against a brick wall of Albany obstruction, it\u2019s incredible to see this package of election bills advance. Neal Rosenstein, NYPRIG government reform coordinator\n\nDemocrats also want to change New York\u2019s voting law to allow people to register to vote on the same day they cast a ballot, and to let people cast an absentee ballot without supplying an excuse. Those changes will take more time, however, because they require amending the state constitution. To do that, lawmakers will have to pass constitutional amendments in two consecutive legislative sessions, and voters then have to approve it through a statewide referendum. Democrats say they plan to pass constitutional amendments to implement no-excuse absentee voting and eliminate the 10-day registration cutoff in the state constitution, but the next legislative session \u2015 the second of two in which they would have to pass those measures \u2015 doesn\u2019t begin until 2021.\n\nMike Long, the chairman of the state\u2019s Conservative Party, told The Buffalo News that establishing early voting would help boost Democratic turnout. But a 2017 paper from political scientists at the University of Wisconsin found that early voting established without same-day registration \u2015 which will be the circumstances in New York, at least temporarily \u2015 actually boosts GOP turnout.\n\nDemocrats also support legislation to automatically register voters when they interact with a state agency, but that measure isn\u2019t among those lawmakers plan to take up Monday. The first pieces of legislation likewise don\u2019t address the extremely early cutoff date by which voters must change their party if they want to vote in a primary contest.\n\nState Sen. Michael Gianaris, a top Democrat, told The New York Times lawmakers will act on more legislation as the session progresses.\n\nSusan Lerner, executive director of the New York chapter of Common Cause, a good government group that has championed the reforms, said it was significant that lawmakers were focusing on voting in the first substantive bill they would pass. She said she expected to work with lawmakers on more reforms like automatic voter registration and restoring voting rights to people with felony convictions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very ambitious to expect that the legislature would end basically 100 years of drought on election reform in one day in one bill,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat said, they are passing what is truly meaningful reform. And it\u2019s a fabulous first step towards catching New York up with the rest of the country. That doesn\u2019t mean that there still isn\u2019t plenty to be done.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-ruth-bader-ginsburg_us_5c3c6567e4b0922a21d683ab": "Amid reports the White House is gearing up for the potential replacement of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) announced her Green New Deal resolution last Thursday in front of the Senate.\n\nA majority of likely 2020 voters supports key aspects of a Green New Deal even when faced with potential costs and downsides, but strict regulations to decarbonize the nation\u2019s top polluters could trigger a backlash, according to a new poll from proponents of the policy.\n\nThe survey, released by the think tank Data for Progress and shared with HuffPost, found net support for a range of policies, including improving drinking water infrastructure, reforesting land, providing job training and insurance to displaced workers and guaranteeing clean-energy jobs.\n\n\u201cAt the core, the Green New Deal is about a moral imperative to transform our economy and improve people\u2019s lives for the better,\u201d said Greg Carlock, the researcher at Data for Progress and architect of the first Green New Deal blueprint published last September. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on that, but even when you do, people still support it.\u201d\n\nBut faced with a range of possible price tags, voters\u2019 support varied, suggesting costs could factor high into the Green New Deal\u2019s political viability. The results showed a majority of voters would likely oppose policies with stringent mandates \u2015 rules requiring all cars be electric by 2030 and every fossil fuel power plant close by 2035.\n\nTo test the support, Data for Progress commissioned the Democratic pollster Civis Analytics to survey 3,496 likely voters between Jan. 4 - 26 on 11 policies expected to be included a Green New Deal. The poll tested four different cost scenarios on each question, randomly alternating between zero, low, medium and high prices to test how the cost of a policy weighed on one-quarter of respondents\u2019 opinions.\n\nThe green jobs guarantee, considered by Green New Deal proponents to be the heart of the suite of policies, proved one of the tricker components. In a lengthy prompt, the survey asked respondents if they support or oppose a policy that Democrats promised would \u201cguarantee an environmentally friendly job to every American adult, with the government providing jobs for people who can\u2019t find employment in the private sector.\u201d\n\nThe question described the job as a position that would pay \u201cat least $15 an hour, included healthcare benefits, and collective bargaining rights.\u201d The surveyors added that Republicans warned the policy \u201cwould increase the national debt, endanger the long term health of our economy, and this policy will end up paying people who can\u2019t contribute in the job market to perform pointless busy work.\u201d\n\nThirty-nine percent supported the green jobs guarantee, 33 percent opposed and 27 didn\u2019t know. Without a price, voters were 9 percentage points likelier to support than oppose the policy. At a low of $100 billion, support hit 2 percentage points. Voters were about evenly divided on policies costing $500 billion or $1 trillion.\n\nMandates requiring the country to generate 100 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2050 enjoyed sweeping support. The question noted that Democrats believed such a policy would \u201ckickstart the renewable energy sector, creating jobs for many Americans and ensuring that America leads the world in green technology,\u201d while Republicans said, \u201cthis would take away freedom from American consumers, put people out of work, and raise prices for everything from transportation to consumer goods.\u201d\n\nThirty-eight percent supported the proposal, 33 percent opposed and 30 percent didn\u2019t know. Without a price, voters backed the policy by 7 percentage points. At a low of $25 billion, that figure fell to 2 percentage points. Support held steady at 1 percentage point for both a medium cost of $37.5 billion and a high of $50 billion. Age impacted support at the unstated price level. Voters aged 18 to 34 supported the policy by 15 percentage points, while those 65 and older opposed the policy by 11 percentage points.\n\nPolicies improving drinking water infrastructure proved to be the most popular. The survey outlined a proposal to improve infrastructure \u201cand replace lead pipes,\u201d considering that Republicans \u201csay that our drinking infrastructure is in good shape already, and this represents a wasteful use of resources that will burden our children with debt.\u201d\n\nHalf of the respondents supported the proposal, 21 percent opposed and 29 percent didn\u2019t know. At no stated price, voters supported the proposal by 36 percentage points. Faced with a low cost of $25 billion, support sank to 27 percentage points. At a medium cost of $37.5 billion, the percentage dropped to 23. At a high of $50 billion, it fell to 22 percentage points.\n\nThe least popular policy was one \u201cproposing requiring that all new cars sold be electric by 2030.\u201d The question said, \u201cDemocrats say this would help stop climate change, save thousands of lives by reducing pollution, and make the U.S. the definitive leader in the electric car industry.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say this would take away freedom from American consumers, put people making cars out of work, and make new cars unaffordable for the average American. Do you support or oppose this policy?\u201d\n\nJust 26 percent supported the policy, with 44 percent opposed and 33 percent unsure. Without even seeing a price, voters opposed the electric car mandate by 15 percentage points.\n\nThe second-least popular was a proposal \u201crequiring that all fossil fuel plants (coal, natural gas and oil) cease operating by 2035\u201d in an effort to \u201chelp stop climate change\u201d that Republicans say \u201cwould put many Americans out of work, and could lead to an energy crisis as energy prices soar.\u201d\n\nVoters opposed the measure by 3 percentage points, again without seeing a price.\n\nThe findings come just weeks before the Senate is expected to hold a vote on the Green New Deal resolution Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) released last week. The measure, essentially a political statement outlining the scope of what\u2019s needed to prepare the U.S. for a rapidly warming climate, staked out an ambitious list of policies to protect vulnerable communities already suffering from pollution.\n\nIn what Green New Deal supporters called a cynical ploy to up halt their movement\u2019s growing momentum, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a veteran climate change denier who\u2019s taken millions from the fossil fuel industry, vowed this week to hold a vote, forcing swing-state senators to take positions on a policy Republicans are aggressively working to vilify.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans understand climate change is happening and human-caused emissions are the primary cause. In December, 81 percent of registered voters supported the goals of the Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans, according to a poll from Yale and George Mason universities. But the pollsters warned that the overwhelming bipartisan support could erode as the Green New Deal became more closely associated with individual politicians.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, the grassroots climate advocacy group whose thousands of volunteers helped propel the Green New Deal into the national stage in November with a series of protests against top Democrats, said Wednesday it would ramp up actions confronting both Democrats and swing-state Republicans, urging them to support the policy.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, already maintains an Office of Sustainability and an Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which oversee the city\u2019s OneNYC climate plan.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the progressive firebrand representing a district stretching from the Bronx to Queens, is spearheading the most dramatic shift in American climate politics in decades, crusading for a so-called Green New Deal that would overhaul the economy and make the United States the world leader on reducing emissions. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Brooklyn native, serves as the Senate minority leader at a historic moment in the administration of President Donald Trump, himself a native New Yorker. De Blasio is now rumored to be considering joining the crowded field of Democrats making 2020 bids for the White House.\n\nIt could be a good thing ... it may just be shuffling deck chairs around. Ashley Dawson, author of \"Extreme Cities\"\n\nThe establishment of a climate department would organize the disparate but growing efforts to prepare for a warmer, hotter and more densely populated city.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, City Councilman Mark Treyger, a Brooklyn Democrat, introduced a bill that would mandate the city\u2019s transportation regulators to study the feasibility of painting streets in overheated residential neighborhoods with a special coating to reduce the so-called urban heat island effect that kills up to 600 mostly poor New Yorkers each year.\n\nIn January, Constantinides proposed a bill that would require the city to devise a plan to phase out its 24 oil- and gas-burning power stations and replace them with renewables and batteries. Two months earlier, the lawmaker introduced legislation to mandate dramatic retrofits to cut energy and water use in buildings over 25,000 square feet, the city\u2019s largest source of climate pollution.\n\nDe Blasio kicked off 2018 by filing a landmark lawsuit against five oil giants, seeking to recoup the costs of damages linked to climate change. At the same time, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer announced plans to divest the city\u2019s $200 billion pension funds of oil and gas.\n\nThe efforts are starting to filter up to the state level. For years, the Republican-controlled state Senate blocked climate legislation that passed in the Assembly from even coming up for a vote. Now that Democrats control the entire Legislature, the New York State Climate and Community Protection Act, a bill hailed by activists as one of the most progressive pieces of climate legislation in the nation, is poised to come up for a vote. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) vowed to pursue a Green New Deal of his own.\n\nIn October, the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change determined world governments have roughly a decade to halve global emissions or face cataclysmic global warming.

He called the announcement a \u201chistoric moment for the agency and the American public.\u201d\n\nWheeler said the EPA had \u201calready begun the regulatory development process for listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances,\u201d making it easier to marshal funds to clean up contaminations. He said the plan would include new research methods to monitor pollution.\n\nReports last month said Wheeler, widely condemned for his links to big industry, would not regulate the chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds \u2015 sometimes called perfluorinated substances, or PFAS \u2015 at all. But critics say the EPA has gathered more than enough data over the past decade to propose an immediate drinking water standard, called a maximum contaminant limit.\n\n\u201cEPA needs to release strict drinking water standards and not just do a plan or do more research,\u201d said Judith Enck, a former regional EPA administrator who began dealing with a PFAS crisis in upstate New York in 2014. \u201cThere is enough data to take action. There is not enough urgency by Acting Administrator Wheeler and he is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came as the EPA published its proposal to gut the Waters of the U.S. rule, which extended protections to streams and wetlands that feed the drinking water of 117 million Americans.\n\nPFAS represent a family of chemicals that stick to water molecules and remain in the environment for decades. The chemicals are linked to rare forms of cancer, reproductive problems and thyroid disease.\n\nAssociated Press New York state Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin, a Republican, shows photos of children from Hoosick Falls, N.Y., whose blood has high levels of toxic PFOA.\n\nThough no longer being manufactured, PFAS remain in many everyday products, including nonstick Teflon, firefighting foam and fast-food wrappers.\n\nWheeler, whose nomination to be the nation\u2019s 15th EPA administrator awaits a Senate confirmation vote, took heat for refusing to commit to regulating PFAS at a hearing last month. Politico reported in January that the EPA did not plan to limit the chemicals.\n\nWheeler repeatedly stressed at Thursday\u2019s news conference that the EPA has continued efforts to clean up contaminated drinking water and enforce current water health advisories for the toxic chemicals as it worked on the action plan.\n\nAsked if it was possible the EPA may eventually fail to set a maximum containment limit, or MCL, Wheeler said the agency \u201ccan\u2019t predetermine what the outcome will be,\u201d but \u201chas every intention of setting an MCL.\u201d\n\nThe health and environmental effects of PFAS remained virtually ignored by regulators for decades. In the late 1990s, a crusading attorney sued E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. over a massive contamination in Parkersburg, West Virginia, that killed livestock and sickened and deformed many residents in the rural Appalachian community that surrounded the chemical company\u2019s plant. After a years-long legal battle, DuPont divested its Chemours division and the companies reached a $670 million agreement to settle 3,550 personal injury lawsuits in February 2017. Minnesota-based chemical giant 3M is now facing mounting lawsuits of its own.\n\nThere is not enough urgency by Acting Administrator Wheeler and he is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk. Judith Enck, former administrator for EPA Region 2\n\nYet the chemicals remain unregulated at the federal level. In January 2009, the EPA issued its first advisory in response to contamination in Alabama, stating that perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, one of the chemicals in the family, posed a health risk only in concentrations higher than 400 parts per trillion. For perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, a sister chemical commonly used in fire retardants, the EPA pegged the limit at 200 parts per trillion.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA issued a new health advisory lowering the risk threshold to 70 parts per trillion for both PFOA and PFOS. That set off a chain reaction, exposing local contaminations across the country, including several in New York State.\n\nLast May, the EPA hosted a national leadership summit on PFAS, but the agency\u2019s decision to bar reporters from attending sessions and one official\u2019s manhandling of an Associated Press reporter overshadowed the event. Later that month, the White House and EPA moved to suppress an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry report that found PFAS pose health risks at 70 parts per trillion. A safer limit would be closer to 11 parts per trillion, the agency determined.\n\nIn the meantime, some states began regulating the chemicals. In 2016, Vermont set a 20-parts-per-trillion health advisory for PFOA and PFOS, and expanded the advisory to include three other PFAS chemicals last summer.\n\nIn May 2017, Minnesota lowered its advisory levels to roughly half that of the EPA\u2019s \u2015 setting a limit of 35 parts per trillion for PFOA and 27 parts per trillion for PFOS.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazon-new-york-hq2-andrew-cuomo-alexandria-ocasio-cortez_n_5c65a129e4b0aec93d3c9d26": "Amazon\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s scrapping controversial plans to build an additional headquarters in New York City provoked rounds of blame and celebration Thursday.\n\nReactions were swift on both sides of the issue after the massive company said earlier Thursday that it wasn\u2019t willing to work with state and local politicians who oppose the plan.\n\nGov.

But Democrats are far from convinced that Barr \u2015 who\u2019s been nominated to replace frequent Trump foil and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2015 would protect the Russia probe, and plan to use Barr\u2019s confirmation hearing on Tuesday to extract additional commitments.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) \u2015 in a letter obtained by HuffPost that the senator hand-delivered to the 68-year-old Barr at a meeting on Thursday \u2015 laid out several lines of questioning ahead of Barr\u2019s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning. Whitehouse raised a number of questions he had for Barr about his communications with the Trump White House, Justice Department officials, and Trump\u2019s legal team.\n\nGetty William Barr (left), Trump's nominee for attorney general, sent a 19-page memo to Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein in June objecting to Robert Mueller's (right) investigation.\n\nWhitehouse\u2019s letter zeroes in on an unsolicited June 8, 2018 memorandum that Barr sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose anticipated departure has only heightened Democratic concerns about Barr\u2019s appointment. Barr\u2019s 19-page memo suggested that it wasn\u2019t legitimate for Mueller to investigate whether the president obstructed justice by pressuring former FBI Director James Comey to drop the FBI investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn the letter, Whitehouse also raised concerns that Trump might want Barr to play the role of Robert Bork, the former solicitor general who \u2015 after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned in protest \u2015 followed President Richard Nixon\u2019s order to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox as he investigated Nixon\u2019s role in Watergate. Whitehouse wrote about an agreement that Bork, then acting attorney general, signed in the wake of what became known as the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d that offered assurances about the independence of Leon Jaworkski, who replaced Cox as special prosecutor.\n\n\u201cYour agreement to follow in the footsteps of Robert Bork would provide significant assurances to those who fear your appointment is a prelude to another Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d Whitehouse wrote to Barr.\n\nBarr\u2019s confirmation hearing should make for compelling television. The Senate Judiciary Committee, now chaired by frequent Trump defender Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), includes several prominent Democrats, including a few who are expected to seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The hearing is taking place as the nearly 20-month-old Mueller probe enters a pivotal stage, as Mueller appears to be wrapping up his investigation and preparing a highly anticipated report on his conclusions that might jump-start a movement to impeach Trump in the Democratic-controlled House. And it all comes amid an ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left much of the Justice Department Barr hopes to head furloughed or working without pay.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate with 53 members, so Democrats can\u2019t do much to stop his confirmation on their own. But they can press Barr for commitments to insure the independence of the Mueller investigation as it enters a crucial timeframe.\n\nBarr, in prepared remarks provided to reporters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, seemed to be operating under the notion that he would seize control of the Mueller investigation after his confirmation. His prepared opening remarks make no reference to consulting with career ethics officials within DOJ about whether his unsolicited memo about the Mueller probe created an appearance of impropriety that might suggest he should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who defended Trump on cable news before joining the Justice Department, rejected the advice of a DOJ ethics official who suggested he should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.

Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Monday that Barr set a \u201cgood tone\u201d with his prepared remarks before the committee, adding that he \u201chelped himself significantly\u201d by addressing some questions regarding his past criticisms of the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee member added, however, that he still has outstanding concerns about Barr\u2019s views on presidential power, the use of pardons, and his willingness to submit to advice from the department\u2019s ethics officials.\n\n\u201cHis last confirmation hearing was 27 years ago \u2015 we can\u2019t pretend that these are similar times.

Breaking down the numbers, she surged 14 points among Democrats, 8 points among independents and even gone up 1 point with Republicans.\n\nIn Gallup polls, Pelosi is more popular than she has been in a decade. Trump\u2019s approval, meanwhile, is tanking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at all that it is a smart, effective and powerful woman that is finally putting a check on Trump. Speaker Pelosi is, and has always been, a boss,\u201d said Shaunna Thomas with UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pelosi wrote to Trump that, with no end in sight to the shutdown, it would be best if he not deliver his State of the Union address to a joint congressional session on Jan. 29, suggesting that he provide the traditional speech in writing instead. She said it was wrong to hold the event since the Secret Service is among the agencies hit by the shutdown and its agents are working without funding.\n\nPelosi, in other words, was taking away one of Trump\u2019s favorite things: a big TV audience.\n\nIn response on Thursday, Trump said he was canceling a planned official foreign trip was spearheading that included a stop in Afghanistan, which required travel with military personnel.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) jumped into the 2020 presidential race on Tuesday with a campaign that will make gender more of a central focus than any other candidate.\n\nThe focus was clear right from the start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to run for president of the United States because, as a young mom, I am going to fight for other people\u2019s kids as hard as I fight for my own, which is why I believe health care is a right and not a privilege,\u201d Gillibrand said on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d when she announced the formation of her exploratory committee.\n\nIn a two-minute introductory video released with her announcement, the first thing highlighted is that she\u2019s a mom to two boys.\n\nGillibrand has been an advocate for getting more women involved in politics and has made women\u2019s issues a focus of her work in the Senate. Women powered the 2018 midterm elections, leading to a record number of women running for office and getting elected to seats in the House. Much of Gillibrand\u2019s strategy rests on winning over these engaged female voters.\n\n\u201cKirsten has been a champion for women and families her entire career, and she is excited to show voters her style of leadership focused on compassion, courage and the determination to get things done,\u201d said Gillibrand communications director Meredith Kelly.\n\n\u201cThe campaign believes that the lesson of 2018 is that the future of the Democratic Party is with women; opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is fueled by women; a majority of women around the country took a greater interest in politics and became more involved in the political process after 2016,\u201d a Gillibrand adviser added. \u201cThey contributed, volunteered, voted, ran for office and won.\u201d\n\nGillibrand, of course, isn\u2019t the only woman running for president, and she isn\u2019t starting out as a frontrunner. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) have already announced that they\u2019re running, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is widely expected to jump into the field as well.\n\nBut Gillibrand is expected to make gender a more central component of her run than any of the other candidates in the race, reflecting the focus of her time in the Senate.\n\nShe is perhaps best known for her years-long fight against sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. She also pushed her Senate colleagues to pass legislation overhauling how Congress deals with sexual harassment in its ranks.\n\nGillibrand\u2019s introductory video also highlighted her work securing funds for 9/11 first responders, repealing \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and opposing Trump\u2019s agenda. But even those accomplishments subtly seemed to play to her emphasis on being a mom, stressing that she can get things done.\n\nMore recently, Gillibrand has been in the national spotlight for calling out prominent men in the Democratic Party for sexual harassment \u2015 moves that have earned her some enemies.\n\nIn November 2017, Gillibrand said that Bill Clinton should have resigned as president during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Calling out the former president was shocking within the party, but it was even more eye-catching because Gillibrand was close to the Clinton world and Hillary Clinton was something of a mentor to her.\n\nThe following month, Gillibrand then became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct.\n\nThe move wasn\u2019t all that surprising, considering Gillibrand\u2019s record and career. But it still angered some of Franken\u2019s defenders, including prominent donors like George Soros saying they would refuse to support her in 2020.\n\nGillibrand refused to back down and went after Soros.\n\n\u201cIf standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that\u2019s on him,\u201d Gillibrand told HuffPost in August. \u201cBut I won\u2019t hesitate to always do what I think is right. For nearly a year, we have seen countless acts of courage as women and men have spoken hard truths about sexual assault and sexual harassment and demanded accountability.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shutdown-national-emergency-lindsey-graham_us_5c3b4c5be4b0922a21d5c97e": "UPDATE: Jan. 14 \u2015 President Donald Trump on Monday rejected a suggestion from Sen.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged President Donald Trump to reopen the federal government for a short period to see if a deal can be reached with Democrats before declaring a national emergency over border security.\n\nTrump has refrained from going that route, which would involve bypassing Congress to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border with unidentified Pentagon funds. The president told reporters on Friday that he wasn\u2019t planning to make a declaration \u201cright now\u201d but that he would if he had to.\n\nThe idea has gotten pushback in Congress, however. Some Republicans who railed against executive overreach during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration now fear that a future Democratic president could similarly declare a national emergency and fund projects without congressional approval.\n\n\u201cIf today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said this week.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats also said they believe the move would likely be challenged in court, blocking construction of a wall the administration has said is needed immediately to address an urgent \u201ccrisis\u201d on the border.\n\nDuring an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Graham suggested that Trump sign a bill funding the government for three weeks to allow time for further negotiations with Democrats before the president \u201cpulls the plug\u201d on an emergency declaration.\n\nGraham\u2019s comments are significant, given that he has been one of the president\u2019s biggest allies in Congress, steadfastly urging him not to back down on the wall or else risk an end to his presidency. A three-week continuing resolution signals a walk-back from that hard-line position.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican added in the interview that he spoke with the president shortly before his television appearance and told him he would support an emergency declaration.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my last option,\u201d Trump said, according to Graham.\n\nDemocrats have been calling on Trump and Senate Republicans to allow a vote on a short-term bill that would open the government, giving the two sides more time for talks.\n\n\u201cWhat Lindsey Graham just told the president is a great place to start,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said in a separate appearance on \u201dFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe consequences of the partial government shutdown are mounting \u2015 for national parks, airports, food inspections, emergency preparations and a host of other services. Some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck on Friday, prompting fears among many of taking on debt to pay for food, medication, rent and loans.\n\nRepublicans are also losing the battle for public opinion amid the partial shutdown, which is now the longest in history. Fifty-three percent of Americans surveyed said Trump and the GOP are at fault for the shutdown, while only 29 percent said Democrats are to blame, according to a Washington Post/ABC poll released Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump will heed Graham\u2019s suggestion.

While such political spending has been legal in some forms since the 1970s, it exploded in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nMost of the liberal spending in 2018 came from a single group: Majority Forward, a nonprofit controlled by allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The group reported $46 million in spending to the Federal Election Commission, about one-third of the total money spent. Another group linked to Schumer, Patriot Majority, spent an additional $5.7 million. Both groups were trying to defend a slew of Democratic incumbents in states President Donald Trump had won two years earlier.\n\nMajority Forward\u2019s heavy spending fueled a significant shift from earlier midterm election cycles. In 2010, conservative dark-money groups outspent liberal ones by an 11-to-1 margin, according to the report. In 2014, the margin was more than 3-to-1.\n\nMuch of the shift is also due to conservative groups \u2015 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the powerful Koch Network of donors \u2015 spending less than in previous elections, and to other conservative groups focusing on so-called issue ads instead of ads directly attacking or supporting candidates.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Zach Wamp, a member of an advisory board for Issue One, said Democrats\u2019 embrace of dark money was a reason for Republicans to support reforms to force disclosure.\n\n\u201cThis should be a wake-up call to Republicans,\u201d Wamp said in a statement. \u201cSecret spending in elections has the potential to denigrate every candidate in every election, and candidates are losing complete control of the messages in their campaigns to these outside groups.\u201d\n\nWhile Schumer and other Democrats have called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision and other measures to force groups to disclose their donors, many have defended the use of dark-money groups, arguing the party shouldn\u2019t unilaterally disarm in the face of Republican attacks.\n\nWhile most of Majority Forward\u2019s donors will never be revealed, the group received a $350,000 donation from Michael Arougheti, the CEO of private equity firm Ares Management and a $250,000 donation from William Conway, the co-founder of The Carlyle Group, another private equity firm, according to public records. CVS Health Corp., the parent company of the pharmacy chain, donated $250,000, and a group backed by Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer gave $200,000.\n\nDemocrats running for the 2020 nomination for president have largely sworn off corporate PAC money, and most have said they don\u2019t want super PACs \u2015 which are independent of any campaign \u2015 to back them.

And once Americans hear some of the common attacks that conservatives deploy against government-run insurance schemes, they get more skittish about the idea.\n\nThose are some of the key findings in a new poll from the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The results say a lot about why so many Democrats are talking about ideas like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d these days \u2015 and why, to succeed, those Democrats still have a lot of work to do.\n\nFor the first time in roughly a decade, Democrats rather than Republicans are the ones dreaming and talking about passing major new health care legislation. That\u2019s because Democrats for most of the last 10 years had their hands full trying to stop Republicans from undermining or repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHenry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDemocrats are in the majority now, which means they can convene committee hearings, craft legislation and even put it to a vote \u2015 all with an eye to 2020, when Democrats hope to recapture the Senate and the White House.\n\nAnd there is a lot to do, Democrats realize.\n\nThe boldest, most sweeping idea Democrats have is the one that Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, made famous in his 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He and his allies want to create a single government-run program that would cover all medical expenses and enroll every single person living in the U.S.\n\nMedicare for all, as they call it, has become a rallying cry for progressives. Supporters include Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected Democrat from New York, and three Democratic senators \u2015 Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2015 who are running (or formally exploring runs) for the presidency in 2020.\n\nThe idea is also popular, according to the new Kaiser poll. Fifty-six percent of Americans \u201cstrongly favor\u201d or \u201csomewhat favor\u201d the idea, compared with 42 percent who \u201csomewhat oppose\u201d or \u201cstrongly oppose.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s an open question just how strong or solid that support is.\n\nWhen Kaiser asked respondents whether they thought they could keep their current insurance under a Medicare for all scheme, 57 percent said they could. In reality, the whole point of Medicare for all would be to wipe away current insurance arrangements and replace them with a new public plan.\n\nProponents of Medicare for all know this. They argue that the public plan would be simpler, more comprehensive and ultimately less costly for most Americans.\n\nKaiser actually tested to see how some of those arguments would affect public opinion and, sure enough, people were even more excited about Medicare for all when they heard, among other things, that it would eliminate premiums, copays and deductibles.\n\nBut Kaiser also tested some of the arguments that Republicans and other opponents of Medicare for all have made against such schemes \u2015 and already are making now. When respondents heard that Medicare for all would eliminate private insurance, for example, support dropped dramatically, with just 37 percent favoring it and 58 percent opposing.\n\nKaiser also asked respondents about some other Democratic ideas that call for creating or expanding government-run insurance but without making it a system for everybody. These ideas include some relatively moderate steps, like opening up Medicare to people 55 and over \u2015 or offering Medicaid to anybody without access to employer coverage.\n\nYet another idea Kaiser tested is a more ambitious initiative that would create a new government-run insurance plan open to anybody, on a voluntary basis. In this scheme, employers would have the option to keep offering their own plans, thereby giving their employees a choice.\n\nIn Kaiser\u2019s polls, these proposals were even more popular than Medicare for all, although Kaiser didn\u2019t test how these ideas held up to common conservative criticisms.\n\nAnother poll finding was about priorities: 51 percent of self-identified Democrats think it\u2019s more important for their party to focus on improving and protecting the Affordable Care Act, while 38 percent think it\u2019s more important to pass Medicare for all.\n\nThis has not been the focus of much political debate lately, although bolstering the 2010 health care law is something that nearly all Democrats have said they want to do.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-native-american-warren-joke_n_5c646c11e4b09e2092c281bc": "Pool via Getty Images President Donald Trump in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson, the former president and slave owner who signed the Indian Removal Act that led to the Trail of Tears. Trump chose to put Jackson's portrait in the Oval Office and has said he is \"a fan.\"\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Over the weekend, the president of the United States appeared to make a punchline out of Native American genocide to score political points. You might have missed it because hardly any of the nation\u2019s top leaders called him out on it.\n\n\u201cToday Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWill she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the apparent offensiveness of the president\u2019s words. Trump\u2019s use of \u201cTRAIL\u201d in all-caps evokes the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of Native Americans from their homeland in the southeastern United States, which led to thousands of deaths from disease, starvation and exposure. His constant mockery of Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d meanwhile, demeans a historic Native woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Cherokee woman. I have ancestors who were on the trail. And I was \u2015 at this point, I shouldn\u2019t be shocked by anything that President Trump says or does \u2015 I was honestly shocked,\u201d said Candessa Tehee, an assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Northeastern State University. \u201cThat he\u2019s willing to so casually invoke the darkest chapter of American history to take a cheap shot at a rival, I was flabbergasted.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for clarification on what Trump was getting at with this remark.\n\nBut the paradox of Trump is that he is so casually racist against Native Americans, and yet, his slurs go largely unchallenged by both Democratic and Republican leaders \u2015 even as Native groups denounce him.\n\nThis time, some Republicans even tacitly endorsed Trump\u2019s mockery: Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who chairs the House GOP Conference, shrugged off his tweet when asked about it Sunday and tried to refocus on Warren. On the same day as the president\u2019s tweet, the Republican Party sent out a press release titled \u201cFauxcahontas\u2019 Failure To Launch.\u201d Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., piled on Trump\u2019s remark with his own slur.\n\n\u201cWe see our elected officials speaking out vehemently against racism regularly, yet very few have condemned Trump\u2019s racist rants against Natives,\u201d said Raina Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes under President Barack Obama and currently a consultant on tribal policy. \u201cI believe this silence is rooted in the continued invisibility of Native people and the lack of political will by politicians. Some don\u2019t think they have to speak out, so they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNone of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders appeared to directly condemn Trump\u2019s apparent Trail of Tears reference.

The only one of those four who responded to a request for comment was Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said, \u201cIf he issues a comment on the President\u2019s tweet I will send it your way.\u201d\n\nWe see our elected officials speaking out vehemently against racism regularly, yet very few have condemned Trump\u2019s racist rants against Natives. Raine Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes under President Barack Obama\n\nOne House leader did speak up. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), chair of the Democratic Caucus, questioned when any Republicans will ever denounce Trump.\n\n\u201cTrail of tears massacre is part of Native American genocide perpetrated against millions of indigenous people,\u201d Jeffries tweeted Monday. \u201cMocking this shameful episode is a hateful trope.\u201d\n\nTrump chose the picture of Jackson for the Oval Office and has said that he is \u201ca fan\u201d of Jackson\u2019s populism.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Here's Trump standing with Native American veterans in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office. He attacked Elizabeth Warren as \"Pocahontas\" at this event.\n\nOn Friday, Trump made a reference to a conservative pundit going \u201coff the reservation,\u201d yet another phrase offensive to at least some Native people.\n\nElected leaders may be understandably reluctant to wade into Trump\u2019s criticisms of Warren, and it would be essentially impossible to respond to every offensive tweet the president fires off. But if they\u2019re not willing to tease apart the difference between Trump attacking Warren versus his slurs and mockery of Native people and culture, it means the president gets away with normalizing racist language in the name of a joke or a campaign attack.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it\u2019s not the Massachusetts senator bearing the brunt of those attacks. It\u2019s indigenous people, over and over again.\n\nPeople in positions of power have a responsibility to call out Trump every time he dehumanizes Native people, said Mary Kathryn Nagle, an attorney and Cherokee Nation citizen. She noted the contrast between the recent widespread condemnation of Virginia elected officials for wearing blackface and the relative silence in response to Trump\u2019s apparent mocking of the Trail of Tears.\n\n\u201cThe effect of that silence is incredibly traumatic, especially for our kids, because when they see that, OK, everyone is upset about blackface but no one is upset that apparently the genocide of my people is a joke? What does that mean about me and my worth as a human being?\u201d Nagle said.\n\nThe president\u2019s attacks on Native people have the equally distressing effect of erasing the stories of real people, she added. Trump is using indigenous people \u201cas characters, as almost cartoons in a political feud,\u201d she said, and that \u201cgives the American public the implicit permission to do that to the actual Native people living here.\u201d\n\nNagle\u2019s take echoes the findings of a groundbreaking, multi-year study conducted by Native researchers that surveyed how the American public views indigenous people. They found that the vast majority of Americans learn about Native people only through pop culture and media, where Native Americans are barely represented \u2014 and when they are, it is typically in the context of racist team mascots for sports teams or stereotypes. Just 13 percent of state history curriculum standards about indigenous people cover events past the year 1900, which means most Americans have no concept of contemporary Native American people.\n\nThe fact that Americans are taught a distorted version of history early on \u2015 one that glosses over the atrocities the U.S. committed against indigenous people \u2015 makes it easier for them not to feel guilty about the country\u2019s history of mass genocide and to keep Native people in the margins, said Dr. Arianne Eason, one of the project\u2019s researchers.\n\n\u201cUntil we start unpacking that, we can live in this space where omission feels OK. It assuages our guilt,\u201d Eason said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to feel bad about what\u2019s happening and contend with a group of people saying literally in our faces, \u2018We are still here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat he\u2019s willing to so casually invoke the darkest chapter of American history to take a cheap shot at a rival, I was flabbergasted. Candessa Tehee, assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Northeastern State University\n\nAdrienne Keene, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and assistant professor of American studies and ethnic studies at Brown University, tweeted that every time she hears \u201cPocahontas\u201d or \u201cLie-awatha\u201d or \u201cchief\u201d jokes, it\u2019s a reminder of how close to the surface and accessible these stereotypes are.\n\n\u201cThese \u2018jokes\u2019 show me that most Americans don\u2019t think of Native folks as your neighbors, your professors, your friends, or your fellow citizens,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump has given no indication that he\u2019s listening to Native communities or their concerns when he goes after Warren. To the contrary, he treats \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2015 a name he has called Warren at least 18 times on Twitter alone \u2015 as a clever insult.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has tried to defend Trump for invoking Pocahontas\u2019 name when attacking Warren by arguing that her name is not a racial slur.\n\nBut Pocahontas was a real Powhatan woman \u201cwhose life was cut short in a terrible way,\u201d as Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) has put it. \u201cWhen I think of that story \u2014 and the hundreds of sad and disturbing stories of how Native people have suffered throughout history, I can\u2019t imagine making a mockery of their names or their lives,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt may seem futile to try to stop Trump\u2019s racist comments about Native people or any other group. But the way people in positions of power respond to him when he does \u2015 or when they don\u2019t respond at all \u2015 arguably matters more.\n\nTrump may never get the message that Native Americans aren\u2019t a mascot or political joke, Nagle said, but hopefully, the next generation will learn \u201cthat what Trump is doing is wrong, and they shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lynn-hutchings-homosexuality-bestiality-wyoming-students_us_5c638fdae4b03de94296bdea": "Democrats in Wyoming are calling for a Republican state lawmaker to resign after she reportedly compared homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia during a conversation with a group of high school students.\n\nState Sen.

I want to make it clear that my conversation was not intended to demean these students.\u201d\n\nJoe Barbuto, chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party, lambasted Hutchings\u2019 alleged remarks, calling them \u201cindefensible, insensitive, and repugnant.\u201d\n\nHe called for the lawmaker\u2019s immediate resignation.\n\nTop Republican state lawmakers, including Perkins, said Monday that they are looking into the students\u2019 complaint against Hutchings.\n\n\u201cIn Wyoming, we believe in respect, civility and compassion.

Being \u201cdomiciled\u201d is legally different from being a \u201cresident.\u201d The state legally defines a resident as someone who intends to remain in the state \u201cfor the indefinite future.\u201d\n\nThe new measure, HB 1264, which is set to take effect on July 1, removes the phrase \u201cfor the indefinite future\u201d from the definition of resident and makes it identical to the definition of domiciled. Thus, anyone claiming to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d in order to be eligible to vote is also saying they are a resident and is then obligated to required to get a driver\u2019s license and register their car within 60 days.\n\nThe ACLU says the change is unconstitutional because it imposes a needless and unnecessary burden on college students and others who don\u2019t plan to stay in the state permanently but want to vote there. The civil liberties group says the measure violates the First and 14th amendments because the state hasn\u2019t \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d the law to advance a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nThey also say it violates the 24th Amendment, which prohibits poll taxes, as well as the 26th Amendment, which grants the right to vote to anyone 18 or older.\n\nJulie Ebenstein, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project, noted New Hampshire lawmakers had been trying for decades to impose similar restrictions on college students\u2019 ability to vote. In 1972, a three-judge panel said a law that barred people who planned to leave a New Hampshire town at some point in the future from voting was unconstitutional. In 2014, a state court struck down a law that explicitly required anyone who registered to vote in New Hampshire to get a state driver\u2019s license and to get their vehicle registered there. That decision was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans passed HB 1264 shortly after Democrat Maggie Hassan defeated Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes for one of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seats in 2016. In the same year, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump in the state. Ebenstein noted the bill passed along party lines in the legislature and that lawmakers appeared to be targeting young voters and college students based on a perception that they supported Democrats.\n\n\u201cCollege students are perceived by legislators as being more liberal or being more left and we know that because the legislators said so. ... Given legislators\u2019 perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe 2016 election was very close in New Hampshire.\u201d She added that because of the state\u2019s small population the 13,000 undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire can make a difference in a close election.\n\nGiven legislators' perception that young people are going to vote and are going to continue to vote a certain way, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re being targeted. Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney, ACLU Voting Rights Project\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, are Caroline Casey and Maggie Flaherty, two sophomores at Dartmouth College who are registered to vote in New Hampshire despite growing up outside the state. Both voted in the 2018 midterm elections there. Neither woman has a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and both intend to leave the state after graduating from college. Neither has a car and said in the complaint filed Wednesday that traveling to the nearest Division of Motor Vehicles would be a burden to them.\n\nIn a July op-ed justifying the law, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) wrote that people can vote in New Hampshire without satisfying the obligations of residents. The new law, he said, would put everyone on \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\nIn an advisory opinion last year, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found 3-2 that the new measure did not violate either the New Hampshire Constitution or the First or 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the law did not amount to a poll tax nor did it target young voters.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the State may legitimately establish procedures by which persons who may be tempted to insincerely claim domicile for voting purposes are discouraged from doing so by the prospect that such a claim can result in their incurring the full panoply of obligations imposed on all other state residents,\u201d the majority wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that states may not condition the right to vote on the payment of a tax or fee,\u201d they continued. \u201cHowever, the opponents of HB 1264 are mistaken when they claim that the bill conditions voting on the payment of motor vehicle fees or taxes. Rather, if a person becomes obligated to pay such fees or taxes, it will not be because the person votes, but because the person owns or drives a motor vehicle and is a resident of this state. Thus, a person who claims domicile in New Hampshire for voting purposes but who does not drive or own a motor vehicle will have no obligation to pay motor vehicle related fees.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images The ACLU is suing New Hampshire over a change in the legal definition of \"resident.\" The change is set to go into effect later this year.\n\nBut Ebenstein said the two students in the case had already shown they were legitimate New Hampshire voters. The state, she said, was essentially adding an additional hurdle for the students to prove they were bona fide residents.\n\n\u201cOur clients, who moved to New Hampshire, been active on campus, been active in their communities, who have already participated in the political process in New Hampshire are fully committed to their state and their role in the local community and certainly do to New Hampshire play a large role in the political conversation and process. That\u2019s most likely why they\u2019re being targeted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with ensuring someone\u2019s eligibility. It\u2019s just once they are eligible, the state can\u2019t put barriers in the way of letting them exercise that right,\u201d she added. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to prove their devotion to New Hampshire by paying fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sununu expressed confidence the law would be upheld:\n\nThis lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate attempt to dredge up arguments that our State Supreme Court already rejected last summer. The Supreme Court addressed each of the legal arguments made by opponents of House Bill 1264 and found that the law ensures that every voter is treated the same. I fully expect our federal court to reach the same conclusion. Given that House Bill 1264 does nothing more than align New Hampshire with virtually every other state in requiring residency in order to vote, the plaintiffs in this suit should be asked whether they plan to file identical lawsuits in every other state.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Sununu.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-grassley-mitch-mcconnell-national-emergency_n_5c660c69e4b01757c369ce17": "An irritable Sen.

Ted Cruz ended in defeat but dramatically altered Texas politics by spurring a surge in turnout along the border and narrowing the Republican margin of victory in a key statewide race to less than 3 percentage points. His ability to get new voters to the polls and out-fundraise his opponent without accepting PAC money stoked enthusiasm for a presidential run even before the U.S. Senate race ended. He recently said he would make a decision on a presidential bid later this month.\n\nBut, save a few public appearances, he remained largely out of the spotlight until Trump cast his sights on El Paso.\n\nTrump cited El Paso in his State of the Union speech last week as evidence of the need for border wall funding, inaccurately claiming that the city was among the country\u2019s most violent until the federal government began fencing it off from its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. (In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nTrump is expected to make further exaggerations on Monday evening in hopes of winning support for $5.7 billion to begin building a border wall. His impasse with Congress over the funding led to the recent 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, El Paso officials and community leaders will try to present the city as they know it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to follow the community\u2019s lead....

Kirsten Gillibrand (above) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro plan to reintroduce the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act.\n\nThe U.S. is inching closer to a paid family leave policy this year, catching up to essentially every other country in the world.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) plan to reintroduce the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, a bill that would guarantee 12 weeks of partially paid leave for new parents and for workers who need to care for sick family members or are experiencing serious health issues.\n\n\u201cThere is very serious momentum,\u201d DeLauro told HuffPost, explaining why this year is different. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new Congress, we\u2019ve got the largest majority of women and young people.\u201d Finally, family leave is at the \u201ccenter of the debate, rather than the fringes,\u201d she added.\n\nDeLauro and Gillibrand first introduced the bill in 2013. But this year they have a Democratic majority in the House, where it\u2019s expected to pass.\n\nMeanwhile, paid leave is gaining traction with conservatives who have long opposed such efforts. President Donald Trump, pressured by his daughter Ivanka, actually proposed a paid maternity leave policy, though most advocates say it falls short in a couple of key respects.\n\nDespite the growing support for paid leave, the bill would face an extreme uphill climb in the U.S. Senate.\n\nA record 29 percent of candidates running in 2018 put paid leave policies on their platforms, up from just 4 percent in 2014, said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies at the National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s time,\u201d Shabo said. \u201cWe\u2019re the only country that doesn\u2019t provide paid leave for new moms. And one of a handful that don\u2019t provide paid time off at all for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe Family Act, as the legislation is known, would allow all workers in the U.S. to earn 66 percent of their monthly wages, up to a certain maximum, funded by a small payroll tax of two-tenths of 1 percent paid for by employers and employees. And advocates say they might tweak the bill further so that lower-income workers are able to earn a higher percentage of their pay.\n\nThe bill is modeled on similar legislation that\u2019s proved successful in a handful of states. California has been offering paid leave for more than a decade, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York also have plans in effect.\n\nContrary to initial dire warnings from conservatives, paid leave has had little to no effect on businesses in these states. In California, the vast majority of business owners said they weren\u2019t affected negatively by the bills, according to one widely cited survey. Indeed, for the few companies that already offer paid leave, the legislation would offset some of its costs.\n\nCurrently, the United States offers 12 weeks unpaid leave for some workers through the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was passed 26 years ago.\n\nCrucially, the Family Act would give paid time off to those who are sick or need to care for a sick relative. President Trump\u2019s proposal would leave those folks out.\n\nFidel Hernandez, who works in fulfillment for Amazon in Kenosha, Wisconsin, desperately needed time off to care for his sick mother last year. Maria Hernandez, 65, works for a subcontractor that provides janitorial services to Amazon. She collapsed at work because of a diabetes-related issue and needed time off to recover and heal. Fidel, who lives with his mom, wanted to help cook, clean and care for her.\n\nNeither of them could get any paid time off. Maria Hernandez took six months unpaid. Her son kept working 10-hour days. And they had trouble getting by, forced to rely on donations from a food pantry, emergency savings and some money from their local church.\n\n\u201cIt hurt me that I could not be there for my mom,\u201d Fidel Hernandez, who is deaf, said in a statement he plans to give Tuesday when Gillibrand, DeLauro and paid leave advocates reintroduce the bill. \u201cAfter working 10 hours a day, I would drive home through construction traffic and all I could think about is, \u2018Is my mom OK?

Elizabeth Warren officially announced her presidential bid near the banks of the Merrimack River here on Saturday, picking a highly symbolic location that points to both long, worker-centric political tradition Warren seeks to inherit and the challenge she might face in winning over an increasingly diverse Democratic party.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way,\u201d Warren said at the Everett Mills, where a group of Polish women walked off the job in January 1912, setting off the famous Bread and Roses Strike, when tens of thousands of immigrant workers united to shut down the city\u2019s textile mills for the winter, winning substantial raises and safer work conditions.\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Elizabeth Warren is done exploring. She's running for president.\n\nWarren\u2019s official entry into the race to win the Democratic nod to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 has been expected since she announced the formation of an exploratory committee in late December. She joins a field that already includes three of her fellow Democratic senators \u2015 New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker, California\u2019s Kamala Harris and New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand \u2015 and could soon include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, along with a host of other candidates.\n\nShe launched her campaign with an introduction from Rep. Joe Kennedy III, winning the blessing of the highest-profile member of the first family of Democratic politics, and with the backing of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and fellow Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole,\u201d said Kennedy, a former student of Warren\u2019s at Harvard Law School. \u201cA leader that will bring us together to confront our great threat: A system that protects the powerful and the privileged.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a practical reason to announce in Lawrence \u2015 it\u2019s a quick, 10-minute drive to New Hampshire, which hosts the first-in-the-nation primary \u2015 but the symbolic reasons to choose the former mill town 40 minutes north of Boston instead of a more prominent locale are stronger. The Bread and Roses Strike, which was led in large part by women, immigrants and immigrant women, is a rich historical text for Warren to invoke during a speech announcing her bid. It allows Warren to connect to a landmark moment in labor history, and it also links her directly to one of just a handful of majority-minority cities in her home state, giving her a chance to show her appeal to the voters who may ultimately decide the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about immigrants, it\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about workers\u2019 rights, it\u2019s about pay equity,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s about everything Elizabeth Warren has spent her life fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe Bread and Roses strike began in response to a pay cut of 32 cents a week. The roughly 30,000 people who worked in the mills were crowded into tenement houses, having arrived in Lawrence from more than 50 different nations. Seven of eight people who worked in the mills were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. At the city\u2019s dominant employer \u2015 the American Woolen Company \u2015 half of the employees were women between the ages of 14 and 18. While doctors in Lawrence had a life expectancy of 65, more than one-third of mill workers died before age 25.\n\nThe strike quickly led to clashes with local police, and a state militia was called in. The Industrial Workers of the World organized the strikers, and soon news of the strike was dominating the nation\u2019s newspapers. Wealthy suffragettes, believing their struggle for the right to vote was linked to that of the strikers, began supporting them financially. To draw additional attention to the cause, the mothers of Lawrence sent their children by train to New York City, a so-called \u201cChildren\u2019s Exodus.\u201d The sight of the malnourished children drew more sympathy to the strikers\u2019 cause. In late February, as a second group of children prepared to leave for Philadelphia, police began clubbing them and their parents. The violence drew further condemnation, and soon both the U.S. House and Senate began investigating the conditions in Lawrence.\n\nIn March, owners agreed to a 15 percent raise for the mill workers, to give double pay for overtime and to improve safety conditions in the mills. The eventual agreement ending the strike was read aloud in Arabic, Polish, Armenian and a slew of other languages, reflecting the diversity of the strikers.\n\nJournalist Bruce Watson, in his book on the strike, \u201cBread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream,\u201d wrote that in 1912, \u201cthe great rudder of a stable society, the middle class, had not yet been invented.\u201d But within months of the end of the strike, Warren noted, Massachusetts became the first state in the country with a minimum wage, part of a newly empowered labor movement that would soon win a 40-hour work week and the elimination of child labor.\n\nIn Warren\u2019s telling of American history, the middle class that the strike helped create over the following decades has fallen by the wayside. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident. It wasn\u2019t inevitable,\u201d she said, pointing the finger at power-hungry lobbyists, misguided Republicans and the corrupting influence of corporate money on politics that she said had derailed progress on everything from gun control to climate change. \u201cOver the years, America\u2019s middle class had been deliberately hollowed out.\u201d\n\nTo fix it, Warren argues, involves more than throwing Trump out of office, and requires a more aggressive form of liberal politics. \u201cToday, millions and millions and millions of American families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well-connected,\u201d she said during her 40-minute speech. \u201cCorruption is a cancer on our democracy. And we will get rid of it only with strong medicine \u2015 with real, structural reform.\u201d\n\nBut Lawrence\u2019s story is as much about immigration as it is about labor. \u201cThe city of Lawrence symbolizes what our country stands for. The wave after wave of immigrants who come to this country seeking a better life,\u201d said Juana Matias, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who previously represented Lawrence in the Massachusetts State House. \u201cWarren coming to Lawrence demonstrates the commitment she has to the middle class.\u201d\n\nInstead of the polyglot immigrant community that existed in 1912, Lawrence today is dominated by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and emigres from Puerto Rico. The city, which is nearly three-quarters Latino in a state that is roughly three-quarters white, has struggled. A 2014 story in Boston Magazine labeled it \u201cThe City of the Damned,\u201d documenting a state takeover of the city\u2019s failing public schools, a high crime rate and the corruption investigations plaguing its then-mayor, William Lantigua.\n\nIt has also become a favorite target of Republican attacks. In a 2018 speech in New Hampshire, Trump blamed Lawrence and Boston by name for the deadly opioid epidemic ravaging New England. Chris Sununu, New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor, has used similar rhetoric. Most famously, former Maine Gov. Paul LePage blamed his state\u2019s problems with fentanyl on black and Latino people from Lawrence and nearby Lowell.\n\nMatias said things are improving in the city, with better schools and less crime under new mayor Daniel Rivera, who spoke before Warren. A small number of biotech and other firms have moved into the massive mill buildings along the river, but the city remains one of the poorest in the state.\n\nLawrence\u2019s large Latino population \u2015 Trump signaled it out because of its status as sanctuary city where local police don\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2015 also provides Warren with an opportunity to show her appeal to voters of color. Massachusetts\u2019 limited number of black and Latino voters means Warren still needs to show she can appeal to voters outside her core base of white progressives.\n\nAfter making her way onstage to Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201c9 to 5,\u201d Warren ticked off a host of policy priorities \u2015 from making it easier to join a union to outlawing gerrymandering to criminal justice reform, but repeatedly returned to her core message of rebuilding the middle class, which she emphasized could appeal to voters across the socioeconomic spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe come from different backgrounds, different religions, different languages, different experiences,\u201d she told the crowd of roughly 3,500 people who braved freezing temperatures to attend the rally. \u201cWe feel the urgency of this moment in different ways. But today, we come together, ready to raise our voices until this fight is won.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Warren is set to travel to New Hampshire and then Iowa this weekend, and she has trips to South Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and California planned for the coming weeks.\n\nRepublicans responded to Warren\u2019s campaign launch by focusing on the controversy over the senator\u2019s claims to Native American ancestry, which gained new steam this week after The Washington Post reported she identified as Native American on a form filed with the Texas State Bar.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has already been exposed as a fraud by the Native Americans she impersonated and disrespected to advance her professional career, and the people of Massachusetts she deceived to get elected,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nBut there is no evidence Warren\u2019s ancestry claims helped her advance her career, and little evidence it will significantly hamper her in the Democratic primary. National and state-level polls place her in the middle of a crowded field. Most have the best-known candidates, Biden and Sanders, leading the field.\n\nThis story has been updated with more details from Warren\u2019s announcement.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicaid-michigan-whitmer-verma-gop_us_5c5dcaffe4b0910c63f035db": "Between 61,000 and 183,000 low-income residents of Michigan are likely to lose government-provided health insurance next year, thanks to new Medicaid rules the state Republican legislature passed last summer and that the newly elected Democratic governor now wants those lawmakers to amend.\n\nThe changes apply to people who got Medicaid because of Michigan\u2019s expansion of the program, in 2014, when the state tapped federal dollars available through the Affordable Care Act and opened enrollment to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line. Under new requirements set to take effect in January 2020, those beneficiaries must demonstrate they are working at least 20 hours a week, trying to find work or unable to work.\n\nSupporters, including GOP leaders in the legislature, say the new requirement and reporting regimen will encourage people to find jobs \u2015 and that, more fundamentally, it\u2019s wrong to demand taxpayers subsidize health care for people who could find employment but don\u2019t.\n\nBut most people who got coverage through the Medicaid expansion are either working already or cannot hold jobs, because they are caring for others or have serious conditions of their own, studies have shown repeatedly. And in Arkansas, which imposed work requirements last year, more than 18,000 people lost their coverage for failing to comply.\n\nIf local reporting and available data are indicative, people aren\u2019t generally losing coverage because these people actually failed to meet the work requirement or lack qualifying hardships. Instead, they are losing coverage because they had difficulty navigating the complex reporting requirements.\n\nAdvocates for the poor worry the same thing will soon happen in Michigan, only on an even larger scale, and that it probably won\u2019t stop there.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's newly elected Democratic governor, is urging the GOP state legislature to roll back Medicaid work requirements slated to take effect next year.\n\nThe federal Medicaid law, which dates back to 1965, requires that states seeking major changes get special permission from the federal government. The Obama administration looked askance at work requirements on the theory that they could harm beneficiaries, which would be a clear violation of the Medicaid statute.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a different attitude, approving seven such applications, including Michigan\u2019s, with another eight now pending.\n\nSeema Verma, chief administrator of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been a vocal proponent of the work requirements \u2015 arguing last year that they are \u201cnot some subversive attempt to just kick people off of Medicaid \u2026 their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.\u201d\n\nBut there is scant evidence that work requirements encourage people to find employment. If anything, the evidence suggests the opposite \u2015 that Medicaid coverage makes it easier for people to find and hold on to jobs, most likely because they don\u2019t have to worry about medical problems that would make work difficult.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not clear how much the Trump administration cares about what happens to the people who lose Medicaid \u2015 or whether it cares at all. Among the first states to get the administration\u2019s go-ahead for work requirements, not a single one of them had created systems for checking whether people losing coverage end up in better jobs or with better health, according to an investigation that the Los Angeles Times published this week.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to look at the requirements and not see them as part of a broader, more general assault on government-financed health insurance \u2015 an assault that is still ongoing, all across the country, even though GOP efforts to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d were perhaps the single biggest reason Republicans suffered such a devastating rebuke at the polls in the midterm elections.\n\nMichigan, a state that was pivotal in Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential victory, was actually one of the states where Republicans fared worse. They lost a pair of closely contested congressional races along with the top statewide offices, up to and including governor.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, the state senator who would eventually win that contest, attacked her GOP opponent for supporting repeal of the Affordable Care Act. She also touted her role in getting the Medicaid expansion through the state legislature.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Seema Verma, who oversees Medicaid for the Trump administration, has urged states to impose work requirements on Medicaid \u2014 and approved several applications to do so.\n\nMichigan has been a case study in what the expansion can accomplish. Approximately 680,000 residents now have health insurance through the expansion, and as a result they are more likely to get medical care (like treatment for heart conditions) and less likely to experience financial distress (like running up credit card debts), according to studies by researchers at the University of Michigan.\n\nBut Michigan\u2019s legislature, where gerrymandering has given conservative Republicans extra clout, resisted the expansion for years, even though the former two-term governor, Republican Rick Snyder, was in favor.\n\nWith Snyder on his way out of office last year, because of term limits, and the GOP\u2019s hold on that position in clear jeopardy, the legislature passed (and Snyder eventually signed) legislation creating the work requirements. That legislation included a \u201ctrigger\u201d provision that would have rolled back the expansion altogether if the federal government didn\u2019t give approval, which it did pending confirmation and a few minor modifications from the state.\n\nOn Friday, Whitmer provided the Trump administration with that confirmation, setting the stage for the work requirements to start next January. But in the official letter, Whitmer repeated some of the objections she had made as a candidate \u2015 and cited a new analysis, from the national consulting firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips, projecting that Arkansas-level effects would mean 183,000 people on Medicaid losing their insurance, or more than a quarter of the people who got coverage through the expansion.\n\n\u201cThe effect of these coverage losses on individuals\u2019 health and financial security is sobering to contemplate,\u201d Whitmer wrote. \u201cAs in Arkansas, Michigan\u2019s new law provides no resources for job training, job search, or job supports. There is no reason to expect better job outcomes.\u201d\n\nIt will be up to the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services to put in place the new system for beneficiaries to report their work status. But while Michigan already has a well-developed online portal for public benefits, Robert Gordon, the new state secretary of health and human services, said he too worries about a replay of the Arkansas experience \u2015 with people losing coverage even when they are following the rules when it comes to employment.\n\n\u201cWhether or not they make sense in principle, we know what happens with work requirements,\u201d Gordon told HuffPost. \u201cPeople don\u2019t get information on how to comply, they don\u2019t understand how they are supposed to comply, they try to comply and are not able to, or they comply and government makes a mistake and doesn\u2019t realize it.\u201d\n\nWhitmer campaigned for governor as somebody who could get things done, like \u201cfixing the damn roads,\u201d by citing her history of bipartisan work in the state senate. But GOP lawmakers are already pushing to block or overturn some of her early moves, including a rollback of Snyder-era changes that give business groups more sway over environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cAlthough the governor says she is committed to partnering with the legislature, she first makes us aware of her intent to water down Michigan\u2019s thoughtful Medicaid work requirements via a press release,\u201d Mike Shirkey, Republican leader in the state Senate, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI will be an active listener and participant in discussions with my governor, but I wholeheartedly believe the work requirement is necessary for Healthy Michigan to continue to function,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans believe, rightly or wrongly, that work requirements are popular. Whether they reconsider the Medicaid changes could depend in part on whether they face political pressure \u2015 say, from from advocates for the poor or the health care industry, and the governor as well.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-iowa-caucus-democrats-love-progressive-patriotism_us_5c6056f2e4b0f9e1b17e458b": "WATERLOO, Iowa \u2015 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s favorite presidential campaign-trail yarn \u2015 and he has a lot of them \u2015 is about how his parents, two of IBM\u2019s first black executives, overcame housing market discrimination to raise him and his brother in a predominantly white neighborhood in one of his state\u2019s suburbs.\n\n\n\nAs an adult, Booker likes to recall, he asked Arthur Lessman, the white lawyer who helped his parents outsmart a racist real estate agent, why the attorney was inspired to do it. It turned out that Lessman had volunteered his services after watching television one day in 1965 when the normal programming was interrupted by breaking footage of Alabama state troopers brutally bludgeoning black civil rights activists marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.\n\n\n\nRecounting the tale Friday afternoon to an audience of about 100 Democrats at a community college in Waterloo, Booker marveled at the far-reaching power of individual political sacrifices. It\u2019s a testament, he declared with excitement in his voice, to his deeply held belief that \u201clove is a radical force.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe marchers in Selma \u201cstood up for love of country and unleashed that energy and it instantaneously leapt a thousand miles and changed the heart of one man on a couch in New Jersey, who then would go on and change generations not yet born,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here right now because of that chain reaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same weekend that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to \u201cfight back\u201d against the \u201cclass warfare\u201d waged by the super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort.\n\n\n\nRather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy \u2015 an \u201cus\u201d against a proverbial \u201cthem\u201d \u2015 Booker focuses almost entirely on the \u201cus\u201d \u2015 on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement.\n\n\n\nBooker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States\u2019 forefathers \u201cimperfect geniuses\u201d for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not.\n\nI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it. Tom Swartz, former Iowa state representative, referring to Booker\n\nIn this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman\u2019s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism.\n\n\u201cIf we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,\u201d he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Booker\u2019s appeals to America\u2019s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders\u2019 work of forming a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama\u2019s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job.\n\nOn Booker\u2019s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it,\u201d said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown.\n\nAfter the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren\u2019s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.)\n\nBut Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump\u2019s invective.\n\n\u201cIt probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,\u201d Blaisdell said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Charlie Neibergall Booker minged with voters at the First Congregational United Church of Christ on Friday in Mason City, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I Had To Run Something\u2019\n\nBooker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders \u2015 which includes several of his Senate colleagues. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have announced their candidacies; Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs.\n\nBooker, whose mother\u2019s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party\u2019s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cMy story is your story,\u201d he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class.\n\nBooker tells story of his Iowa roots. His ancestors moved from Alabama to mining town of Buxton; grandmother grew up in Des Moines. pic.twitter.com/lnrwamvd3V \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nMany of the Iowans who came to hear Booker speak knew him already from his dramatic, televised confrontations with Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s confirmation hearings last year.\n\nHe burnished his credentials among many Democrats when he released a memo Kavanaugh had written on racial profiling after the Republican-controlled committee refused to publicize it and barred Booker from questioning the nominee about it. On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a \u201cSpartacus moment,\u201d a reference that left observers quizzical.\n\nRegardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI had to run something,\u201d Booker said in Marshalltown. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nThe experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate.\n\nBooker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing.\n\nGrassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country\u2019s system of law enforcement and incarceration.\n\nRather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\u201cSome people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. \u201cWell, I ran a fire department. That\u2019s not going to be a constructive strategy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Susan Walsh Booker cajoles Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to join him in an Instagram Live post in December. Looking on is Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nShrugging Off Criticism From The Left\n\nOf course, Booker\u2019s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term \u201cWall Street\u201d \u2015 a favorite target of attack among his party\u2019s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.)\n\nIn his efforts to improve Newark\u2019s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good.\n\nBooker\u2019s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies.\n\nIn addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago.\n\nBooker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations.\n\nIn Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools.\n\nTime and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities.\n\nRather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor.\n\n\u201cI was like Malcolm X \u2014 by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,\u201d he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening.\n\nAt the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren.\n\nHe admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high. But rather than lower it to 21 percent from 35 percent, as the GOP measure did, he would have left it at 25 or 26 percent.\n\nAnd in a conversation that night about climate policy in Iowa City, he described nuclear energy as part of the solution.\n\nMore on climate change: He supports nuclear energy and thinks any climate bill must be bipartisan (unless there\u2019s a 60-vote Senate due to \u201cblue tsunami\u201d). This is at supporter\u2019s home in Iowa City. pic.twitter.com/GkkUZVa4E2 \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nBooker was keen to emphasize that action on what he sees as the country\u2019s most urgent priorities \u2015 such as universal health coverage and addressing climate change \u2015 would require either compromise with Republicans or a \u201cblue tsunami\u201d big enough to grant Democrats a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.\n\nBooker is a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation, which would replace private health insurance with a federal single-payer program. But on two occasions in Iowa, he suggested that the bill is an aspiration unlikely to be realized in the near future, given the constraints of GOP numbers in the Senate.\n\nSingle-payer health care \u201cis a goal we should shoot at,\u201d he told a crowd of 500 people at Kum & Go Theater in Des Moines on Saturday.\n\nIn the interim, he proposed backing a Medicare buy-in or lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age to 55 or 50.\n\nWhat Booker did not volunteer in his discussion is that he not only opposes efforts to abolish the filibuster in the Senate, he has promised to personally defend the practice if it came under assault.\n\nStill, many of the Democrats who attended Booker\u2019s events seemed either unaware of Booker\u2019s deviations from progressive orthodoxy or relatively unbothered by it after hearing him speak.\n\nShawn Harmsen, a 46-year-old journalism professor, hosted a campaign gathering for Booker at his home in Iowa City, where he prominently displayed a blue \u201cI [heart] public educators\u201d sign on his front lawn. Harmsen wants to know more about Booker\u2019s support for charter schools, but held out the possibility that such educational alternatives might be acceptable in circumstances \u201cwhere you have minority communities who are tired of waiting for the public school system.\u201d\n\nRoberta Rosheim, a 69-year-old retired school teacher and union activist, and her husband, David, 74, a seller of rare books, went into Booker\u2019s Des Moines town hall skeptical. Roberta had read about his support for charter schools and his past receipt of pharmaceutical industry money.\n\nBut Roberta said they emerged \u201cimpressed.\u201d\n\nDavid added, \u201cI thought he came out very much for public education.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-woods-calls-ocasio-cortez-most-dangerous-person-in-america_us_5c410ea9e4b0bfa693c173b5": "Rep.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) delivered a response to Trump's border wall speech shortly after Democratic leaders offered their own rebuke of the president's address.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called climate change \u201cthe biggest crisis of all\u201d in a fiery rebuke of President Donald Trump\u2019s televised address Tuesday night meant to drum up support for funding a U.S.-Mexico border wall to reopen the federal government.\n\nSpeaking shortly after Trump\u2019s prime-time Oval Office speech, Sanders listed the 30 million Americans without health insurance, the millions of senior citizens in \u201cdesperate poverty\u201d and the 40 million young Americans \u201ctrying to deal with outrageous debt\u201d as issues meriting a White House declaration of a national emergency.\n\nBut the Vermont senator and likely 2020 presidential candidate said human-caused global warming should top the president\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cThe scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMr. President, we don\u2019t need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Nov. 15, 2018 photo, smoke hangs over the scorched remains of Old Town Plaza following the devastating wildfire in Paradise, California.\n\nThe clarion call capped off Sanders\u2019 roughly nine-minute response and stood in stark contrast to the humdrum address the two top Democrats in Congress gave immediately after Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nIn a response aired on nearly every major network, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the president of using \u201cthe backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration\u201d and of \u201cholding hostage critical services for the health, safety and wellbeing of the American people.\u201d They made no mention of climate change.\n\nThe two Democratic leaders, who were standing soberly side by side, drew mockery for appearing like two proverbial parents expressing disappointment with a misbehaving teen.\n\nIf that official Democratic response was meant to demonstrate the poise and civility that plays well with the Beltway crowd, Sanders\u2019 seemed targeted at average American voters.\n\nHe opened with a list of people victimized by the three-week shutdown of the federal government, including \u201cthe disabled, their children and the elderly\u201d on food stamps, small businesses and farmers owed financial assistance, and would-be homeowners or sellers awaiting the processing of mortgage applications. (He didn\u2019t mention, however, that the Trump administration has continued processing oil and gas drilling permits, according to Bloomberg.)\n\nMr. President, we don\u2019t need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nThen, Sanders recalled the Senate bill to fund the government that passed unanimously on Dec. 19 and said it was \u201cwidely expected\u201d that the next day, \u201cthe House would do the same\u201d and \u201cthe government would remain open.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, President Trump, who started receiving criticism from an assortment of right-wing ideologues, changed his mind about the agreement,\u201d Sanders said. He then read aloud quotes in which Trump said he is \u201cproud to shut down the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of the shutdown, President Trump has made it very clear who was responsible,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nIn the middle of his speech, Sanders called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly, saying, \u201clet\u2019s vote to end the shutdown now in a bipartisan way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time,\u201d Sanders said, his voice rising. \u201cIn his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie.\u201d\n\nSanders stopped short of denouncing the president\u2019s repeated statements that call the science behind global warming into question.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) asked Whitaker whether he was involved in the January decision of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to alter an established legal interpretation of the Federal Wire Act in order to further limit online gambling and whether he had any communications with Adelson or any of the billionaire\u2019s lobbyists. The new opinion reversed a 2011 OLC interpretation of the act that had applied a prohibition on online gambling strictly to online betting on sports. State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.\n\nWhitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson.\n\n\u201cYour inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,\u201d the acting attorney general said.\n\nRaskin was not satisfied with Whitaker\u2019s answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThis definitely bears further investigation,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWhen and where and by whom remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Jamie Raskin questions acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker at a congressional hearing on Feb. 8, 2019.\n\nThe investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLC\u2019s sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.\n\nSheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.\n\nMore recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.\n\nThe revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNow some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should \u201cwithdraw its opinion\u201d because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.\n\nBesides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senate\u2019s confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trump\u2019s choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sheldon Adelson attends a White House ceremony to see his wife, Miriam, receive the Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in November 2018.\n\nSince 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation \u2015 which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore \u2015 has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.\n\nSo Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesn\u2019t campaign on the grounds that Adelson\u2019s hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.\n\nThe Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal.

In order to get a bill out of Congress and onto Trump\u2019s desk by Feb. 15, work on a funding bill needs to start within the next 24 hours. As a result, there could be a push for another short-term funding bill while efforts continue to reach a final deal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019re going to get there,\u201d Shelby said, estimating the current odds of a deal at \u201c50-50.\u201c\n\nEven then, it remains unclear whether Trump will accept whatever solution comes out of Congress. He has been threatening for months to declare a \u201cnational emergency\u201d and divert money from other programs to build hundreds of miles of wall along the Mexican border if Congress does not appropriate $5.7 billion for the project.\n\nThe White House has not taken the threat off the table despite substantial opposition to the national emergency idea from many Republicans in Congress.

And he broke with tradition when he took office without divesting from his businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for congressional committees to conduct oversight of the executive branch, but Trump said during his State of the Union address on Tuesday that Democrats should lay off.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWays and Means can obtain anyone\u2019s tax returns under a provision of the tax code. This provision has existed since the 1920s, when Congress enabled three congressional committees to obtain the president\u2019s tax returns without the chief executive\u2019s consent. Those committees can then release those tax returns to the full House or Senate if they choose. The Joint Committee on Taxation famously did so in 1974 when it sent its report on President Richard Nixon\u2019s tax returns to the House.\n\nIn 2014, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee used their authority under the same provision to obtain the tax information of several private groups that were seeking nonprofit status from the IRS. They then voted to release that information publicly in a letter that sought criminal prosecution of a former IRS official for allegedly targeting conservative groups for audits.\n\nBrady and Kelly were members of Ways and Means in 2014, as were several other Republicans currently on the committee.\n\nAt the hearing, a panel of four expert witnesses testified that the committee has broad authority to request tax returns from the president or anyone else. But Republicans argued the committee had no need to obtain Trump\u2019s returns because the IRS is mandated to audit them and the president already has to make other financial disclosures.\n\nThe witnesses, however, argued that Congress sought Nixon\u2019s tax returns because they did not trust the IRS to properly audit the president\u2019s taxes without undue influence, and because tax returns contain different information than what\u2019s required by mandatory financial disclosures.\n\nRepresentatives for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have said he would review any requests \u201cfor legality,\u201d suggesting the Trump administration would defy Congress \u2015 and defy the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any wiggle room in the statute for the secretary to refuse a request,\u201d George Yin, a tax expert at the University of Virginia Law School, testified.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-money_us_5c59d656e4b00187b5558da0": "Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had the best fundraising quarter of her life in 2018, boosted in part by her decision to support Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.\n\nCollins raised $1.8 million in the last quarter of the year, but just $19,000 of that money came in itemized donations \u2015 contributions of $200 or more \u2015 from residents of Maine.\n\nIn contrast, $32,000 came from public advocates of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, according to a review by the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century. For the most part, these people donated on the same day or after Collins\u2019 Oct. 5 announcement that she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, even though he faced sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nSome of the donations she received:\n\n$2,700 from Alicia Downs on Oct. 5. Downs signed an August 2018 letter of women who worked with Kavanaugh in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House.\n\n$2,700 from Peter Kalis on Oct. 5. Kalis signed a July 2018 letter from Yale students, alumni and faculty backing Kavanaugh.\n\n$5,400 from Laura Cox Kaplan on Nov. 2. Cox Kaplan gave two donations of $2,700 to Collins on the same day. She and her husband, Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s public policy chief, are friends of Kavanaugh. Cox Kaplan sat behind Kavanaugh during his hearing and spoke at an #IStandWithBrett press conference.\n\n$18,450 from 16 other women who signed the Bush White House letter. In addition to Downs, 16 other women who signed the August 2018 letter of women who worked with Kavanaugh in the White House gave to Collins between Oct. 19 and Dec. 31.

Four women \u2015 Julie DeVol, Meghan McCaleb, Ann Fowler and Suzanne Matan \u2015 who signed a Sept. 14 letter from women who knew Kavanaugh in high school also donated to Collins\u2019 campaign between Oct. 19 and Oct. 30, in amounts ranging from $250 to $1,000.\n\n\u201cFor all the talk about Collins\u2019s record-setting quarter, the reality is that she raised more money from Kavanaugh sympathizers than she did from the people she\u2019s supposed to be representing,\u201d said Amelia Penniman, a spokeswoman for Bridge. \u201cThat fact speaks volumes and underscores exactly why her days in the Senate are numbered.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019 office did not return a request for comment. But Amy Abbott, the deputy treasurer of her campaign committee, earlier said that the high amount of out-of-state contributions was deliberate.\n\n\u201cWe made an effort to have a strong quarter because we wanted to send the message that Senator Collins will be prepared to run a vigorous campaign in 2020,\u201d Abbott told the Bangor Daily News, which had reported on the fundraising totals. \u201cWe focused our fundraising efforts nationally, which we typically do until the election year, which is why there were relatively fewer donations from Maine.\u201d\n\nShe added that there were \u201cmany contributions\u201d from Maine voters that were under the $200 reporting threshold. Indeed, there are hundreds of thousands of dollars in unitemized contributions. In theory, they could all be from Mainers and therefore exceed the amount contributed by Kavanaugh supporters.

But at what point does the reluctance of progressives to hit back at Pelosi\u2019s mounting slights start looking less like sophistication and more like an indication that \u201cthe resurgent left\u201d is soft?\n\nWhen The Intercept revealed this week that Pelosi\u2019s top health care staffer met with Blue Cross Blue Shield executives and criticized Medicare for All, progressives generally took a pass on attacking Pelosi.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) refused to take the bait. \u201cUntil I hear my speaker say that there\u2019s an issue, I\u2019m not \u2015 for me, it has to come from her directly,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said she hadn\u2019t read the story but wouldn\u2019t criticize Democratic leadership when asked if they had done enough at this point to advance Medicare for All.\n\nAnd even though the sponsor of the Medicare for All bill, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), said she was \u201cnot happy, obviously,\u201d she praised Pelosi\u2019s support for hearings on the legislation.\n\nWhen Pelosi dismissively called the Green New Deal \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it\u201d \u2014 \u201cnobody knows what it is,\u201d Pelosi added \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez once again avoided criticizing Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think it is a dream,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Progressives are showing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deference, even as she has lobbed slights at their causes.\n\nOther progressives have shown Pelosi similar deference, despite the obvious mocking tone she used to describe the resolution.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I haven\u2019t seen what she said. And honestly, I don\u2019t really care,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said Thursday, \u201cbecause I know Nancy Pelosi, I know her commitment to doing something big on climate, and I know her record.\u201d\n\nPelosi seems to have avoided the sort of criticism conservatives would dish out to a Republican speaker if they felt dissed because progressives generally believe Pelosi is on their side. The speaker did clean up her comments a bit about the Green New Deal during her weekly press conference Thursday, though she also managed a certain backhanded condescension in doing so, saying she welcomed the \u201centhusiasm\u201d of the Green New Deal as well as \u201cthe other proposals that are out there.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, progressives have gone out of their way to stay aligned with Pelosi. After the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis didn\u2019t get the subpoena power progressives wanted, most liberals stayed quiet about it. When Ocasio-Cortez was asked why she didn\u2019t join the committee on Thursday after Pelosi invited her to be on it, the New York lawmaker said it was because she was busy with her other committees \u2015 and she didn\u2019t mention the lack of subpoena power.\n\nProgressives have also stayed in line on a number of other potential flashpoints. When Democratic leadership decided not to censure Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) \u2015 instead offering a resolution so watered down that King himself voted for it \u2015 hardly anyone spoke up. (One of the only members who did speak out was the only member who voted against the resolution, longtime Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, who authored an actual censure resolution against King.)\n\nAt the beginning of the Congress, all but three Democrats \u2015 Ocasio-Cortez, Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) \u2015 voted for a rules package that included pay-as-you-go provisions that progressives thought were harmful to the Medicare for All cause. And Democrats have stayed in line thus far on efforts to impeach President Donald Trump or even to just acquire his tax returns.\n\nBut Pelosi owes much of her power to progressives. They never made an issue out of the California Democrat\u2019s history of taking corporate PAC donations, and Pelosi quickly locked up their support during the speaker\u2019s race, even though high-profile Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez had initially wavered on Pelosi. With the more liberal wing behind her, Pelosi was able to define her opposition as a group of white, moderate men, which in turn put pressure on those Democrats to get behind her.\n\nObviously, the ability to frame issues so shrewdly is part of Pelosi\u2019s power. But she often has such a strong hand because Democrats stick together. During the shutdown, there were hardly any Democrats demanding that Pelosi move away from her original demand that there be no money for a border wall. Again, progressives were key in making that the default Democratic position, though Pelosi also won because she was able to keep every other Democrat in line as well.\n\nBut at what point do progressives start taking Pelosi\u2019s shots personally? When do her efforts to protect vulnerable Democrats from a truly liberal agenda become a problem? And when are progressives going to demand more from their leadership than some placating hearings or a toothless select committee?\n\nWhat we all want is to get something done. And I think we want to move the ball forward. We don\u2019t just want to do press conferences. I mean, we want to achieve things. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.)\n\nFor now, progressives look interested in playing the long game, knowing that none of the bills they really want to pass will become law with Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate. Progressives seem to have taken the view that even voting on their dream legislation would do more to divide Democrats than to advance their cause.\n\nJayapal, the lead author of the Medicare for All bill, told HuffPost on Wednesday that she does have commitments to get hearings on her measure, starting with the Rules Committee under the control of longtime liberal champion Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and then moving to the Budget Committee. She hopes to eventually get hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as in Ways and Means, but she hasn\u2019t asked for a vote.\n\nYou could say the same about the Green New Deal. While Democratic lawmakers made a big show of their Green New Deal rollout on Thursday, the legislation at this point is just a nonbinding resolution with principles for future legislation. It\u2019s a plan to come up with a plan \u2015 and it may never get a vote either.\n\nBut progressives aren\u2019t complaining. They\u2019re not slamming Pelosi, and they\u2019re trying to focus on where there is consensus, like on shoring up Obamacare, lowering drug prices and building initial support for their environmental legislation.\n\nAnd while Pelosi may take an occasional shot or let them down legislatively, they\u2019re not airing their grievances publicly \u2015 at least not yet. (Asked for a comment about this story, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, offered: \u201cWe agree with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez that the caucus will not be \u2018divided by whatever narrative.\u2019\u201d)\n\nLeadership is also looking to stay on the good side of the progressives, despite the occasional slip of the tongue from Pelosi.\n\n\u201cWhat we all want is to get something done,\u201d McGovern told HuffPost on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think we want to move the ball forward.

A separate House subcommittee is charged with building a record of voter suppression across the country that can be used to justify reimplementing one of the most powerful provisions of the Voting Rights Act.

Later Thursday, the Department of Justice released a statement confirming Whitaker\u2019s scheduled appearance.\n\n\u201cActing Attorney General Whitaker looks forward to voluntarily appearing at tomorrow\u2019s hearing and discussing the great work of the Department of Justice,\u201d the statement from DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nEarlier:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is trying to back out of his scheduled Friday testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after the committee voted to subpoena him if he refuses to answer questions about conversations he had with President Donald Trump and invokes executive privilege.\n\nIn a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that Whitaker would not testify unless the committee assures the Justice Department by 6 p.m. that it will not issue a subpoena for Whitaker today or tomorrow and that the committee would engage in \u201cgood faith negotiations\u201d with DOJ before issuing a subpoena.\n\nBy Thursday night, Nadler had attempted to keep Friday\u2019s hearing on schedule, writing in a letter to Whitaker that \u201cthere will be no need for the Committee to issue a subpoena\u201d if Whitaker is prepared to answer questions tomorrow. \u201cTo the extent that you believe you are unable to fully respond to any specific question, we are prepared to handle your concerns on a case-by-case basis, both during and after tomorrow\u2019s hearing,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe high-stakes exchange came after several weeks of negotiations between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee; Whitaker is set to testify voluntarily on Friday about a number of topics. House Democrats plan to press him on his conversations with Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIf Whitaker does testify, the letter said, he would say \u201cat no time did the White House ask for, or did the Acting Attorney General provide, any promises or commitments concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nA senior Justice Department official, speaking on background, told reporters Thursday afternoon that Whitaker had been \u201cworking hard\u201d this week to prepare for his testimony, but that he wasn\u2019t going to testify under threat of subpoena on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the appropriate process... to subpoena first, talk later,\u201d the senior official said. Whitaker, the official said, is \u201cready and willing to appear\u201d under the original terms.\n\nWhitaker, who headed up a conservative organization that targeted Democrats and critiqued the Mueller investigation in cable news hits before joining the Justice Department, was named acting attorney general following the forced resignation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in November. Whitaker previously served as a U.S. attorney during the Bush administration but was not serving in a Senate-confirmed Justice Department role when he was named acting attorney general, making his lengthy term as head of DOJ historically unprecedented.\n\nThe Justice Department issued this statement from Whitaker:\n\n\u201cWeeks ago, in good faith, I voluntarily agreed to appear and testify on February 8 before the House Judiciary Committee. We have devoted considerable resources and numerous hours to my preparation, and I have looked forward to discussing the important work of the great men and women of the Department of Justice. Unfortunately, the Committee now has deviated from historic practice and protocol and taken the unnecessary and premature step of authorizing a subpoena to the me, the Acting Attorney General, even though I had agreed to voluntarily appear. Such unprecedented action breaches our prior agreement and circumvents the constitutionally required accommodation process. Based upon today\u2019s action, it is apparent that the Committee\u2019s true intention is not to discuss the great work of the Department of Justice, but to create a public spectacle. Political theater is not the purpose of an oversight hearing, and I will not allow that to be the case.\n\nThe news came out around the same time as William Barr, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general was cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

A 1993 yearbook lists him as a freshman that year, and he was featured as a Kappa Alpha member starting in the 1994 yearbook. The fraternity, which is still active at Millsaps, looks to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as its spiritual leader.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 1994, members of Kappa Alpha and another fraternity \u201cdonned Afro wigs and tied large Confederate flags around their necks,\u201d according to an article in The Clarion-Ledger at the time. Some of them were also reportedly in blackface. The fraternity brothers \u201cgot into a shouting match\u201d over the incident with some black students. The state fraternity leader defended the chapter, saying it was \u201cgetting a bad rap\u201d and blamed a few rogue individuals.\n\nMembers of the Black Students Association asked for the fraternity to be suspended.\n\nOne of the students leveling the charges against Kappa Alpha was Kiese Laymon, the opinions editor of the student paper. Even before the incident, in August, Laymon wrote a piece about Kappa Alpha\u2019s reputation, lumping the fraternity in with the KKK and neo-Nazis in their love of the Confederate flag.\n\n\u201cAt Millsaps, I know we\u2019ve overcome racism,\u201d Laymon wrote sarcastically in a column, \u201cand if the word \u2018nigger\u2019 is ever muttered, it could only be echoed from the walls of the Kappa Alpha house.\u201d\n\nIn response, a month later, the paper published an anonymous letter from a Kappa Alpha member who acknowledged Laymon was right about the attitudes of his fraternity \u2015 but said that, privately, not all of them were racist and sexist and did want things to change.\n\nIn 1995, the Kappa Alpha yearbook page showed a group of students standing with a Confederate flag in military attire.

After Bland\u2019s death, Texas and Waller County each implemented reforms intended in part to reduce jail suicides, which are highly preventable. But Evan Parker, a 34-year-old black man, died in similar circumstances to Bland anyway \u2014 raising questions about how another hanging in such a closely scrutinized facility could have happened.\n\nParker was booked into Waller County jail on Jan. 10 on charges of murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon related to a workplace attack that left Parker\u2019s supervisor dead. On Jan. 25, he attempted suicide in his cell, according to the Waller County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2014he reportedly hanged himself with a mattress cover. He died at a hospital a couple days later.\n\nSuicide is the leading cause of death in jail. A HuffPost investigation found that of the more than 810 people who lost their lives in jail in the year following Bland\u2019s death, nearly one-third died from suicide. People can quickly deteriorate after being arrested: In HuffPost\u2019s data, at least one-quarter of the suicides occurred within the first three days. But in jails\u2014which mostly hold people who have not been convicted of a crime\u2014suicides can be prevented through processes such as conducting thorough inmate screening and making sure staff monitors inmates at appropriate intervals, which save lives.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know exactly what happened in this case. As of Jan. 25, according to a statement put out by the Waller County District Attorney, there wasn\u2019t any information indicating that jail staff didn\u2019t follow procedures or guidelines; the county sheriff also said there have been \u201cno indications of wrong doing.\u201d An investigation is ongoing, with the F.B.I. and the Texas Ranger Division taking lead.\n\nWaller County jail, which is overseen by Republican Sheriff Glenn Smith, is about 50 miles outside of Houston and is on the smaller side, designed for a capacity of 110 people. In July of 2015, Bland, a 28-year-old black woman, landed in the jail under very different circumstances from Parker: A Texas state trooper pulled her over as she was driving, he claimed, for not signaling when she changed lanes. She initially refused to get out of the car, and after the trooper threatened her with a Taser, in dashcam video, she was heard saying her head was knocked into the ground. She was found hanging in her cell within 65 hours after her arrest. Bland\u2019s case drew national attention to the way police treat black Americans and also brought scrutiny to how jails are responsible for protecting inmates in their care.\n\nAfter her death, a state agency rolled out a new intake form for inmates, a Texas law was passed, the Sandra Bland Act, that includes some jail reforms that are still in the process of being implemented. Bland\u2019s family reached a settlement that stipulated changes to jail procedure in Waller County. A spokesperson for the Waller County Sheriff\u2019s Office told HuffPost \u201cmedical staff on all shifts\u201d and an \u201cimproved screening form and additional training,\u201d were some of the changes made after Bland\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cYou would hope given the scrutiny [Waller County] was under three years ago, it would shape how they go about their business now,\u201d said Cannon Lambert, an attorney who represented Bland\u2019s family in their settlement case. \u201cApparently there\u2019s a gulf between what they\u2019re doing, and what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nAcross Texas, there has been a downward trend in county jail suicides since Bland\u2019s death: In Texas FY15, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, a regulatory agency created by the state\u2019s legislature, recorded 34 jail suicides. In FY2018, there were 22, according to Brandon Wood, executive director of the agency.\n\n\u201cI think quite a bit of it can be attributed to the increased awareness and pressures placed on the system to do a better job,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Waller County has a long history of racism, and with the circumstances of Bland\u2019s case, and the violence inflicted upon black Americans nationwide, some people, including those close to her, questioned whether she really took her own life.\n\nHow Did It Happen?\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Parker\u2019s case so far: The local mental health authority said he did not qualify for suicide watch, but jail staff placed him on it at some point anyway, for what was apparently several days. The Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson declined to comment to HuffPost on the day he was taken off suicide watch, but he was not on it on the day of his suicide attempt. He was checked on \u201cperiodically\u201d and in-person, according to the spokesperson, with a check around 2:21 a.m. before he was found inside his cell near 2:57 a.m.\n\nThe spokesperson did not comment on whether Parker was in a single cell. Reports indicate he was in his cell alone.\n\n\u201cWaller County Sheriff\u2019s Office personnel do their job daily to assure safety of all people and are saddened by any death,\u201d the Sheriff\u2019s spokesperson told HuffPost in an email.\n\nThe situation raises several issues, said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who is an expert in criminal detention, such as whether jail authorities appropriately decided Parker should not be on suicide watch.\n\nWaller County jail has faced other scrutiny since Bland: As recently as Dec. 19, 2018, a Texas jail inspection report found that Waller County jail wasn\u2019t fully compliant with certain standards, which included reports that staff allegedly lagged behind in monitoring inmates. The jail had submitted a corrective plan of action to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, Wood said, adding his staff reviewed it to ensure it addressed the issues.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the community is waiting for answers. Ashton Woods, an activist who founded Black Lives Matter Houston, said he had the same reaction to Parker\u2019s death that he did with Bland\u2019s: \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t feel right about this, it\u2019s all too familiar,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a few years now to correct these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had a bad experience in the past, same sheriff, and it looks like they don\u2019t get it,\u201d said state Sen.

In a 2016 amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court, he wrote that a Washington state law requiring pharmacists either to fill a medical prescription or find an available pharmacist who will, which had been upheld by the 9th Circuit, \u201cauthorizes an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion on the most basic right of conscience.\u201d The Supreme Court let the 9th Circuit decision stand.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Wendy Vitter\n\nWendy Vitter, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana\n\nThe 58-year-old attorney is a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn\u2019t tell senators about her extreme comments on the topic.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood says they promote women\u2019s health,\u201d Vitter said in a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new clinic in New Orleans. \u201cIt is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women\u2019s health is to let them live.\u201d\n\nAhead of her 2018 confirmation hearing, Vitter, whose husband is former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), did not disclose to the committee that she had moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference peddling false information about the dangers of abortion \u2015 or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms claiming that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News later uncovered these missing materials.\n\nC-SPAN Howard C. Nielson Jr.\n\nHoward C. Nielson Jr., nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah\n\nThe 51-year-old lawyer fought for California\u2019s short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, before it was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n\nDuring the case, Nielson argued that sexual orientation is a choice and disputed the harmful effects of discrimination on LGBTQ people. When a U.S. district court ruled in 2010 that Prop 8 violated the Constitution, Nielson argued that then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker should have recused himself from the case because he was gay and therefore, Nielson claimed, unable to be fair on the issue. He filed a motion contending that Walker \u201chad a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his [same-sex] relationship, but also his marriage intentions.\u201d That motion was denied by another judge.\n\nNielson also defended a former Justice Department colleague who wrote a controversial and now-rescinded memo authorizing the CIA\u2019s use of torture.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Patrick Wyrick\n\nPatrick Wyrick, nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nThe 37-year-old Oklahoma Supreme Court justice made limiting reproductive rights a top priority when he previously served as state solicitor general. In one case, he defended a law that would have required minors to obtain a prescription before buying emergency contraception. The law would have also forced adult women to prove their age before purchasing such contraception. The legislation was permanently blocked by a state judge in 2014.\n\nWyrick filed an amicus brief in the landmark 2014 Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations are in some circumstances exempt from regulations their owners object to on religious grounds \u2014 specifically, the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his brief, Wyrick argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because \u201creligious faith is more than mere belief. It is practice.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal_us_5c588e7fe4b09293b20730d7": "The Green New Deal is finally taking form.\n\nOn Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) unveiled a landmark resolution cementing the pillars of an unprecedented program to zero out planet-warming emissions and restore the middle-class prosperity of postwar America that the original New Deal helped spur.\n\nJust three months after calls for a Green New Deal electrified a long-stagnant debate on climate policy, the Democratic lawmakers released the six-page document outlining plans to cut global emissions 40 to 60 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and neutralize human-caused greenhouse gases entirely by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday is a big day for workers in Appalachia,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cToday is a good day for children who have been breathing dirty air in the Bronx.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious, if measured, clarion call for action that, if accomplished, would transform the United States into the leader in decarbonizing and clear a path forward for the world to avert catastrophic warming.\n\nThe joint resolution stakes out a \u201cten-year national mobilization\u201d plan to build \u201csmart\u201d grids and rapidly increase the share of American power generated from solar and wind from 10 percent today to as close to 100 percent as possible over the next decade. The plan reframes tired talk of repairing the nation\u2019s crumbling bridges, highways and ports as a crisis in a new era of billion-dollar storms. It gets local, demanding upgrades to \u201call existing U.S. buildings\u201d to \u201cachieve maximum\u201d efficiency with energy and water use.\n\nThat holistic framing extends to the way the document describes emissions, mentioning \u201ccarbon\u201d just once and instead using the term \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d which includes methane, nitrous oxide and ozone.\n\nEnergy and infrastructure issues are the centerpiece of the resolution, with explicit goals of overhauling the transportation sector \u2015 the country\u2019s biggest source of climate pollution \u2015 to expand public transit and high-speed rail and to spur a \u201cclean\u201d manufacturing boom with a particular focus on electric vehicles.\n\nBut, unlike most existing Green New Deal concepts, food and water are focal points. The resolution proposes \u201cbuilding a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food\u201d and \u201cguaranteeing universal access to clean water.\u201d To meet those goals, the document describes \u201cworking collaboratively with farmers and ranchers\u201d to reduce agricultural pollution with \u201csustainable farming and land use practices that increase soil health\u201d and \u201csupporting family farming.\u201d\n\nUnabashedly progressive ideals anchor the resolution. A section outlining guidelines for future Green New Deal bills reads like a laundry list of populist policies, including everything from ramped-up antitrust enforcement \u2015 \u201censuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by\u201d monopolies \u2015 to a vastly expanded social safety net, \u201cproviding all people of the United States high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security, and access to clean water, air and healthy and affordable food, and nature.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution seems designed for broad appeal. The fact that Markey, a liberal stalwart who co-authored the last major climate bill Democrats tried to pass in 2009, is the lead Senate sponsor shows the insurgent Ocasio-Cortez wing is building bridges with the old guard.\n\nReuters Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) was the co-sponsor of the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill Democrats nearly passed a decade ago. Now he's spearheading the resolution effort with Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe resolution itself avoids controversial technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, instead calling for low-tech solutions, such as large-scale preservation and planting new forests to absorb carbon already in the atmosphere. In a news release, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team said carbon capture \u201ctechnology to date has not proven effective.\u201d\n\nThe resolution contains more obvious compromises. In a departure from the initial protests that gave rise to the Green New Deal, the document avoids explicitly calling for ending fossil fuel development. It leaves open the possibility of keeping existing nuclear power plants in place until after the initial 10-year mobilization plan is complete, admitting that \u201cwe are currently unsure if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant that fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution is silent on any individual technology which can move us toward a solution on this problem,\u201d Markey said at the press conference. \u201cThis is a resolution that does not have individual prescriptions in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are open to whatever works,\u201d he added later.\n\nBucking the prevailing bipartisan orthodoxy on climate policy, the resolution makes no mention of pricing carbon. The release stated that the \u201cdoor is not closed for market-based incentives or a diverse array of policy levers to play a role in the Green New Deal, but it would be a small role.\u201d\n\nTo supporters, those candid admissions showed that the document represented a feasible first step toward legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is how green socialists will govern,\u201d said Greg Carlock, the researcher at the think tank Data for Progress, whose Green New Deal blueprint from September resembles the resolution. \u201cIt will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe resolution dropped with poignant timing. During his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump ignored climate change and touted a fossil fuel agenda projected to put the world on course for cataclysmic warming, analysis by researchers at more than a dozen environmental groups projects found. On Wednesday, House Democrats kicked off two hearings on climate change less than two hours before NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2018 the fourth-hottest year ever recorded.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the resolution\u2019s prospects of passing. The GOP controls the Senate, and Republican opposition to the Green New Deal started to crystallize at Wednesday\u2019s hearings.\n\nEven among Democrats, who control the House, support is far from guaranteed. By Thursday morning, the resolution garnered more than 60 House Democrats and at least nine Senate Democrats signed onto the resolution. But in a Politico interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is.\u201d Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace issued statements that tempered their support by calling for explicit fossil fuel phase-outs.\n\nThe sort of Green New Deal the resolution describes poses an existential threat to entrenched, deep-pocketed industries that donate to Democrats. Building a constituency powerful enough to challenge fossil fuel producers, automakers and utilities requires support from the labor movement.\n\nYet the influential building-trade unions are skeptical of any policy that impedes fossil fuel infrastructure, a reliable source of lucrative contract jobs. The resolution aims to ease those worries, \u201censuring that Green New Deal mobilization creates high-quality union jobs that pay prevailing wages, hire local workers, offer training and advancement opportunities and guarantee wage and benefit parity for workers affected by the transition.\u201d\n\nBut that rhetoric isn\u2019t new, and it does little to assuage festering concerns. Renewable energy jobs tend to pay less and use fewer unionized workers than pipeline or coal-train gigs. The problem, too, is the steady erosion of labor laws over the past few decades, diminishing hopes that clean-energy work could easily reach wage parity with fossil fuels under existing statutes. A Green New Deal, in that sense, necessitates changes to labor law almost as dramatic as those governing energy and infrastructure. To that end, the resolution directly calls for \u201cstrengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe potential opposition from building trades hasn\u2019t made the Green New Deal any less popular with Democrats\u2019 swelling pool of 2020 contenders. Nearly every declared and likely candidate \u2015 former Vice President Joe Biden is a notable exception \u2015 has offered an endorsement of the Green New Deal in some form or another.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who threw his support behind the Green New Deal resolution last week, is one potential candidate. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) backed the Green New Deal in December, tying support for its climate goals to a jobs guarantee bill he already introduced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) last month sent a letter to the Republican in charge of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee outlining her support for a Green New Deal. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a likely frontrunner when he declares his candidacy, is considering legislation of his own on a Green New Deal.\n\nOthers are vague. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro all said they support the \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cconcept\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nThe resolution may draw clearer battle lines.\n\n\u201cI expect that we\u2019re going to see a lot of people saying they approve of the spirit, they love the bill, they just question whether it could pass as legislation,\u201d said R.L. Miller, president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a starting point.\u201d\n\nThis is how green socialists will govern. It will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious. Greg Carlock, Data for Progress\n\nThe Green New Deal, originally coined in the mid-2000s as a term connoting a way to bridge the environmental and economic goals, re-emerged last year as Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing Democrats ran on unabashedly progressive visions of curbing climate-changing emissions and eradicating poverty in the same stroke. In November, activists from the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats staged sit-in protests in Democratic leaders\u2019 offices, demanding they make a Green New Deal a policy priority in the newly flipped House.\n\nOcasio-Cortez joined the protests, and soon after unveiled a resolution calling for a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House. Pelosi rejected the plan even as roughly 40 Democrats agreed to support the resolution. Instead, she revived a decade-old select committee on climate change, and put a backbench moderate Democrat in charge of the panel.\n\nBut the demonstrations thrust the Green New Deal into the national spotlight. It proved popular. In December, 81 percent of registered voters said they supported a plan to generate 100 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity from clean sources within the next 10 years, upgrade the U.S. power grid, invest in energy efficiency and renewable technology, and provide training for jobs in the new, green economy, according to a poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University. That included 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans, with an eyebrow-raising 57 percent of conservative Republicans in agreement.\n\nAnother poll published last week found voters narrowly supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThe left is putting its heads together on how we can actually govern, how we can go from an opposition force, a resistance force, to one that can do things of the many, rather than the 1 percent,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst at 350.org. Speaking of the resolution, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in this.\u201d\n\nStephen O\u2019Hanlon, a Sunrise Movement spokesman, downplayed the disparities between the resolution and some of the initial demands his fellow activists made \u2015 namely the lack of an explicit fossil fuel phase-out or a hard 2030 deadline for 100 percent renewables.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bill, which means there\u2019s a lot of details to be worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still feel very good about the pieces that are still being figured out.\u201d\n\nThe resolution includes justice provisions that would be difficult to criticize. It echoes the 2015 Dakota Access pipeline protests that Ocasio-Cortez credits with inspiring her to run for office. In one section, it calls for \u201cobtaining free, prior and informed consent for Indigenous peoples for all decisions that impact them and their traditional territories.\u201d The document opens with a pledge to \u201cpromote justice and equity by stopping current, prevent future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez said at the press conference that her focus was on \u201cfully funding coal miners\u2019 pensions\u201d and \u201ccleaning the water in West Virginia.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution looks beyond the Green New Deal\u2019s impact at home. One provision, as HuffPost reported Tuesday, calls for the United States to \u201cpromoting the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding, and services with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nThat could spark a new debate over how central climate change should be to the progressive foreign policy vision taking shaping ahead of the 2020 election. Though China surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide over a decade ago, Americans boast far larger CO2 footprints per capita and remain the world\u2019s largest historic emitters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have a discussion about the debt we owe to the international community for our reckless treatment of the environment,\u201d said Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress. \u201cIt will be a tough discussion but it shows the way Ocasio-Cortez is changing the discussion.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-dingell-dead-congress_us_57042d5de4b0a506064d7398": "Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images John Dingell served in Congress for just shy of 60 years.\n\nJohn Dingell Jr., the Michigan Democrat who became the longest-serving member of Congress, died Thursday at age 92.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of John David Dingell Jr., former Michigan Congressman and longest-serving member of the United States Congress,\u201d said a statement late Thursday from the office of his wife, Rep.

Debbie Dingell said she missed the State of the Union address on Tuesday to be with him.\n\n\u201cHe is my love and we have been a team for nearly 40 years,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday.\n\nFriends and colleagues know me and know I would be in Washington right now unless something was up.

Gretchen Whitmer said Dingell will \u201cforever be remembered as \u2018The Dean\u2019 of Congress,\u201d noting his roles in passing the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe are a stronger, safer, healthier nation because of Congressman Dingell\u2019s 59 years of service, and his work will continue to improve the lives of Michiganders for generations to come,\u201d she said in a statement Thursday night.\n\nAn old-school Democrat, Dingell represented southeastern Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives for 59 years before retiring in 2015.\n\nUpon hearing of his retirement plans, President Barack Obama called Dingell \u201cone of the most influential legislators of all time,\u201d a sentiment he echoed when awarding the longtime congressman the Presidential Medal of Freedom in late 2014.\n\nDingell was diagnosed around a year ago with prostate cancer, his family said, and he decided not to treat it as it metastasized, opting instead for hospice care.\n\nOver his nearly six decades in Congress, the spirited Dingell played a key role in advancing a slew of landmark laws, including the 1965 legislation that created Medicare, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Appreciated for his sense of humor and wit, he was also one of the last veterans of World War II to serve in Congress.\n\nIf he had his way, though, the legislative branch in which he served for so long would operate much differently: Dingell was a strong proponent of abolishing the Senate. He argued that it does not represent the interests of the American people, calling for a grassroots movement to combine the two chambers into one.\n\nCQ Roll Call via Getty Images House Speaker Sam Rayburn swears in 29-year-old John Dingell Jr. on Dec. 13, 1955.\n\nDingell was born in Colorado Springs on July 8, 1926. His political life began early: His father, John Dingell, was elected in 1932 to represent what was then Michigan\u2019s 15th Congressional District.\n\nAfter growing up in the Great Depression on peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwiches, the younger Dingell spent his teen years as a page in the U.S. House, from 1938 to 1943. He joined the U.S. Army in 1944, serving until 1946. With the end of the war, Dingell went on to earn his undergraduate and law degrees at Georgetown University. He married his first wife, Helen Henebry, with whom he had four children.\n\nHe was working as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County, Michigan, when his father died in 1955, prompting Dingell Jr. to enter and win the special election to fill his late father\u2019s congressional seat. While the borders and numbering of the districts would shift over the decades, he would be re-elected to the House 29 times, usually by comfortable margins.\n\nDingell\u2019s power base within Congress was the House Commerce Committee (now officially the House Energy and Commerce Committee), which oversees a broad range of issues and federal activities. He served on the panel for more than 57 years, including about 16 years as chairman. He was known for his demanding demeanor with witnesses, including government officials, and his penchant for sending harshly worded letters, or \u201cDingellgrams,\u201d by the hundreds to agency leaders.\n\n\u201cI try to be humane on the issues, but there are times I have to be ruthless. I am not here to be a well-liked patsy,\u201d Dingell told People magazine in 1986.\n\nDouglas Graham/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Dingell and then-Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), seen here during a 1997 hearing on managed care reform. The two worked for years to advance universal health care.\n\nDingell introduced a bill to provide universal health care each term he was in Congress. It was a measure first introduced by his father, a strong proponent of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. During his time in Congress, the younger Dingell\u2019s persistence slowly brought reforms to the country\u2019s health care programs.\n\n\u201cAs I have revised the bill over the years, we found about half of the original legislation has been enacted into law,\u201d he told NPR in 2009.\n\nIn 1965, Dingell presided over the House as it passed a bill to establish Medicare, a program his father had also initially proposed. He also helped enact children\u2019s health insurance and vaccine initiatives.\n\nObama recognized the lawmaker\u2019s contributions toward the Affordable Care Act in a statement on Dingell\u2019s retirement.\n\n\u201cOf all John\u2019s accomplishments, perhaps the most remarkable has been his tireless fight to guarantee quality, affordable health care for every American. ... And as an original author of the Affordable Care Act, he helped give millions of families the peace of mind of knowing they won\u2019t lose everything if they get sick,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Rep.

Pelosi is holding the gavel that Dingell used when he presided over the vote to pass Medicare in 1965 and that she used during the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDingell\u2019s reach went well beyond health care, however. He was a strong proponent of the environment and heavily involved in crafting key legislation to combat pollution, save endangered species and require the government to consider the environmental consequences of development.\n\nAsked in a Reddit Q&A last year why Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about global warming, Dingell replied with a heaping serving of snark: \u201cBecause they\u2019re preparing for the hot place in hell that awaits many of them?\u201d\n\nThe former congressman also helped create North America\u2019s first international wildlife refuge along the Detroit River. A new visitors center at the refuge was named in his honor in January 2017.\n\nOf the 28,551 votes he cast in Congress, Dingell called his support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 his \u201csingle most important vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did give the country a tremendous amount of hope that we could move to other things that were important,\u201d he said, reflecting on the landmark law in 2012.\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Dingell talks about the caribou and elk antlers that adorn the walls of his congressional office in 2014.\n\nDingell was an avid hunter who decorated his Capitol Hill office with the trophies of his kills. His strong advocacy of gun rights, however, earned him criticism from progressives along with high ratings from the National Rifle Association. He served on the NRA\u2019s board of directors for years, but resigned in 1994 as he prepared to vote for an NRA-opposed crime bill that banned a number of assault weapons. (Dingell said he opposed the weapon ban but supported the bill.)\n\nProgressive allies also criticized the Michigan congressman for his longtime support of the auto industry, which led him to oppose stricter vehicle fuel-efficiency standards. His second wife, Debbie, was a lobbyist for General Motors when they met. While she gave up that role when they married in 1981, she worked for GM for 30 years.\n\n\u201cI am elected to represent the people of Michigan and in our part of the country,\u201d he once said. \u201cMy people live and die by the success of the auto industry and manufacturing.\u201d\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Dingell became the longest-serving member of Congress in history. By the time he retired, he had served 59 years and 22 days, according to the Office of the Historian of the U.S. House.\n\nHe was apparently ready to be rid of Washington politics.\n\n\u201cI find serving in the House to be obnoxious,\u201d Dingell told Detroit News editorial page editor Nolan Finley upon announcing his pending retirement in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s become very hard because of the acrimony and bitterness, both in Congress and in the streets. ... This is not the Congress I know and love.\u201d\n\nDebbie Dingell, who remained active in politics and the D.C. social scene during her husband\u2019s congressional tenure, won the election to succeed him in November 2014.\n\nBrendan Hoffman/Getty Images John and Debbie Dingell arrive for a state dinner at the White House in honor of British Prime Minister David Cameron on March 14, 2012.\n\nIn the midst of serious business, John Dingell had a lighthearted side, with room for a wink and a laugh when warranted. Every holiday season, his office put out a \u201cDingell Jingle\u201d commenting on current congressional events in the meter of a poem or song \u2015 a tradition his wife has carried on.\n\nDingell\u2019s staffers helped keep his Twitter and Facebook accounts packed with photos and jokes about the events of the day and Michigan sports. (The Atlantic once named his Twitter feed the best in Congress.) After retiring, Dingell remained active on social media, attracting attention for his fiery live-tweeting of a GOP presidential debate in late 2015.\n\nOne of his better-known Twitter exchanges occurred in 2014, in response to a since-deleted tweet from the EPA Water account that mentioned celebrity Kim Kardashian and an iPhone game:\n\nI'm the last original author of the Clean Water Act, but I have no idea who/what a Kardashian is and I rarely play games.

From the looks of it, 2019 has plenty to offer, including Awkwafina as a leading lady, Adam Driver as a political whistleblower and Demi Moore as a corporate megalomaniac.\n\nSundance is unwinding with a few high-profile deals to its name, including Amazon\u2019s surprising payouts (between $13 million and $14 million) for the Mindy Kaling show-biz satire \u201cLate Night,\u201d the political thriller \u201cThe Report\u201d and the Jillian Bell body-image comedy \u201cBrittany Runs a Marathon.\u201d Meanwhile, the gentrification dramedy \u201cThe Last Black Man in San Francisco\u201d and the moody British thriller \u201cThe Souvenir\u201d kindled buzz on the ground, as did the documentaries \u201cCold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld,\u201d \u201cAsk Dr. Ruth,\u201d \u201cOne Child Nation\u201d and the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez profile \u201cKnock Down the House.\u201d If a peppy Bruce Springsteen singalong is more your thing, there\u2019s \u201cBlinded by the Light,\u201d the latest from \u201cBend It Like Beckham\u201d director Gurinder Chadha.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to see everything on Sundance\u2019s slate in less than a week, but here\u2019s the best of what I caught during the festival.\n\n\u201cThe Farewell\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Sundance Institute\n\n\u201cThe Farewell,\u201d the sophomore feature from Lulu Wang (\u201cPosthumous\u201d), opens with droll text that would seem at home in a Coen brothers movie: \u201cBased on an actual lie.\u201d\n\nThe lie in question concerns a Chinese family that opts to conceal from their eldest matriarch (Shuzhen Zhou, excellent) a cancer diagnosis that could end her life. This is a common practice in China, the film tells us; without all the prolonged adieus, death doesn\u2019t sting as hard. But lying by omission isn\u2019t easy for Billi (Awkwafina), a Brooklyn transplant who broadcasts her emotions and has a tight relationship with her grandmother, whom everyone calls Nai Nai. Despite admonishments from her mother (Diana Lin), who doesn\u2019t believe she can keep the secret, Billi rushes home for one final family reunion, knowing she will say goodbye without actually saying goodbye.\n\nBilli is Wang\u2019s analog; before turning it into an autobiographical script, the filmmaker told the story on \u201cThis American Life\u201d in 2016. That personal touch is evident in the way Wang balances situational comedy and deep-seated drama, crafting a loveliness that feels intimate and specific yet endlessly relatable to anyone who has witnessed a loved one\u2019s final days. But the movie is no funeral: Events revolve around a family wedding that touches on middle-class anxieties, generational differences and China\u2019s mouth-watering food culture \u2015 grist for hilarity and waterworks alike. Wang proves to be a superb storyteller, able to give her characters dimensions simply by observing their mannerisms and accentuating their quirks.\n\nAfter scene-stealing breakouts in last year\u2019s \u201cOcean\u2019s 8\u201d and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d Awkwafina, n\u00e9e Nora Lum, is making a wise, delicate pivot that reconfirms her comedic talent but offers new layers as an actress. It\u2019s a quieter role, less dependent on one-liners and flashy gestures \u2015 a perfect way forward for both her and Wang, who is easily Sundance\u2019s key director to watch. Indie studio A24 snatched up the movie for a reported $6 million, giving its \u201cactual lie\u201d what will hopefully be a long shelf life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Report\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nIs it true that the best political thrillers feature a whispery scene in the shadows of a parking garage where secrets are exchanged? After \u201cThe Report,\u201d I\u2019m starting to think so. When Senate investigator Daniel Jones (Adam Driver in a commanding lead role) meets a New York Times reporter (Matthew Rhys) to tip him off that the American government is misleading the public about its use of post-9/11 torture practices in the Middle East, director Scott Z. Burns invokes the genre\u2019s crown jewel, \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201d It\u2019s the sexiest a movie can get without taking its clothes off.\n\n\u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d is the great political thriller, as well as the great process movie \u2014 two genres that have also blended to exquisite results in \u201cThe Parallax View,\u201d \u201cThirteen Days\u201d and \u201cThe Post.\u201d Add \u201cThe Report\u201d to the list. Burns\u2019 sober, briskly paced drama follows Jones as he goes to lengths to research and disclose the inhumane acts the CIA ordered in hopes of extracting information from suspected al Qaeda terrorists. The film\u2019s intelligence makes \u201cVice\u201d look like a dilapidated dunce cap, largely because it indicts leaders like Dick Cheney without needing to turn them into cartoons (or to include them as characters at all). Here, the heroes have more to say about the state of America\u2019s geopolitical horrors than any \u201cMacbeth\u201d-style villains. Enter Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Intelligence Committee chair played by a steely Annette Bening (Oscar time!), to whom Jones answers.\n\nBurns, a Steven Soderbergh acolyte who wrote \u201cSide Effects\u201d and \u201cContagion,\u201d has made a dense, star-studded film that flows with spry energy, even when it veers into book-report territory. \u201cThe Report\u201d connects dots all the way to the Obama administration and undercooked terrorism content like \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d and \u201c24\u201d; no one emerges unscathed. Like everything America has undergone in the 21st century, it is far too sophisticated for pat simplicities. The truth is complex and disarming \u2014 but it can also be entertaining as hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCorporate Animals\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nPatrick Brice is among my favorite underrated (and understated) filmmakers. In \u201cThe Overnight,\u201d he gave us a comedy of manners that unfolds across one capricious evening. With the \u201cCreep\u201d movies, he tells a home-invasion horror story that rises above its found-footage trappings. And in \u201cCorporate Animals,\u201d Brice takes a workplace farce out of the office and into a cave, employing a goofy absurdism to arraign New Age brands, corporate malfeasance and celebrity CEOs.\n\nThe vainglorious chief executive, Lucy, is played deliciously by Demi Moore, who has long deserved a comeback. The script, written by \u201cPeep Show\u201d alum Sam Bain, turns Lucy into a Gwyneth Paltrow type leading a Goop-esque lifestyle outfit whose signature product is edible cutlery \u2014 a laughable idea stolen from an underling (Karan Soni) she slept with. The movie opens with Lucy\u2019s staff embarking on one of those outdoor team-building retreats in dusty New Mexico. When it\u2019s time to go cave-diving, she insists their guide (Ed Helms) take them on the hardest course available, despite their all being novices. Things immediately turn disastrous; they wind up stuck underground for days, left to feast on each other metaphorically and... well... it\u2019s best to discover the details for yourself. They grow increasingly clever and increasingly surreal, thanks to the rat-a-tat dialogue and top-notch comic work from Moore, Soni, Jessica Williams, Martha Kelly, Nasim Pedrad and \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d star Calum Worthy. It\u2019s a stoner comedy without any weed and a satire without too many ham-fisted Big Ideas.\n\nWhen I chatted with Moore at the premiere\u2019s after-party, she likened her character to a certain blowhard whose corporate notoriety landed him in the White House. We can talk more about that when the movie opens, but let\u2019s just say it might be nice if things ended for him the way they do for Lucy. \u201cCorporate Animals\u201d is a hoot, rechristening Brice as a master of unpretentious gems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJawline\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nEnough can\u2019t be said about social media influencer culture: the economics surrounding the nascent enterprise, the artificiality of the \u201cjust stay positive\u201d messages that provide grist for platforms like Instagram and YouNow, the catalyst that vaults teenagers to miniature superstardom so they can later suffer rejection they\u2019re ill-equipped to handle. The digital world is cold, no matter how many sunny photos or smiley videos a person posts \u2014 and \u201cJawline\u201d understands that better than anything else that has tackled the phenomenon.\n\nThe protagonist of Liza Mandelup\u2019s handsome documentary is Austyn Tester, a Tennessee-based teen with a limiting home life who enjoyed a stint of internet fame. Like the many other baby-faced boys who attract fan bases simply by being themselves \u2014 or simulacra of themselves \u2014 before a camera, Austyn has a stable of girls who treat him like a movie star, begging for a shout-out when he broadcasts a live video or posts a photo on Instagram. He\u2019s nice and charming if not particularly original, much like his counterparts, many of whom land management deals before they even know how to interpret the contracts they\u2019re signing. Some get screwed financially, others emotionally. Others still become full-on brands, providing a fleeting bright spot for teens who are bullied or depressed. But when the bottom drops out, where is there to go?\n\nMandelup explores these questions from multiple vantages without resorting to grandiose generalizations about Today\u2019s Youth. She indicts the social media infrastructure but humanizes the very real people within it, almost as if last year\u2019s \u201cEighth Grade\u201d were nonfiction. The conclusions are left for you to interpret; there are no experts or sociologists to wax on about How We Got Here and Where We Are Going. \u201cJawline\u201d manages to make us worry for modern teen life as it drifts further from traditional popular culture, turning promising kids into one-trick ponies \u2014 but the film never preaches or overreaches. Instead, it does what a documentary is meant to do: document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHoney Boy\u201d\n\nStay Gold Features\n\nShia LaBeouf has spent the better part of his life inspiring unfavorable headlines, having progressed from \u201cEven Stevens\u201d wunderkind to attention-seeking troublemaker. He reckons with that trajectory, and with his spiral into substance abuse and depression, in \u201cHoney Boy,\u201d LaBeouf\u2019s autobiographical debut screenplay. The results are part therapy session, part memoir, part plea for forgiveness. Is he forgiving himself, or asking us to do so? Is he absolving his irascible, unreliable father, portrayed as a drug-addled stage parent, or indicting him as the root of LaBeouf\u2019s troubles? Probably all of the above.\n\nIn a curious exercise that shines through and through, LaBeouf plays an analog of his own father, with gifted 13-year-old Noah Jupe (\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d) portraying a LaBeouf avatar named Otis who stars on a \u201cStevens\u201d-type sitcom. Together, the two actors are dynamite, as is Lucas Hedges, who plays Otis in his late teens, once he\u2019s become a blockbuster star facing his own alcoholic demons and volcanic tempers. But \u201cHoney Boy\u201d isn\u2019t just some butch vanity project; it\u2019s a moving portrait of fame, family and personal growth, directed with a poetic touch by Alma Har\u2019el, who lends a light, sympathetic hand to what at times plays like a devastating symphony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nWatching your heroes fall is never easy, and for fans of Michael Jackson, \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d will prove to be a particularly difficult experience.\n\nDan Reed\u2019s heartbreaking four-hour documentary centers on two men who allege they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson, repeatedly, before puberty. Reed applies a delicate hand in chronicling Wade Robson and James Safechuck\u2019s experiences with Jackson, who became a mentor and pseudo-family member to each before allegedly introducing them, separately, to masturbation, pornography, sex and more. Reed evokes in his two subjects, as well as various relatives who saw Jackson as a harmless idol with a childlike complex, a raw candor that challenges anyone to doubt their accounts. Instead of evaluating Jackson\u2019s cultural legacy, \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d focuses squarely on Robson and Safechuck \u2014 the way they trusted Jackson and treasured his friendship, only to be later cast aside for younger boys and left to wonder what went wrong. It wasn\u2019t until their 30s when they realized the episodes entailed textbook abuse.\n\n\u201cNeverland\u201d is a gutting watch, split across two halves. Jackson\u2019s loyal defenders will pick holes in the information presented, as Reed opted not to feature the interviews he conducted with detectives, trauma experts and others who might help to corroborate Robson and Safechuck\u2019s accounts. But at four hours, the film is so dense with details that it becomes, in my estimation, unimpeachable. It is pieced together in a way that aligns Robson and Safechuck\u2019s stories in damning ways, especially since the two didn\u2019t know each other when they were inducted into Jackson\u2019s inner sanctum. It\u2019s graphic without being prurient, bold without being unnecessarily provocative. And it\u2019s a must-watch for anyone interested in understanding what sexual abuse does to a person\u2019s life, and why celebrity worship needs limits \u2014 which is to say it\u2019s a must-watch for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few other performances to look out for\n\n\u2022 Ashton Sanders, so effective in the middle section of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d leads a modern adaptation of \u201cNative Son,\u201d swaggering his way to security before learning that living in a black body is an inherent risk.\n\n\u2022 The Mindy Kaling-written \u201cLate Night\u201d doesn\u2019t always work, but Emma Thompson sure does. With expert timing, she plays a veteran late-night host with an icy offstage persona and a biting tongue.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ve never seen Lupita Nyong\u2019o like this \u2015 \u201cthis\u201d being a madcap comedy in which she beheads zombies during an outbreak that interrupts her kindergarten class\u2019 petting-zoo field trip. In front of her students, she is impossibly rosy; upon turning away, she is all stony determination. It\u2019s a fun balance from someone known for austere drama.\n\n\u2022 Perhaps \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is limiting Pete Davidson more than we know. Turns out he has an engaging screen presence and a dimensionality that \u201cSNL\u201d doesn\u2019t always let him showcase, lending his immature \u201cBig Time Adolescence\u201d character an electricity that surpasses the movie\u2019s clich\u00e9s.\n\n\u2022 In the messy horror whatsit \u201cWounds,\u201d Armie Hammer plays the quintessential overconfident white man \u2015 and what do you know, he\u2019s perfect.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicare-for-all-sherrod-brown-bernie-sanders_us_5c589635e4b00187b5540a87": "Sherrod Brown has been calling for universal health care since 1992. That's when he first ran for a U.S. House seat in Ohio, vowing to decline the federally subsidized insurance for members of Congress until his constituents could get similar coverage. He won that race and he kept that pledge, buying policies on his own until 2011, after the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\nHe was a senator by that point, and like every other Democrat in the chamber, he voted for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. But before Brown did that, he promoted a series of proposals designed to make the program more generous and comprehensive. One of them was a last-minute amendment that would have replaced Obamacare\u2019s intricate scheme for competing private insurers with a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program, under which everybody would enroll in a government-run insurance plan.\n\nNobody seriously thought Democrats were about to scrap legislation they had spent nearly a year writing. By supporting the amendment, Brown was mostly trying to demonstrate his commitment to improving the Affordable Care Act, if not before it became law, then afterward. It was a symbolic act, but a conspicuous one, with only one other senator co-sponsoring it.\n\nThe amendment\u2019s author was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the most visible champion of \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In 2016 he made the idea a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, and a year later, he introduced a new version of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d legislation \u2015 this time, with 16 co-sponsors, proving just how popular the idea had become in the interim.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) on \"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" on Jan. 23. Brown, who previously supported \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d now says he wants to focus on narrower ideas, like opening up Medicare to near-retirees, because they are more politically realistic.\n\nBut this time Brown declined to join them, explaining in a prepared statement that while he remained \u201csupportive of \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019\u201d he preferred to focus on more incremental, potentially bipartisan measures, like allowing people to buy into Medicare as early as their 50s.\n\nNow Brown is thinking about a run for president himself. And like every other Democrat who has launched a 2020 campaign or is seriously contemplating one, he has been getting questions about whether he will endorse \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d His answer has been \u201cno,\u201d and he has become more explicit about why, saying he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic politically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 and make a good speech but see no action,\u201d Brown told Politico in late January, \u201cI want to see action.\u201d This weekend, he told voters at an Iowa forum that \u201cIf we can get Medicare to 50, if we can pass Medicare at 55 tomorrow, two things would happen. A whole lot of people\u2019s lives would improve, and a whole lot of voters would think, \u2018Oh, that works. The next step is to do more.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s posture has already provoked criticism from progressives. If he proceeds with a presidential campaign, he can expect a lot more of it \u2015 as can any other Democratic candidates whose commitment to \u201cMedicare for all\u201d seems suspect.\n\nJust ask Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is running for president. After reaffirming on CNN last week that she supports \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d aides made clear (as they did previously) that she remained open to incremental steps or alternative methods of achieving universal coverage. Social media erupted with accusations from activists that she was watering down her position. So far, the only person who seems immune is Sanders, who may join the 2020 race.\n\nNone of this should be surprising. Presidential campaigns are all about making distinctions among candidates, and there are real differences between somebody like Brown, who doesn\u2019t want to push \u201cMedicare for all\u201d right now, and somebody like Sanders, who does. But the question for Democratic voters over the next year and a half, as they choose their 2020 presidential candidate, is exactly what those differences reveal and, ultimately, which ones matter.\n\nThe Debate Over \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 Is Real Now\n\nOne thing that shouldn\u2019t be in doubt is that nearly all the major Democratic 2020 candidates believe in universal health care coverage, which has been a core party value since President Harry Truman tried to create a national health program in the late 1940s.\n\nTruman had in mind a government-run system that would cover everybody. When his effort crumbled in the face of lobbying by the American Medical Association and other health care industry groups, Democrats began a decades-long effort to get to universal coverage by some other method \u2015 whether it was providing government-run insurance to just part of the population, as Medicare does, or preserving a large role for private insurance, as the ACA does.\n\nThe tilt toward private insurance coincided with a time when the Democratic Party as a whole had a more conservative orientation and its policy advisers had more faith in private enterprise and the forces of competition. Now interest in government-run insurance appears to be surging, partly because so many people still face high medical bills even with the ACA in place and partly because managing Obamacare\u2019s complex markets has proved difficult, with Republicans constantly trying to undermine them.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has said she favors \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But she has also said she's open to other forms of universal coverage and would support incremental reforms on the way to universal health care coverage.\n\nThe 2017 Sanders proposal, which has become the de facto standard for progressives, would address these problems by creating a government-run plan that automatically enrolls everybody, covers every medically necessary service and asks beneficiaries to pay nothing out of their pockets when they visit the doctor or get a lab test. With taxes likely replacing premiums (the Sanders bill doesn\u2019t fully specify financing) and the government setting prices for every kind of medical supply and treatment, the goal would be to reduce overall health care spending and leave most individuals better off.\n\nThe Sanders proposal would more or less eliminate private insurance because it would prohibit employers and private carriers from providing duplicative coverage. Promoters of the idea call this a feature, not a bug, because most people hate dealing with insurance companies anyway. They note, also, that the universal coverage schemes of most countries dramatically minimize or eliminate the role of for-profit insurers.\n\nStill, proponents of the Sanders bill frequently gloss over the variety of universal coverage schemes overseas \u2015 and the ways in which those systems differ from what his version of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would mean here. Wealthier Germans, for example, can opt out of the government system and enroll in private plans, which for-profit insurers sell. Most of the French buy supplemental policies to cover their out-of-pocket costs, which include extra fees that some doctors are allowed to charge.\n\nMore important, perhaps, the national health insurance systems of nearly all those countries date back to the middle of the 20th century, when policymakers looking to enact reforms didn\u2019t have to deal with a private health care financing system as entrenched \u2015 and as expensive \u2015 as the what the U.S. has now.\n\nTrying to pass the Sanders proposal today would mean picking a fight not just with insurers but also with doctors and hospitals, drug and device makers, all of which have been known to protest even relatively moderate threats to their incomes.\n\nThese industries would run ads hammering away at the proposed program\u2019s political vulnerabilities, of which there are many. Surveys have shown consistently that most Americans with private insurance like it, despite the hassles, and that support for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d drops precipitously when respondents hear it would mean having to give up the plans they have.\n\n\u2018Medicare For All\u2019 Isn\u2019t The Only Path To Universal Coverage\n\nPublic opinion isn\u2019t always clear, let alone fixed, so it\u2019s impossible now to know how a debate over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d will play out once both sides make their most compelling arguments. Survey questions referring to upsides of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d push approval higher, just as questions that talk about would-be downsides push it lower.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to see how a politician who believes in universal health care might look at those poll numbers \u2015 and think about the long, frustrating history of comprehensive health care reform \u2015 and opt for changes less sweeping than what Sanders has in mind.\n\nOne option would be a proposal to create a government program that was open to all while giving employers the option to maintain their benefits and giving employees the option of staying with those. Such a plan would be closer to \u201cMedicare for anybody\u201d than \u201cMedicare for everybody,\u201d which is what the Sanders plan envisions. Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) recently introduced such legislation, which mirrors a proposal that the liberal think tank Center for American Progress released last year.\n\nEach of these plans would be subject to substantive and strategic questions, just as the Sanders proposal is. Would the narrower proposals do enough to reduce prices throughout the health care system, so that people who already have insurance would see clear benefits? Would they generate enough enthusiasm from the public to overcome the resistance that even small-bore health care initiatives inevitably raise?

Greg Abbott is still defending his state\u2019s decision, describing it as a legitimate effort to curb illegal voting.\n\n\u201cThis is what you would categorize as a process,\u201d Abbott said at a press conference Thursday morning, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s important to let the data speak for itself.\u201d\n\nSo far, the data indicate that state leaders jumped the gun.\n\nA List Riddled With False Positives\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, middle, isn't worried about his state's disastrous citizenship probe.\n\nTexas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) issued a statement Friday saying his office had identified about 95,000 noncitizens who had registered to vote, including about 58,000 who had cast a ballot at some time over the last two decades. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton echoed the announcement, tagging it on Twitter with the words \u201cVOTER FRAUD ALERT.\u201d By Sunday, President Donald Trump added to the uproar, baselessly calling it the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d and demanding \u201cstrong voter ID\u201d \u2015 despite the fact that Texas already requires photo ID to cast a ballot.\n\nCritics and legal groups contested the allegations, noting that the state had culled the list primarily by checking voter registration records against those maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards. That agency belongs to the state and doesn\u2019t keep updated citizenship records \u2015 it only requires proof of citizenship when people apply for state IDs. That leaves open the possibility that people who naturalized after obtaining or renewing their identification cards would still be flagged.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. With each passing day, it becomes clearer that the secretary of state\u2019s list is riddled with tens of thousands of false positives.\n\nThe office has made lurching and inconsistent steps to solve the problem it created. On Monday, facing a storm of criticism, the secretary of state\u2019s office recalculated the list of suspected noncitizen voters, arriving at a higher figure of 98,000. But a day later, it backtracked, quietly notifying county registrars that thousands of the people named were in fact citizens, the Texas Tribune first reported.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office did not respond to a request for an updated list. But Harris County, which encompasses Texas\u2019s largest city of Houston, so far has struck nearly two-thirds of the 29,341 names from its list of suspected noncitizen voters because they turned out to be citizens, according to County Attorney Douglas Ray. The list also included about 400 duplicates.\n\nThe list sent to El Paso County included a naturalized citizen who works at that county office, election official Lisa Wise told HuffPost. In McLennan County, home to the city of Waco, every one of the 366 original names turned out to be a falsely flagged U.S. citizen, the Waco Tribune-Herald reported.\n\nAnd Galveston County sent out letters this week to 163 suspected noncitizen voters, giving them 30 days to provide proof of citizenship \u2015 only to discover before receiving responses that at least 58 of them were incorrectly identified by the secretary of state\u2019s office. In those 58 cases, county officials sent new letters telling the voters to disregard the first one.\n\nRequests For Information Met With Crickets\n\nBoth the Mexican American Legislative Caucus and a coalition of legal and activist groups demanded that the Republican leadership of Texas rescind the list, without success. The League of United Latin American Citizens filed a federal lawsuit to block the probe Tuesday, and other legal groups are considering litigation.\n\nDemocratic state lawmakers have also used legislative privilege to demand more information about how the secretary of state\u2019s office came up with the list. Those requests are typically filled within a couple of days, but the office has yet to comply, state Rep. Celia Israel (D-Austin) told HuffPost.\n\nThe state\u2019s House Committee on Elections will likely call Whitley to testify within the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to the secretary of state in a public forum and the attorney general, and his staff, and say: How did you cook this idea up?\u201d Israel said. \u201cWhere did it come from? There seems to be some synchronicity to how you guys are messaging.\u201d\n\nIsrael noted that she and her chief of staff met with Whitley the day before he announced the voter probe. But he failed to mention that it was coming.\n\nThe voter investigation came three months after the midterm elections, which saw major gains for Democrats in a majority-minority state where Republicans have long held firm control, despite their demographic disadvantage. Because the historically low Latino voter turnout rate has favored Republicans, critics have viewed the probe as a political stunt aimed at making naturalized citizens fearful of registering to vote.\n\nSome 78 percent of the 98,000 suspected noncitizen voters identified by the Texas Secretary of State in Monday\u2019s list live in counties that voted Democrat in the 2018 U.S. Senate election.\n\nAs the slow-moving debacle over the suspected noncitizen voter probe moves forward with the governor\u2019s blessing, naturalized citizens across the state are left wondering if their voter registrations will be questioned before the next election deadline on April 6.\n\nNaturalized Citizens Left In Limbo\n\nMar\u00eda Garc\u00eda was born in Durango, Mexico, but has lived in the United States since she was 3 months old. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen last May \u2015 in time to cast her first ballot in November\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI was super excited, but I was also very nervous,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how fast the system picks up on the registration. I had tried to confirm \u2015 I was checking on the site every day. When I showed up at the polling booth, I had the little receipt that you get. I had any type of documentation they would possibly ask for.\u201d\n\nWith the deadline to register for the next Texas election only three months away, she now worries that the state\u2019s faulty probe might leave her sitting out the next election \u2015 not only because she is recently naturalized but also because her name might get confused with someone else\u2019s.\n\nI know there are other people who might receive these letters and might receive these calls, and they\u2019ll think they did something wrong and they\u2019ll be scared to vote again. Julieta Garibay, naturalized citizen flagged in Texas voter probe\n\n\u201cMy name is Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, which is the most Latino name to have,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that going to put me at risk for the next elections coming up? We have mayoral elections in Dallas coming up and local positions that are important to me.\u201d\n\nJulieta Garibay of Austin also voted for the first time last year after naturalizing. Fearing the secretary of state might have flagged her, she sent an email to the Travis County voter registrar.\n\nBy Wednesday she got the answer. A county election official called to confirm the list included her name. The official didn\u2019t ask whether Garibay was a citizen.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the county is contesting her registration. Officials in Travis County have already struck 634 people from the list of 4,558 suspected noncitizen voters provided by the state and are investigating further, spokeswoman Tiffany Seward said. Officials aren\u2019t contacting voters about the list yet unless they ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling really mad,\u201d Garibay told HuffPost. \u201cI know there are other people who might receive these letters and might receive these calls, and they\u2019ll think they did something wrong and they\u2019ll be scared to vote again.\u201d\n\nSam Levine contributed reporting.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-dunlap-epa-pfas-chemicals_us_5c591ba3e4b00187b554649f": "David Dunlap, a deputy in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Research and Development, has played a lead role in crafting the EPA\u2019s policies on several toxic chemicals found in drinking water, raising concerns about conflicts of interest due to his previous work at Koch Industries.\n\nPolitico on Monday first reported that Dunlap has helped spearhead the EPA\u2019s policies on a class of chemicals linked to cancer: perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Dunlap was hired in October after working for the chemical giant Koch Industries for more than eight years as a lead expert on water and chemical regulations.\n\nDunlap attended at least nine meetings on the substances during his first six weeks at the agency, according to copies of his calendars obtained by Politico through a Freedom of Information Act request. At the same time, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler was deciding if the agency would choose to regulate some of the most notable chemicals in the PFAS class.\n\nPolitico reported last week that Wheeler ultimately decided not to set a limit for two of the toxic chemicals that have been found in drinking water \u2015 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, or PFOS, and another called perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA. The decision has not yet been made public, but the calendars show Dunlap was involved in the decision-making process shortly after he started at the agency.\n\nA bipartisan group of 20 senators issued a forceful letter urging Wheeler to reconsider this week, saying a failure to regulate the substances \u201cwould be a major setback to states and affected communities.\u201d\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/ASSOCIATED PRESS PFAS, a class of chemicals used in some consumer products, has been linked to cancer and other ailments.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS,\u201d the lawmakers, led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), wrote.\n\nDunlap\u2019s role doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation, but as Politico notes, the president has not appointed anyone to run the EPA\u2019s research office, effectively giving Dunlap broad power to work on the agency\u2019s policies. The agency has an ethics requirement that would prohibit him from working on anything \u201cinvolving specific parties\u201d related to his work at Koch, but it doesn\u2019t appear he\u2019s barred from work on PFAS.\n\nKoch told Politico that the chemicals were not part of his work during his time at the corporation.\n\nAny significant regulation of chemicals like PFAS could require companies that produce them to assume liability for cleanup costs. Georgia-Pacific, a subsidiary of Koch, has used the chemicals in some products it produces and has owned plants where the chemicals were disposed.\n\nThe EPA celebrated Dunlap\u2019s past work at Koch in a statement upon his hiring, saying he would play a \u201cpivotal\u201d role in the EPA\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cAs a chemical engineer, Mr. Dunlap has worked on environmental issues for nearly 30 years with a focus on assessing risk. His extensive experience on regulatory issues will be pivotal in our mission to protect human health and the environment,\u201d Ryan Jackson, the EPA\u2019s chief of staff, told Courthouse News Service after Dunlap was hired.\n\nPolitico\u2019s reporting has set off alarm among public health advocacy groups. The Environmental Working Group said that it hoped Dunlap would follow the EPA mission statement \u201cinstead of the demands of the chemical industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, installs a former Koch executive to clean up toxic chemicals in drinking water, the chances of it happening are about as likely as snowfall in San Diego,\u201d Scott Faber, the group\u2019s senior vice president of government affairs, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope both Wheeler and Dunlap will follow EPA\u2019s mission statement instead of the demands of the chemical industry and adopt a health-protective drinking water standard that will reduce PFAS in the drinking water serving millions of people.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fundraising-for-himself_us_5c54cba5e4b0871047537723": "WASHINGTON \u2015 In an election where Republican House candidates were outraised and outspent, their party\u2019s leader spent $77 million on his own campaign, even though his re-election was two years away.\n\nDonald J. Trump for President and two related campaign committees raised a total of $130 million over the past two years, according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission, with $26 million of that transferred to the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, was outraised $90 million by its Democratic counterpart. Republicans, who held the House since the 2010 election, lost 40 seats and control of the chamber.\n\n\u201cTrump darkens the sun. There is nothing else out there,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a GOP consultant and longtime Trump critic, adding that Trump\u2019s targeting and \u201cbleeding\u201d of small donors meant congressional candidates were less likely to get those contributions.\n\n\u201cSmall donors, those giving $20 or $50, are donors on a limited budget,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTrump has decapitated the party. This is just another example. The money has to go to the cult leader first. It has to go to the king first.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. In previous remarks, Trump has boasted of how hard he worked for GOP candidates with dozens of rallies last summer and fall.\n\n\u201cThis vigorous campaigning stopped the \u2018blue wave\u2019 that they talked about,\u201d he said the morning after the midterm elections while calling the results \u201cvery close to complete victory.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed frequently that his rallies around the country helped Republican candidates, even though the candidates typically appeared on stage with Trump for only a few minutes of an hourlong event at venues that featured primarily Trump signage and placards.\n\nOne Republican official familiar with the House campaigns said that Trump\u2019s insistence on making the focus of the election himself, both in terms of fundraising as well as the themes, was not helpful.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of the backlash of Trump without getting much of the benefit,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity, pointing to Trump\u2019s hammering on illegal immigrants forming caravans to \u201cinvade\u201d the United States as particularly problematic.\n\nRepublicans lost and nearly lost races in California, Texas and Florida because of Trump, the official said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that immigration hurt us in a bunch of places.\u201d\n\nIn a news release Thursday night, the campaign boasted that it had raised $21 million in just the final three months of 2018. \u201cThese totals continue a record fundraising streak for a president\u2019s first eight quarters in office,\u201d the release stated.\n\nWhat the release failed to state was that Trump holds the \u201crecord\u201d because no previous candidate was raising money for re-election so early in his term. President Barack Obama did not start his re-election campaign until April 2011. President George W. Bush opened his re-election account in May 2003.\n\nTrump, in contrast, opened his re-election campaign account the day he was inaugurated in January 2017 and began staging rallies almost immediately. Previous presidents spent their first two years raising money for their parties, for their parties\u2019 congressional committees and, at times, for individual candidates.\n\n\u201cMost presidents help raise money for candidates,\u201d said Al Cardenas, once the state Republican Party chairman in Florida and a close ally of the Bush family. \u201cIs there really justification to suck all the oxygen out of the room so quickly?\u201d\n\nTrump did donate $2,000 each to 106 House and Senate candidates in July, but with House campaigns today often costing millions of dollars, those were of token benefit at best. Trump could have, had he wanted, spent far more money on \u201cindependent expenditures\u201d to benefit candidates in tight races, had he done so without coordinating with the campaign in question.\n\nHe did not, however, and instead most of the money he raised went toward fundraising costs, staging rallies around the country and selling Trump-branded campaign gear. Hundreds of thousands more went to Trump properties that he personally profits from \u2015 $150,167 in the final three months of 2018 to Trump Tower alone, where he rents office space from himself.\n\n\u201cHe had all the money in the world,\u201d Wilson said, adding that some of that could have made the difference in races that were lost by thousands or even hundreds of votes. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he wouldn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump did headline fundraisers for both the NRCC and the National Senatorial Republican Committee as well as help raise $325 million for the Republican National Committee, which helps Republican candidates up and down the ballot.\n\nThat help, though, comes with strict rules and limits attached, and is not as beneficial to the candidates as money raised by the candidates themselves, officials agreed.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-fairfax-virginia-sexual-assault-allegation_us_5c588e9ae4b09293b20730f0": "ASSOCIATED PRESS/Steve Earley/The Virginian-Pilot Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) is one of the only elected officials in Virginia who has not called on Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to resign.\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2015 Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) vehemently denied a sexual assault allegation against him that resurfaced late Sunday, arguing it was timed to derail his potential ascent to the governorship.\n\n\u201cThis allegation is completely false,\u201d Fairfax said at an impromptu press conference in the Capitol rotunda on Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be 40 years old next month. I have lived 40 years accusation-free. And there\u2019s a reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also a reason, at the moment when people ... think that there\u2019s a possibility I might be elevated to the governorship \u2015 it\u2019s at that point that they come out with the attacks and the smears.\u201d\n\nThe woman accusing Fairfax of sexual assault has claimed he forced her to perform oral sex during an encounter that began consensually at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax maintains the encounter was entirely consensual and has threatened legal action to protect his reputation against a claim he called \u201cdefamatory.\u201d\n\nAt Monday\u2019s press conference, he also said the woman accusing him called him months after the encounter in question to try to meet up with her and meet her mother. When pressed for evidence of her subsequent communication, Fairfax said he did not have any because it had happened over the phone.\n\nFairfax has become the subject of national attention in recent days as pressure mounts on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to resign. Virtually every Democratic elected official in the state has withdrawn support for Northam after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page emerged Friday. Northam initially said he appeared in the photo, which shows a man in blackface standing with another man in a Ku Klux Klan uniform, but he subsequently recanted. At a Saturday press conference, Northam nonetheless admitted to another instance of wearing blackface.\n\nFairfax, the second black statewide elected official in Virginia\u2019s history, would succeed Northam if the governor resigned. (Fairfax has not called on Northam to resign; he declined to do so again at Monday\u2019s press conference.)\n\nThe chaos escalated Sunday night as the specter of scandal spread to Fairfax as well.\n\nBig League Politics, the same conservative news site that first published Northam\u2019s yearbook photo, published a screenshot of a social media post by a woman describing her sexual assault accusation against Fairfax.\n\n\u201cImagine you were sexually assaulted during the [Democratic National Convention] in Boston in 2004 by a campaign staffer. You spend the next 13 years trying to forget it ever happened,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cUntil one day you find out he\u2019s the Democratic candidate for statewide office in a state 3,000 miles away, and he wins that election in November 2017. Then by strange, horrible luck, it seems increasingly likely he\u2019ll get a VERY BIG promotion.\u201d\n\nIn the early hours of Monday morning, Fairfax\u2019s staff issued a statement denying the allegation. The statement, co-signed by Fairfax\u2019s chief of staff Lawrence Roberts and communications director Lauren Burke, said The Washington Post had investigated the allegation the previous year and decided not to publish a story on it due to the \u201cabsence of any evidence corroborating the allegation, and significant red flags and inconsistencies within the allegation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lt. Governor will take appropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation,\u201d Roberts and Burke said.\n\nHours later, the Post published its own version of events, denying that it had unearthed any \u201cred flags\u201d when the allegation came to the newspaper\u2019s attention in November 2017.\n\nThe woman described a sexual encounter that began with consensual kissing, but she said she eventually noticed that she could not move her neck. The woman alleged that Fairfax then forced her to perform oral sex through physical coercion, according to the Post.\n\nThe Post did not publish the story in November 2017 because it \u201ccould not find anyone who could corroborate either version,\u201d and it found no evidence of similar allegations after interviewing several people who knew Fairfax in college, law school and during his political career.\n\nFairfax and his staff are sticking by their story, and are accusing the Post of acting without journalistic integrity given its professed inability to corroborate the story.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official,\u201d Burke said in a statement. \u201cWe ask further: What other major elected official in the Commonwealth of Virginia would be smeared with sexual allegations that were presented without corroboration?\u201d\n\nI asked LG Fairfax's team what they make of the Post denying there were \"red flags\" with allegation story.\n\n\n\n\"The Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official.\" Full statement from staff is attached. pic.twitter.com/5rMtlcAenh \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 4, 2019\n\nWhen asked Monday whether he would welcome his accuser to share her story with the legislature, Fairfax did not explicitly reject the idea.\n\n\u201cAnyone is free to speak up and be heard,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a party, Democrats have declared their intolerance of sexual misconduct of any kind.\n\nThey mobilized en masse in an attempt to keep then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the high court after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her at a party in high school. Democrats argued that Ford\u2019s testimony before the Senate was credible and compelling enough to disqualify Kavanaugh from a justice position.\n\nFairfax\u2019s pushback \u2015 in particular, implying that a sexual assault survivor\u2019s allegation is less credible because the accuser reached out to the alleged assailant after the fact \u2015 has already elicited some criticism in progressive circles.\n\nMany sexual assault survivors have described befriending their attackers as a means of coping.\n\nLizzie Hylton, the political director of Clean Virginia, a Virginia-based progressive advocacy, highlighted that research, calling on Fairfax to \u201cstop spreading rape myths.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stacey-abrams-state-of-the-union-democratic-response_us_5c5a36dae4b00187b5560cdf": "WASHINGTON \u2015 In the official Democratic response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, former Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams delivered a passionate speech about the need for economic and social justice in America and said even though she disagrees with Trump on virtually everything, she still wants him to succeed.\n\n\u201cMy reason for running for governor was simple: I love our country and its promise of opportunity for all,\u201d Abrams said, beaming against the blurred backdrop of a group of men and women of different races. \u201cI stand here tonight because I hold fast to my father\u2019s credo: Together, we are coming for America, for a better America.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who is the first black woman to give a Democratic response to the State of the Union, denounced the president\u2019s policies on immigration, LGBTQ rights, gun safety, education and health care. She didn\u2019t need to name the president directly when she urged Americans to hold people \u201cin the very highest offices\u201d accountable for racism. But she did call Trump out directly for shutting down the government last month, making federal workers go without pay for weeks in his push for border wall money.\n\n\u201cMaking their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cThe shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values.\u201d\n\nStill, Abrams extended an olive branch to Trump, urging him to consider how much Democrats and Republicans can accomplish by working together.\n\n\u201cEven as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems, I still don\u2019t want him to fail,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America.\u201d\n\nEven as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems, I still don\u2019t want him to fail.

Abrams lost her governor\u2019s race in November to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) amid allegations of voter suppression. Kemp refused to recuse himself as the state\u2019s top election official in his own election, which many said was a conflict of interest. He also faced scrutiny after his office placed 53,000 voters\u2019 registrations in suspense because their names didn\u2019t exactly match a state record. Nearly 70 percent of the people on the list were black.\n\nAbrams included a call to fight for voting rights in Tuesday night\u2019s response and took a shot at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recently called a group of proposed voting reforms in Democratic legislation a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a \u2018power grab,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders \u2015 not where politicians pick their voters.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Abrams said, the American promise stems from basic family values like the ones she grew up with as her family fluctuated between being lower middle class and working poor.

Greg Abbott, Secretary of State David Whitley and Attorney General Ken Paxton \u2015 and seeks damages if a judge finds that their alleged conspiracy violates the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought on behalf of several Texas voters and three organizations that run voter registration projects, is the latest in a string of legal challenges seeking to overturn a controversial voter probe that Republican leaders cite as evidence of voter fraud, but critics deride as a thinly veiled attempt to suppress the vote of naturalized citizens, who are overwhelmingly of Latin American or Asian birth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear as the purge effort has unraveled over the course of a week and the state officials have refused to withdraw the purge list that their real intentions are not related to maintaining the integrity of the voter rolls,\u201d MALDEF attorney Nina Perales told HuffPost, \u201cbut instead are to take eligible voters off the rolls and intimidate naturalized citizens from voting.\u201d\n\nGetty Editorial Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had called the list evidence of serious voter fraud.\n\nThe MALDEF lawsuit also alleges that the state\u2019s Republican leadership violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause and two Voting Rights Act provisions \u2015 one that bars officials from imposing different voter registration standards for different groups and another that prohibits them from racial discrimination.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Whitley announced that his office had identified some 95,000 suspected noncitizen voters, including 58,000 who had cast a ballot over the last two decades, by checking voter registrations against Department of Public Safety records. The secretary of state then distributed the list to county voter registrars, asking them to send letters verifying those voters\u2019 citizenship by sending a letter asking them to provide proof. Those who fail to respond in 30 days would be scrubbed from the rolls.\n\nPaxton, the attorney general, trumpeted the news the same Friday it was released, calling it evidence of voter fraud. Abbott echoed the sentiment and called for the state Legislature to enact stricter requirements for Texans to register to vote. The issue gained national attention on Sunday when President Donald Trump repeated the claims of voter fraud from his Twitter account, stating them as fact.\n\nBut the list generated by the secretary of state did not provide evidence of a single case of voter fraud, let alone a broad trend involving nearly 100,000 people. DPS, the agency that issues driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, doesn\u2019t keep up-to-date citizenship records, leaving open the possibility that people who obtained a driver\u2019s license before naturalizing as U.S. citizens and registering to vote would get flagged by the state\u2019s probe.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what has happened. Over the course of the week, the secretary of state\u2019s office itself contacted county officials to tell them to disregard tens of thousands of names that state officials had determined within days were actually citizens. The flaws in the process weren\u2019t limited to flagging citizens who naturalized after taking out a state ID \u2015 Harris County, which encompasses Houston, struck some 400 duplicates off its list.\n\nDemocrats characterize the crackdown on suspected noncitizen voting as an attempt to suppress the vote after a midterm election that saw Hispanic turnout skyrocket. Democratic members of the state Legislature, along with more than a dozen civil rights groups, have demanded that Abbott rescind the probe, without success.\n\nIt\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority of people on this list are citizens eligible to vote. Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center\n\nSome 78 percent of those flagged in the secretary of state\u2019s list live in counties that voted Democratic in the 2018 U.S. Senate election.\n\nLegal challenges have been quick to mount. The League of United Latin American Citizens, a Hispanic civic group, sued to block the voter probe Tuesday, alleging that it amounted to voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based nonprofit, joined the LULAC lawsuit Friday, filing an amended class action complaint to the earlier lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Antonio on behalf of Julie Hilberg, a 54-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in the United Kingdom.\n\nHilberg, who lives south of San Antonio in Atascosa County, registered to vote in 2015 and cast her first ballot in the following year\u2019s presidential election. She found that she was on the voter probe list after asking the county registrar, according to CLC attorney Paul Smith.\n\n\u201cThis program is a gratuitous attack on people\u2019s right to vote that has no factual basis,\u201d Smith told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority of people on this list are citizens eligible to vote, but they\u2019re going to get this notice saying they have 30 days to prove their citizenship. It\u2019s inevitable that some of them won\u2019t and they\u2019ll get purged.\u201d\n\nThe amended complaint filed on Hilberg\u2019s behalf Friday also accuses Whitley and Paxton of violating her First Amendment right to the vote as a form of self expression and 14th Amendment right to cast a ballot freely, calling the voter probe an \u201cunconstitutional voter purge.\u201d\n\nPaxton said he welcomed the opportunity to defend the probe after he was first sued on Tuesday. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the amended complaint.\n\nEven as the Republican-led probe unraveled, Abbott praised his administration\u2019s efforts, describing the crackdown launched by the secretary of state\u2019s office as a \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\nRepublican state legislators have also filed bills in both chambers that would codify the flawed process for identifying suspected noncitizen voters and require the secretary of state\u2019s office to perform the checks annually.\n\nBut any process requiring the state to use state driving agency records to verify voter registrations would also surely invite a federal lawsuit, according to Smith.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-wall-national-emergency_us_5c53660be4b01d3c1f11c320": "Evan Vucci/ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump speaks in McAllen, Texas, during a tour of the U.S. border with Mexico on Jan. 10, 2019. Sen. Ted Cruz listens.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 One week into the three-week negotiating period before another possible government shutdown, President Donald Trump yet again demanded that lawmakers give him billions of dollars for a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nHe also hinted that he would declare a national emergency if they did not.\n\nAll while simultaneously claiming \u2015 falsely \u2015 that he has already built and is currently building \u201ca lot\u201d of the wall.\n\nSo went the latest twists Thursday in Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to get U.S. taxpayers to provide the money for a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall that he promised hundreds of times during his campaign he would force Mexico to pay for.\n\n\u201cThere is no wall going up,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential primaries. \u201cSo the only thing to conclude is that Trump is building a fake wall with fake pesos to stop fake caravans to prevent a fake border crisis for which he will declare another fake victory.\u201d\n\nThe president triggered a 35-day government shutdown just before Christmas over the refusal by the then wholly Republican-led Congress to appropriate billions of taxpayer dollars for his signature campaign promise.\n\nA week ago, he signed the exact short-term spending deal \u2015 with no wall money \u2015 that he said he would not sign in December. On Thursday, he said he did so to help the 800,000 federal workers who already had missed a month of pay. He claimed, without evidence, that \u201cmany\u201d of them had wanted him to continue the shutdown to get wall money.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to do it because people were getting hurt,\u201d Trump told reporters following an Oval Office photo opportunity.\n\nHe added that the shutdown had great value because it focused attention on the wall and illegal immigration. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do the shutdown, people wouldn\u2019t know, people wouldn\u2019t understand the subject,\u201d the president said. \u201cNow they understand the subject. They understand what a humanitarian crisis it is.\u201d\n\nThe fact of the matter was it\u2019s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants. A former Trump campaign official, on the president's criticism of the former House speaker\n\nTrump has taken to blaming former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan for failing to get him funds for a wall during Trump\u2019s first two years in the White House, when his own party controlled both chambers of Congress. \u201cI was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed,\u201d he told the conservative website Daily Caller.\n\nBut one former Trump campaign official said the president failed to take advantage of his first-year power when he had it. \u201cThe fact of the matter was it\u2019s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nNow, with the House under the control of Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is facing vocal opposition to his wall rather than just passive resistance. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday, but allowed that she is open to some new barriers in some areas as well as money for better technical monitoring. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nTrump made illegal immigration and caravans of asylum-seekers heading to the border the centerpiece of his midterm election message last year. In speech after speech, he told audiences at his rallies and those watching at home that the migrants would bring crime and drugs and that Pelosi wanted \u201copen borders\u201d and would welcome those people in.\n\nDespite his efforts \u2015 and in some congressional districts, because of them \u2015 Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House. Meanwhile, Republicans, although they had the most favorable Senate election map in decades, picked up only two seats in that chamber.\n\nAs a Dec. 21 government funding deadline approached, Trump resumed talking about caravans and immigrants coming to commit crimes \u2015 including one particularly lurid but apparently apocryphal description of kidnapped women being bound and gagged with duct tape as they\u2019re smuggled across the border.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters that he doubted the House and Senate conference committee negotiators working on a new Department of Homeland Security funding bill would include money for his wall. He acknowledged that he might yet declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d which he believes would let him transfer money from other executive agency accounts to build the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting till Feb. 15,\u201d Trump said, referring to the next shutdown deadline. \u201cOn Feb. 15, the committee will come back. And if they don\u2019t have a wall, I don\u2019t even want to waste my time reading what they have.\u201d\n\nMedia reports from when Trump previously threatened to declare an emergency noted that he was thinking of raiding billions of dollars from the Defense Department\u2019s Army Corps of Engineers budget to repair hurricane damage in places like Puerto Rico and Houston.\n\n\u201cThose are not great ideas,\u201d said Michael Steel, once a top aide to then GOP House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nSteel added that since Democrats seem willing to agree to money for some new physical barriers, he did not fully understand talk about an emergency or another shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kirsten-gillibrand-to-bring-transgender-navy-lieutenant-commander-to-sotu_us_5c5857a8e4b00187b5535d31": "Her announcement comes on the heels of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to allow President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on trans people serving in the military.
