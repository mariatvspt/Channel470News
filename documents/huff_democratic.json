{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid.

National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rod-rosenstein-doj-resignation_n_5c6b6aa8e4b0b9cc78ffa6b2": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein plans to leave the Department of Justice next month following a chaotic tenure that saw him bear the brunt of President Donald Trump\u2019s rage over the ongoing inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBoth Reuters and CNN reported Monday that Rosenstein, a career prosecutor, would step down sometime in mid-March, citing a senior Justice Department official.

Experts said in July 2017 that the Pyongyang had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States,\u201d McCabe said during the interview. \u201cAnd he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIntelligence officials in the briefing responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses to which the president replied, \u2018I don\u2019t care.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-kentucky-school-border_n_5c69ef82e4b01757c36ca404": "Sen.

After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfill his signature campaign pledge, Trump\u2019s declared national emergency Friday shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that his state would sue \u201cimminently\u201d to block the order, after the American Civil Liberties Union and the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen announced Friday they were taking legal action.\n\nDemocrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump \u2014 though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.\n\nThe White House\u2019s Miller insisted that Congress granted the president wide berth under the National Emergencies Act to take action. But Trump\u2019s declaration goes beyond previous emergencies in shifting money after Congress blocked his funding request for the wall, which will likely factor in legal challenges.\n\nTrump aides acknowledge that Trump cannot meet his pledge to build the wall by the time voters decide whether to grant him another term next year, but insist his base will remain by his side as long as he is not perceived to have given up the fight on the barrier.\n\nSen.

I wish he wouldn\u2019t use it in this case. But again, I understand his frustration,\u201d Johnson said Sunday.\n\nWhile six previous presidents collectively declared dozens of national emergencies, Trump\u2019s declaration over a border wall would be the first to finance a project that Congress explicitly refused to pay for.\n\nTrump on Friday signed a spending bill into law that allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 a fraction of the president\u2019s $5.7 billion demand for more than 200 miles of concrete or steel barriers. He said he would obtain an additional $8 billion in part by redirecting billions that Congress approved for Department of Defense military construction projects.\n\nDemocrats hammered the announcement as \u201cunlawful\u201d and vowed to quickly challenge it in the courts.

If approved, the merger would create a \u201ccountry-club market\u201d in which Verizon, AT&T and the new T-Mobile/Sprint could \u201cdivide the market, and collect ever-rising monthly rents from wireless subscribers with few real alternatives,\u201d according to the letter.

Approval authority ultimately rests with the FCC and the Department of Justice.\n\nYet their stated opposition does show that the party\u2019s leading lights feel that it is important to take anti-monopoly stances in their pursuit of the presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party has increasingly embraced anti-monopoly and antitrust policies since the 2016 election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) labeled antitrust policy as one of the key planks in the party\u2019s new platform in a 2017 New York Times op-ed. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the new head of the House antitrust subcommittee, has promised to tackle head-on issues of consolidation in the pharmaceutical, hospital and tech industries.\n\nIn the recent past, Democrats have been more attentive to consolidation concerns in the telecommunications industry than in other sectors in which they allowed countless mergers during the presidency of Barack Obama. That could be due to the extreme consolidation already existing in this space. There are currently only four major mobile service providers \u2015 Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.\n\nThe Obama administration sued to block AT&T from purchasing T-Mobile in 2011 to prevent further consolidation that could raise prices and cost jobs. Then the Obama-era FCC prevented T-Mobile and Sprint from merging in 2014.\n\nThe Democratic Party has increasingly embraced anti-monopoly and antitrust policies since the 2016 election.\n\nThose same concerns exist in this second attempted merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.

Other telecommunications law experts argue that the merger will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers, who already pay among the highest prices for mobile service in the world. Rural mobile service advocates argued that the merger will dramatically increase costs for people living in areas with poor mobile service coverage and do little to improve that coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic 2020 candidates are rightfully expressing concerns and opposition to the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger, but the negative effects and potential damage of the merger should not be a partisan issue,\u201d said Shane Larson, director of legislation, politics and international affairs at the Communications Workers of America.\n\nThe Democratic candidates may be opposed to the merger, but an anti-monopoly spirit has not taken over the party entirely.\n\nRep.

The country\u2019s telecommunications market is already dominated by the duopoly of Verizon and AT&T, she said.

Martha McSally in 2020. He\u2019s a dream candidate: a naval aviator-turned-astronaut who\u2019s made four trips to space, the husband of a Democratic Party star who survived an assassination attempt, a gun control advocate who\u2019s helped a nationwide network of candidates and built a matching network of donors.\n\nHowever, the party\u2019s left wing is holding off on the celebrations for now. Public records show Kelly voted in the 2012 GOP primary while living in Texas, meaning he likely cast a ballot for either Mitt Romney or one of the host of conservatives running against President Barack Obama and either Ted Cruz or David Dewhurst for Senate. (A Kelly spokesperson said he voted for Obama in the general election.)\n\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images Mark Kelly, a gun control advocate, former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, will be a top Democratic contender for Arizona's Senate seat.\n\nAnd progressives both in the state and nationally have long been preparing for Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino veteran of the war in Afghanistan and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to run for the seat. Gallego is still considering a bid, potentially creating an ideological clash with Kelly. It\u2019s one of a host of potentially pugnacious primaries Democrats could face in 2020 as they seek to win back control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Gallego wrote on Twitter Tuesday, the day Kelly announced his campaign. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed.

Gallego isn\u2019t 100 percent certain to run; his team is still investigating whether it could raise the cash necessary to challenge Kelly in a primary.\n\nMcSally, a moderate-turned-Trump ally who narrowly lost the U.S. Senate race to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in November and was appointed to the seat formerly held by the late John McCain in December, is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot in 2020.\n\nA primary battle between Gallego, 39, and Kelly, 54, could be one of several such contests Senate Democrats face this cycle. While it\u2019s still early in the recruiting process \u2015 Arizona\u2019s primary won\u2019t be until August 2020 \u2015 there\u2019s also the potential for intraparty clashes to determine who will face incumbent Republicans in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. Races in those five GOP-held states, along with the Democrats\u2019 defense of seats in Alabama, Michigan and New Hampshire, are likely to determine which party controls the Senate in 2021. (Democrats are also likely to look at redder territory, including Kansas, Kentucky, Montana and Texas.)\n\nIn Colorado, a host of Democrats are likely to compete for the right to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. Two Democrats who have run for statewide office in the past \u2015 former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff and former state Sen. Mike Johnston \u2015 have already entered the race, and another former state House Speaker, Crisanta Duran, is also considering a challenge to Gardner.\n\nIn both Georgia and North Carolina, Democrats are focused on wooing candidates who could clear the field: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s pursuit of former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to run against Sen. David Perdue is no secret, and Democrats are eyeing Attorney General Josh Stein in North Carolina as a challenger to Sen. Thom Tillis. But if either candidate opts against the run, the field would be wide open. In Iowa and Maine, no consensus candidate has emerged but operatives believe women would be best to challenge Sens. Joni Ernst and Susan Collins.\n\nThe Next Mission For An Undefined Candidate\n\nKelly\u2019s strengths are readily apparent. As the leader of Giffords, the gun control group named for his wife, shooting victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), he\u2019s become a high-profile advocate on a key issue for the Democratic base and played a major role in raising and spending more than $17 million for candidates across the country last cycle.\n\nHis introductory video, however, makes little mention of his gun control work, instead focusing on the rest of his biography: The son of a woman who became one of the first female police officers in the 1970s, he joined the Navy, flew combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and become an astronaut alongside his twin brother. He then left NASA to help Giffords with her recovery.\n\nThe sterling biography, however, hides a candidate who is still ideologically undefined. In the launch video, Kelly makes his opposition to gerrymandering and refusal to take corporate PAC money clear, but how he would solve other problems mentioned in the video \u2015 high health care costs, wage stagnation \u2015 is left unsaid.

Rep. Ruben Gallego will try to change that.\n\nFor Gallego to defeat Kelly would be a reversal of a long-standing political trend. Essentially, no progressive Democrat has triumphed in a contested Senate primary for a GOP-held seat since former Rep. Joe Sestak ousted party-switching Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010. Since then, DSCC-endorsed candidates have squashed candidates like now-Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and former Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.\n\nSchumer has worked assiduously over the years to avoid high-profile primaries in states where Democrats are looking to win GOP-held seats. The Senate Democratic leader has largely been successful, defeating a smattering of left-wing candidates. In the past two election cycles, only two Democratic primaries in targeted Senate seats \u2015 Katie McGinty\u2019s 2016 victory in Pennsylvania and Patty Judge\u2019s win in Iowa the same year \u2015 were decided by fewer than 38 percentage points. (Both women eventually lost to incumbent Republicans.)\n\nThe Harvard-educated Gallego, who supports Medicare for All, marijuana legalization and a $15 minimum wage, would be the first Latino to represent Arizona in the Senate. A successful primary campaign would depend on his ability to craft a coalition of Latino voters and progressives. The ability to unite the party\u2019s liberal base with minority voters has been elusive for progressives in Senate races \u2015 endorsements by Obama helped deliver black voters to the establishment candidates in Florida\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate races in 2016.\n\nBut Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, has already teamed up with Latino Victory Fund to launch a digital campaign encouraging Gallego to run.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-chris-wallace-knocks-gop-republicans_us_5c5e7a7ee4b0eec79b238d7c": "Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace has knocked Republicans\u2019 double standard over House investigations into the Trump White House.\n\nWallace said on Friday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cOutnumbered\u201d that he found it \u201ckind of rich that Republicans are so outraged that there would be this kind of a hearing of the other party\u2019s president and administration.\u201d\n\nIt came during an analysis of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not like Republicans sat on their hands when Barack Obama was president,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThey investigated Benghazi, they investigated Fast & Furious, they investigated the IRS, and you know, look, those were all legitimate issues to investigate.

Since he came to power, Maduro has faced internal and international opposition over his authoritarian crackdowns on political dissent, and resistance to his presidency has intensified amid an economic crisis spurred by global declines in oil prices.\n\nMaduro was a subject of debate within the Obama administration, as it weighed whether to sanction the president and top Venezuelan government officials amid allegations of human rights abuses. Obama sanctioned seven Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in 2015, a decision that drew rebukes across Latin America.\n\nThe situation has continued to deteriorate since, and an estimated 3 million refugees and migrants have left the country amid economic turmoil, including spiraling inflation and food and medicine shortages. Maduro won a second term in May 2018, after an election marred by official boycotts from opposition parties and claims that the president had acted to rig the results in his favor. The opposition parties declared the results illegitimate and were joined by the United States, European Union, and several large, influential Latin American democracies.\n\nMaduro has clung to power since Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the legitimate leader on Jan. 23 amid widespread protests both in support of and against the government. Leaning on the support of the armed forces, Maduro opened the door to dialogue with the opposition and Guaid\u00f3 as protests erupted again on Wednesday. But there is no guarantee that the dispute will lead to new elections or come to an immediate resolution, even as the Trump administration has said it will use any means available to remove Maduro from office.\n\nWe cannot control the outcomes [in foreign countries] no matter how much we wish to or thought we could in the 1990s.

Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-federal-agency-staffing-impasse_us_5c632fa0e4b08da0ec7fb62a": "Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Jan. 9, before a meeting with President Donald Trump on the partial government shutdown. The stalemate over unfilled posts at federal agencies is just as serious.\n\nThere\u2019s an important battle brewing between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats, one with serious implications for the way the country is governed. No, I\u2019m not referring to the prospect of another government shutdown, though that is serious. I mean the actual staffing of the government, the top officials who run our federal agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s a contest with high stakes, particularly for Democrats, who control few levers of power in Washington, despite their new majority in the House of Representatives. And yet the tussle over regulatory nominations has flown under the radar in political media, obscured by more explosive confrontations.\n\nFor several months now, the Trump administration has kept Wall Street watchdog posts vacant by sitting on Democratic nominations. And for months progressive political organizations have been leaning on Senate Democrats to do something \u2015 anything \u2015 about it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is unprecedented,\u201d according to Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research. \u201cAnd the Democrats are allowing Republicans to do it without exerting either tactical leverage or rhetorical leverage by speaking out against it.\u201d\n\nMost federal agencies have a chairperson or top-level official who runs the show. The president gets to select that person, and while Democrats can cry foul over nominees they don\u2019t like, there isn\u2019t a whole lot they can do without Republican help to block a Trump candidate for these jobs.\n\nBut Democrats do have influence over a host of other positions that wield real power. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, is designed to be bipartisan \u2015 two of the five commissioners that run the agency can\u2019t come from the president\u2019s party. While the Republican majority will always have the final say, there\u2019s a lot that a Democratic commissioner can do \u2015 document corporate abuses, lean on enforcement staff and negotiate with Republicans over the regulatory agenda.\n\nConsider the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra published a pointed memo about the need to punish \u201crecidivist\u201d corporate offenders. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Facebook, which has been operating under a consent order from the FTC since 2011. Under the order, Facebook had agreed to reform the way it tracked user data and shared those data with other companies. If Facebook violated the terms of that order \u2015 and the company\u2019s mounting heap of scandals makes it seem increasingly likely that it did \u2015 then, Chopra suggested, the FTC should take strong punitive measures to demonstrate that large corporations are not above the law.\n\nChopra can\u2019t force the Republican-controlled FTC to actually do anything. But his memo made quite a splash. Where in the past, weak regulators might have hurried to absolve Facebook with a slap-on-the-wrist penalty, Republicans at the FTC now face the prospect of public humiliation if they carry water for the tech company during its ongoing meltdown.\n\nChopra is one of the few Democratic nominees to make it through the Trump administration logjam. Last summer, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recommended Trump fill open Democratic posts at the SEC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with longtime regulator Allison Lee and FDIC veteran Martin Gruenberg. In November, he recommended Graham Steele, a former staffer to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), for another FDIC post. Previous presidents quickly shepherded such recommendations to the Senate, but Trump has yet to formally nominate any of them. He has, however, found time to move ahead with installing a Republican replacement for outgoing Federal Housing Finance Chairman Mel Watt.\n\nIn December, Trump picked Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief economist Mark Calabria for the job. Calabria is a libertarian true-believer who advocates a return to the gold standard and has called to eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing giants he would regulate if confirmed as FHFA chairman. Calabria is scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\n\nLate last month, 20 progressive organizations signed a letter chastising Senate Democrats for inaction on Democratic appointees. By blocking or delaying Republican nominees, the groups wrote, Democrats could pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) into a deal in which the idle Democratic candidates are approved alongside Republicans \u2015 as was customary in previous administrations.\n\nSome of those progressive groups are now specifically calling for Democrats to block the Calabria nomination by placing a hold on it until other Democratic nominees are allowed to come to the floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible,\u201d said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, a net-roots group that focuses on contesting corporate power.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer and rank-and-file members of his caucus to step up and make sure that these positions are filled as soon as possible. David Segal, Demand Progress\n\nIt\u2019s essentially a continuation of last year\u2019s fight between progressives and Schumer over the confirmation of federal judges. At the time, Schumer came under heavy fire for agreeing to confirm large batches of judges by unanimous consent, without securing any Democratic priorities in exchange \u2015 though Schumer (dubiously) argued that letting Democrats go home and campaign without missing votes would help them in the November election. But while Schumer took all of the heat last year, he was acting on behalf of his caucus. Senate Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, were happy to avoid a confrontation.\n\nPrivately, some Democratic staffers continue to insist they have no power. McConnell has final say over confirmation votes, they argue, and if he wants to bring up only Republican nominees, he can. Fighting, the thinking goes, will inevitably result in losing.\n\nBut one aide to a Democratic senator told HuffPost that Calabria\u2019s nomination will not be confirmed by unanimous consent, suggesting that someone \u2015 the aide did not specify who \u2015 will put a hold on the nomination.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats can\u2019t force McConnell or Trump to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. But they can create headaches for them, eating up valuable time on the Senate calendar by demanding that every GOP nomination proceed to a full floor vote. Approving candidates by unanimous consent is faster and leaves the Republican majority with more time to do what it wants to do. McConnell might very well prefer the calendar time to annoying floor fights and bad press from sabotaging the bipartisan nomination process.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aaron-sorkin-democrats-young-people_us_5c455b68e4b027c3bbc31066": "They now need to stop acting like young people, OK?

The complaint has been sent but not yet officially received by the FEC.\n\n\u201cMr. Schultz cannot continue to skirt the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements by publicly stating that he has not made a final decision regarding his candidacy if such a decision has already been made,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nBy law, any individual \u201ctesting the waters\u201d is allowed to spend money \u201cconducting polling, traveling around a district or state, and placing telephone calls to see if there is sufficient support for a candidacy.\u201d But there are also certain activities that indicate an individual has moved beyond that phase, which American Bridge believes Schultz might have already done.\n\n\u201cThe FEC should immediately investigate whether Howard Schultz has engaged in activities that went beyond merely \u2018testing the waters\u2019 for a presidential campaign and instead made expenditures to further his own candidacy for president,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nSuch activities include \u201craising more money than what is reasonably needed,\u201d \u201cusing general public political advertising to publicize their intention to campaign\u201d and \u201cconducting activities over a protracted period of time or shortly before the election.\u201d Candidates need to register with the FEC in those cases if they \u201cif they have raised or spent more than $5,000.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement, a Schultz spokesperson dismissed the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that our activities are fully compliant with the applicable rules,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFurthermore, meritless complaints like this are commonly filed to harass political opponents and are indicative of the problems in Washington.\u201d\n\nOf particular concern to American Bridge is a Washington Post report from last month that stated Schultz has been \u201claying the groundwork for paid advertising that could debut in the next two months\u201d during \u201ca months-long effort to prepare an independent presidential campaign against the nation\u2019s two-party political system.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy \u2018laying the groundwork for paid advertising,\u2019 Mr. Schultz has gone beyond the scope of the testing-the-water exemption and has become a candidate for federal office,\u201d American Bridge contends.\n\nAmerican Bridge is additionally concerned by a link on Schultz\u2019s website that suggests various ways people can \u201cget involved,\u201d including \u201cvolunteering,\u201d \u201chosting an event\u201d and \u201chelping to spread the word,\u201d though those concerns are not included in the complaint. Schultz is currently in the middle of a book tour, but Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for American Bridge, said those options are more in line with Schultz\u2019s political aspirations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable to pretend that some of those options are about a book tour and not about a campaign,\u201d Bates said.\n\nAmerican Bridge, which was founded by David Brock of Media Matters for America and is financially supported by the likes of George Soros, describes itself as a \u201ca progressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable.\u201d But it has made a special exception for the billionaire former Starbucks CEO \u2015 a self-described former \u201clifelong Democrat\u201d who is now \u201cseriously\u201d considering running for president \u201cas a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system.\u201d\n\nDemocrats fear Schultz could pull votes away from their candidate should he run, improving President Trump\u2019s odds of re-election in 2020. Early polling has indicated he would pull more support from Democrats than Republicans.\n\nSchultz himself has said that he will weigh such fears in his ultimate decision. \u201cI can assure you, no one wants Donald Trump fired more than I,\u201d he recently said during a speech at Purdue University. But American Bridge isn\u2019t waiting to find out where Schultz will land.

Amid wide expectation that he will launch a bid for the presidential nomination in 2020, O\u2019Rourke evoked key themes he honed while campaigning across the state \u2015 calling for a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and urging the country to welcome asylum seekers.\n\nIn stark contrast to Trump\u2019s doomsday vision of a crime-infested region under assault from foreign criminals, O\u2019Rourke offered a glowing vision of the border zone. Noting that migrants are statistically less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, O\u2019Rourke insisted that cities like El Paso, his hometown, are among the country\u2019s safest precisely because of their strong immigrant presence.\n\n\u201cIn El Paso, we are secure because we treat one another with dignity and respect. That is the way that we make our communities and our country safe,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at the event. \u201cWe know that walls do not save lives.

It doesn't get more symbolic than this. pic.twitter.com/CTnKThq2kh \u2014 Roque Planas (@RoqPlanas) February 12, 2019\n\nThe speech marked O\u2019Rourke\u2019s first foray onto the national stage since conceding the Senate race to Republican Ted Cruz in November. Since then, he has maintained a low profile, rarely speaking to the press and offering only oblique remarks about whether he will launch a presidential bid. He told Oprah Winfrey earlier this month that he would decide before the month was out \u2015 a remark he repeated to supporters who shouted the question at him during Monday\u2019s event.\n\nBut the crowd seemed optimistic. Several people waved flags reading \u201cBeto for president\u201d or \u201cBeto 2020.\u201d The banners employed the same black-and-white graphics used in his Senate race, which saw voter turnout more than double in some border counties.\n\nO\u2019Rourke addressed the crowd at the same time Trump took the stage for his own rally just a few miles away. The president flew to the border city to make yet another public demand for $5.7 billion to begin construction on a border wall. Similar demands led to the country\u2019s longest government shutdown shortly before Christmas and lawmakers have been stymied thus far in their efforts to negotiate with the White House on a government funding package that would keep the nation running for the rest of the year.\n\nTrump cited El Paso in his State of the Union speech last week in an appeal to obtain money for the border wall, falsely claiming that the city was among the country\u2019s most violent until the federal government began fencing it off from its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. (In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nIt was those remarks, along with Trump\u2019s choice to hold a campaign rally in the heavily Latino border town, that prompted more than 50 civil rights and advocacy groups to organize the rally where O\u2019Rourke delivered the final address.\n\nTrump doubled down on his calls for a wall on Monday, saying his plans along the Rio Grande separating the U.S. and Mexico were already moving forward.\n\n\u201cToday we started a big beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande,\u201d Trump told supporters at the event, which was filled to capacity. \u201cRight smack on the Rio Grande.\u201d\n\nThe size of the crowds at the dual rallies symbolized a wider schism between the values of two social movements that will likely define the politics of 2020 \u2015 one fixated on security that views the border as a threat and an alternate view that champions openness.\n\nThe president addressed the lawmaker\u2019s competing event before flying out of Washington, telling reporters that he had a \u201cvery long\u201d line at his rally and that, though O\u2019Rourke had one too, \u201cit\u2019s a tiny, little line.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally, however, began with a large march through El Paso.

Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax would replace Northam \u2015 but he would do so under the cloud of a sexual misconduct allegation that just became public.

But in Virginia\u2019s latest \u201ccan you believe this\u201d moment, Herring on Wednesday fessed up to his own youthful incident of racism.\n\nAll this in a state where Democrats had been riding a strong wave of political momentum.\n\nThe wildfire of political chaos began when the racist image surfaced on Northam\u2019s 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook page, which also features images of the medical school graduate and his name artfully written in calligraphy at the top.\n\nEastern Virginia Medical School A 1984 yearbook page for Gov. Ralph Northam shows two men in racist garb, though it remains unclear which, if either, is Northam.\n\nBacklash to the image was swift, with top Democratic leaders both inside the state and out calling for Northam\u2019s resignation. The disgraced governor immediately issued an apology, saying he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now.\u201d\n\nBut then, Northam changed his story the following day, suddenly adamant that he was not in the photo. In a weekend press conference, Northam argued he would have had a clear memory of being in blackface or a KKK robe, because he did have a clear memory of a time he did wear blackface.\n\n\u201cThat same year [as the yearbook\u2019s release] I did participate in a dance contest... in which I darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume,\u201d Northam told reporters. Providing elaboration when none were necessarily needed, he added that he won the contest by imitating the late pop singer\u2019s signature move \u2015 the moonwalk.\n\nA reporter asked if the governor could still moonwalk. Northam appeared to mull the idea over before his wife, standing by his side, chided him for considering even considering it under \u201cinappropriate circumstances\u201d \u2015 during a press conference about him being in blackface.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that a source close to Northam said the governor intended to hire a private investigator to examine the blackface/KKK photo. Nine of his former medical school classmates expressed support for Northam, issuing a statement that said they believe he is not in the photo.\n\nAs the furor built around Northam, attention quickly focused on Fairfax \u2015 who is black and has been viewed as a rising political star. But just two days after Northam\u2019s bizarre press conference, Fairfax faced his own troubles after an allegation of sexual assault against him surfaced. A woman claimed Fairfax assaulted her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\nIn a statement, Fairfax denied the claim. Meanwhile, NBC News reported that in a private meeting about the accusation on Monday, he said \u201cfuck that bitch,\u201d referring to the woman. Fairfax has denied using that phrase.\n\nNow comes the admission by Herring \u2015 who also seemed to have a promising political future \u2015 that he wore \u201cbrown makeup\u201d during a 1980 college party in which he wanted to look like musician Kurtis Blow. In his apology, Herring said \u201chonest conversations\u201d would ensue about whether he should continue to serve.\n\n\u201cThat I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nWhile dazed Virginians wait to see if other scandals emerge, they\u2019re at least getting a civics lesson on their state\u2019s line of gubernatorial succession.\n\nIf Northam, Fairfax and Herring all step down, Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox \u2015 a Republican \u2015 would become governor. But freak circumstances surround even Cox\u2019s position.\n\nGOP control of the state House of Delegates \u2015 and Cox\u2019s selection as speaker \u2015 occurred after a tie for a House seat in the state\u2019s November 2017 election was settled in favor of a Republican.

She didn\u2019t need to name the president directly when she urged Americans to hold people \u201cin the very highest offices\u201d accountable for racism. But she did call Trump out directly for shutting down the government last month, making federal workers go without pay for weeks in his push for border wall money.\n\n\u201cMaking their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cThe shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values.\u201d\n\nStill, Abrams extended an olive branch to Trump, urging him to consider how much Democrats and Republicans can accomplish by working together.\n\n\u201cEven as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems, I still don\u2019t want him to fail,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America.\u201d\n\nEven as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems, I still don\u2019t want him to fail.

Abrams lost her governor\u2019s race in November to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) amid allegations of voter suppression. Kemp refused to recuse himself as the state\u2019s top election official in his own election, which many said was a conflict of interest. He also faced scrutiny after his office placed 53,000 voters\u2019 registrations in suspense because their names didn\u2019t exactly match a state record. Nearly 70 percent of the people on the list were black.\n\nAbrams included a call to fight for voting rights in Tuesday night\u2019s response and took a shot at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recently called a group of proposed voting reforms in Democratic legislation a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a \u2018power grab,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders \u2015 not where politicians pick their voters.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Abrams said, the American promise stems from basic family values like the ones she grew up with as her family fluctuated between being lower middle class and working poor.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Monday that her guest for the State of the Union would be Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist who was furloughed during the shutdown.\n\nPesiri-Dybvik\u2019s husband is an air traffic controller and was required to work without pay during the lapse in appropriations. The family\u2019s home burned down in the 2017 Thomas fire.\n\n\u201cSince the tragic loss of their home, Trisha, Jed, and their three children have worked diligently to bounce back and reestablish a sense of normalcy in their lives, even amidst an unnecessary government shutdown that caused both of them to miss their paychecks for over a month,\u201d Harris said in a statement.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said Monday that she had invited Frank Lagunas, an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, to attend Trump\u2019s address. Lagunas works as a project manager for the EPA\u2019s Superfund division and was furloughed during the recent shutdown.\n\n\u201cI want to show President Trump how his hostage-taking of American workers has a continuing impact on the lives of every day citizens, especially those who are dedicated to the public good,\u201d Schakowsky said in a release.\n\nTrump is set to deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had earlier asked him to postpone the speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, until the shutdown was over. When he initially refused to do so, she said she would not take the necessary steps to allow the address to proceed.\n\nAfter Trump announced a plan on Jan. 25 to reopen the government for three weeks, Pelosi invited him to deliver the address on Feb. 5.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, Trump has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.\n\nPesiri-Dybvik said in a statement that federal workers feel added stress because of \u201cthe looming uncertainty of another potential shutdown.\u201d\n\nIn his announcement about reopening the government, Trump promised that federal employees who had been affected by the shutdown would get backpay \u201cvery quickly or as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBut workers like Lila Johnson, a general cleaning services contractor at the Department of Agriculture, probably won\u2019t see any lost wages. Many government contractors \u2015 from food workers and janitors to security services and computer software developers \u2015 were also furloughed or received stop-work orders during the shutdown. But unlike federal employees, they likely won\u2019t receive backpay.\n\nJohnson will join Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) at the SOTU address, his office said.\n\n\u201cLow- and middle-wage federal contract workers who were locked out of their jobs during the shutdown have been stuck with mounting bills and no back pay,\u201d Van Hollen said in a statement.\n\nVan Hollen and Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) last month introduced the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act to ensure government contractors are paid for lost wages due to the shutdown.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the Senator inviting me to join him for the State of the Union to highlight the need for federal service contractors to be treated fairly,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI know he is fighting for us, and I\u2019m grateful for his efforts.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donor-shunned-gillibrand-over-franken-backs-kamala-harris_us_5c5864ebe4b09293b206cfe1": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign over sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nAbout 13 months ago, Susie Tompkins Buell became one of the first high-profile Democratic donors to publicly condemn Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) for the role she played in calls that led Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign his seat amid sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nBuell, a prominent California fundraiser, has long championed female politicians. But her comments, just days after Franken left office, made national news, highlighting the lingering support from him \u2015 and anger at Gillibrand \u2015 among some members of the Democratic donor class.\n\n\u201cI have supported [Gillibrand] for many years. Will I going forward? To be determined,\u201d Buell told The New York Times in January 2018. She added that she was also considering whether to withdraw support from other Democratic senators who had joined Gillibrand in saying Franken needed to go.\n\nYet last week, Buell went ahead and announced that she was supporting Sen. Kamala Harris of California in the already crowded field for the Democratic presidential nomination. Her backing comes despite the fact that Harris also called for Franken\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cI was not planning on having any strong feelings about the 2020 elections this early in the cycle with many other hopefuls yet to announce,\u201d Buell wrote in her newsletter, which was shared with HuffPost by her office. \u201cBut Senator Harris\u2019s campaign rollout has been so strong and so encouraging that I am compelled to get behind her now.\u201d\n\nGillibrand was the first Democratic senator to publicly say Franken should resign in December 2017, but only by minutes. More than two dozen of her Democratic colleagues later did the same.\n\nBuell did not return a request for an interview.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Top Democratic donor Susie Tompkins Buell of California (right), has decided to support Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) in the race for the party's 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nGillibrand has largely borne alone the brunt of the criticism over the forced departure of Franken, who was popular among the Democratic base for his often biting criticisms of President Donald Trump.\n\nGillibrand\u2019s detractors saw her an \u201copportunist\u201d who was positioning herself for a 2020 presidential run. Her party colleagues \u2015 including other 202 presidential contenders \u2015 have not faced the same blame over their stance on Franken.\n\nSo far, the Franken issue doesn\u2019t seem to be significantly hurting Gillibrand among Democratic activists (except, perhaps, in Minnesota) and voters, as much as it is with a certain class of donors. Indeed, the first endorsement Gillibrand received in Iowa for her presidential bid came from the chair of the state party\u2019s Stonewall Caucus, which focuses on LGBTQ advocacy. The chair specifically cited the senator\u2019s stance on Franken as a reason to back her.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign declined to comment on Buell\u2019s criticisms and whether Gillibrand has been unfairly singled out on the Franken issue.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-raise-a-black-activist_n_5c6434e7e4b03de94297da0a": "Dinnertime rules at the Daughtry house were clear. Gospel, even. No adult or child, no matter how young, had permission to leave the dining table until the day\u2019s political news had been thoroughly digested. And in the Brooklyn household of Revs. Herbert and Karen Daughtry, two prominent black activists from the \u201960s to the present day, there was a lot of politics to get through.\n\nKaren Daughtry, reflecting on how those dinners helped shape their children, said they \u201csat through all of the discussions that [her husband] and I were having. I think that out of that soil, there came a hunger at a young age which took root.\u201d\n\nTheir eldest, Leah Daughtry, would go on to become a prominent political figure whose posts have included serving as CEO of two Democratic National Conventions, as well as a reverend in her own right.\n\n\u201cThey grew up with an inquisitiveness,\u201d Karen Daughtry said, pointing to the walls of the Hose of the Lord Church in Brooklyn where her husband serves as presiding minister. On display are many figures of black activism, including the late Stokely Carmichael, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and Harry Belafonte, who flocked to the Daughtrys\u2019 church over the years.\n\nThis kind of parenting \u2014 in which children were seen as an integral part of the civil rights movement and considered as intellectually capable as adults \u2014 was mirrored in the activist roles that Karen Daughtry herself took on. Just as women were beginning to break out of the domestic roles expected of them in the \u201960s and \u201970s, she chaired the organization Sisters Against South African Apartheid.\n\nIndeed, as some of the earliest voices speaking out against apartheid in the \u201970s, the Daughtry family forged a political path that each member described to me as \u201clonely.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo give your life for a cause, to build a better world, to bring people together, to give your life for your family\u2019s future, is, in one sense, lonely, and often agonizing,\u201d Herbert Daughtry said. \u201cBut on the other side, there\u2019s a deep fulfillment that my life is committed to a cause to make the world better for all people.\u201d\n\nWhen he was arrested for civil disobedience at a rally pushing for freedom for the then imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela that he organized in 1986 outside the South African Mission in Manhattan, it was a family affair.\n\n\u201cEverybody went to jail. You know, I told them that we all going to jail together, so Leah is a jailbird,\u201d he said, a glint in his eye as he recalled the memory.\n\nNot long after Mandela was freed a few years later, the Daughtry family welcomed him to New York, having championed his cause from afar. His wife Winnie Mandela, a fellow political powerhouse, visited the family\u2019s church to thank them for the work they had done outside of South Africa to raise awareness of apartheid.\n\n\u201cIt was just a singular moment in my life to just see this woman who was so bigger than life, now standing as close as you and I are,\u201d Leah Daughtry reminisced as we talked in her parents\u2019 church.\n\nShe said people such as Winnie Mandela, Betty Shabazz (the widow of Malcolm X) and her own mother were powerful forces in Leah\u2019s life: They proved to her that women could inhabit far more than the domestic tropes familiar during her childhood. As often as they were taking care of children or cooking meals, the women in Leah Daughtry\u2019s life were organizing marches and speaking at rallies.\n\n\u201cI grew up with an idea that woman could do anything \u2014 could be anything. That there weren\u2019t any limits on my possibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was very confusing for me when I entered the regular world.\u201d\n\nWhen she did enter that world as a political operative, she became one of the most prominent women of color in Democratic politics. She helped shape Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s 1984 presidential campaign, and then supervised the party\u2019s 2008 and 2016 national conventions in \u201908 and \u201916.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) announced her Green New Deal resolution last Thursday in front of the Senate.\n\nA majority of likely 2020 voters supports key aspects of a Green New Deal even when faced with potential costs and downsides, but strict regulations to decarbonize the nation\u2019s top polluters could trigger a backlash, according to a new poll from proponents of the policy.\n\nThe survey, released by the think tank Data for Progress and shared with HuffPost, found net support for a range of policies, including improving drinking water infrastructure, reforesting land, providing job training and insurance to displaced workers and guaranteeing clean-energy jobs.\n\n\u201cAt the core, the Green New Deal is about a moral imperative to transform our economy and improve people\u2019s lives for the better,\u201d said Greg Carlock, the researcher at Data for Progress and architect of the first Green New Deal blueprint published last September. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on that, but even when you do, people still support it.\u201d\n\nBut faced with a range of possible price tags, voters\u2019 support varied, suggesting costs could factor high into the Green New Deal\u2019s political viability. The results showed a majority of voters would likely oppose policies with stringent mandates \u2015 rules requiring all cars be electric by 2030 and every fossil fuel power plant close by 2035.\n\nTo test the support, Data for Progress commissioned the Democratic pollster Civis Analytics to survey 3,496 likely voters between Jan. 4 - 26 on 11 policies expected to be included a Green New Deal. The poll tested four different cost scenarios on each question, randomly alternating between zero, low, medium and high prices to test how the cost of a policy weighed on one-quarter of respondents\u2019 opinions.\n\nThe green jobs guarantee, considered by Green New Deal proponents to be the heart of the suite of policies, proved one of the tricker components. In a lengthy prompt, the survey asked respondents if they support or oppose a policy that Democrats promised would \u201cguarantee an environmentally friendly job to every American adult, with the government providing jobs for people who can\u2019t find employment in the private sector.\u201d\n\nThe question described the job as a position that would pay \u201cat least $15 an hour, included healthcare benefits, and collective bargaining rights.\u201d The surveyors added that Republicans warned the policy \u201cwould increase the national debt, endanger the long term health of our economy, and this policy will end up paying people who can\u2019t contribute in the job market to perform pointless busy work.\u201d\n\nThirty-nine percent supported the green jobs guarantee, 33 percent opposed and 27 didn\u2019t know. Without a price, voters were 9 percentage points likelier to support than oppose the policy. At a low of $100 billion, support hit 2 percentage points. Voters were about evenly divided on policies costing $500 billion or $1 trillion.\n\nMandates requiring the country to generate 100 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2050 enjoyed sweeping support. The question noted that Democrats believed such a policy would \u201ckickstart the renewable energy sector, creating jobs for many Americans and ensuring that America leads the world in green technology,\u201d while Republicans said, \u201cthis would take away freedom from American consumers, put people out of work, and raise prices for everything from transportation to consumer goods.\u201d\n\nThirty-eight percent supported the proposal, 33 percent opposed and 30 percent didn\u2019t know. Without a price, voters backed the policy by 7 percentage points. At a low of $25 billion, that figure fell to 2 percentage points. Support held steady at 1 percentage point for both a medium cost of $37.5 billion and a high of $50 billion. Age impacted support at the unstated price level. Voters aged 18 to 34 supported the policy by 15 percentage points, while those 65 and older opposed the policy by 11 percentage points.\n\nPolicies improving drinking water infrastructure proved to be the most popular. The survey outlined a proposal to improve infrastructure \u201cand replace lead pipes,\u201d considering that Republicans \u201csay that our drinking infrastructure is in good shape already, and this represents a wasteful use of resources that will burden our children with debt.\u201d\n\nHalf of the respondents supported the proposal, 21 percent opposed and 29 percent didn\u2019t know. At no stated price, voters supported the proposal by 36 percentage points. Faced with a low cost of $25 billion, support sank to 27 percentage points. At a medium cost of $37.5 billion, the percentage dropped to 23. At a high of $50 billion, it fell to 22 percentage points.\n\nThe least popular policy was one \u201cproposing requiring that all new cars sold be electric by 2030.\u201d The question said, \u201cDemocrats say this would help stop climate change, save thousands of lives by reducing pollution, and make the U.S. the definitive leader in the electric car industry.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say this would take away freedom from American consumers, put people making cars out of work, and make new cars unaffordable for the average American. Do you support or oppose this policy?\u201d\n\nJust 26 percent supported the policy, with 44 percent opposed and 33 percent unsure. Without even seeing a price, voters opposed the electric car mandate by 15 percentage points.\n\nThe second-least popular was a proposal \u201crequiring that all fossil fuel plants (coal, natural gas and oil) cease operating by 2035\u201d in an effort to \u201chelp stop climate change\u201d that Republicans say \u201cwould put many Americans out of work, and could lead to an energy crisis as energy prices soar.\u201d\n\nVoters opposed the measure by 3 percentage points, again without seeing a price.\n\nThe findings come just weeks before the Senate is expected to hold a vote on the Green New Deal resolution Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) released last week. The measure, essentially a political statement outlining the scope of what\u2019s needed to prepare the U.S. for a rapidly warming climate, staked out an ambitious list of policies to protect vulnerable communities already suffering from pollution.\n\nIn what Green New Deal supporters called a cynical ploy to up halt their movement\u2019s growing momentum, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a veteran climate change denier who\u2019s taken millions from the fossil fuel industry, vowed this week to hold a vote, forcing swing-state senators to take positions on a policy Republicans are aggressively working to vilify.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans understand climate change is happening and human-caused emissions are the primary cause. In December, 81 percent of registered voters supported the goals of the Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans, according to a poll from Yale and George Mason universities. But the pollsters warned that the overwhelming bipartisan support could erode as the Green New Deal became more closely associated with individual politicians.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, the grassroots climate advocacy group whose thousands of volunteers helped propel the Green New Deal into the national stage in November with a series of protests against top Democrats, said Wednesday it would ramp up actions confronting both Democrats and swing-state Republicans, urging them to support the policy. Groups like Justice Democrats, the left-wing organization that helped run Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, and Data for Progress vowed to aid efforts to primary any Democrats who oppose the Green New Deal.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-democrats-battle-for-black-voters-in-south-carolina-new-york-and-dc_us_5c464024e4b027c3bbc480dd": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2015 The battle for black voters in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary has begun in earnest, a sign of how crucial candidates and strategists view the bloc to a successful campaign.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, two potential candidates, spoke at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally organized by the NAACP outside the statehouse here. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden all spoke at Washington, D.C., events sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) jumped into the race at her alma mater in Washington with a logo designed to invoke Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for a major party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nThe maneuvering, which is starting nearly a year before voters will cast their first primary ballots, is about more than getting a leg up in South Carolina, the third state to vote in the presidential primaries and the only early state with a heavy proportion of black voters. It\u2019s about winning the nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe voters that will determine the next primary winner are going to be African-American women,\u201d said former South Carolina state legislator Bakari Sellers, expressing a sentiment widely shared by Democratic operatives nationally.\n\nAfter both President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination with a coalition heavy on African-American voters, the new conventional wisdom says the candidate with the most success among black voters \u2015 especially black women, who made up 37 percent of the 2016 primary vote, according to exit polling \u2015 has the simplest path to victory.\n\nSean Rayford via Getty Images Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), left, and Sen.

They walked with Brenda Murphy, president of the state's NAACP chapter.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Columbia Mayor Stephen Benjamin told the hundreds gathered outside South Carolina\u2019s state Capitol, which still features a prominent monument to the Confederate War dead. \u201cThe road to the White House starts in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe three candidates best positioned to succeed in South Carolina, according to most operatives, are Biden, who retains a network of supporters there from his two prior runs for president, along with Harris and Booker, who are both African-American. Following her 2020 campaign announcement Monday morning, Harris is scheduled to visit the state Friday. (Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is set to make a trip here Wednesday.)\n\nThe challenge with black voters may be greatest for Sanders, who faltered here in 2016 after shocking Clinton with a victory in New Hampshire. Since then, Sanders and his allies have worked assiduously to woo black voters, and he\u2019s begun to mention racial discrimination more in his stump speech, bluntly calling Trump a \u201cracist\u201d during his speech here. The 77-year-old Vermonter, who famously dislikes discussing his biography, mentioned he traveled to Washington as a college student and heard King deliver his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\n\u201cLet us not forget that the title of that march was for Jobs and Freedom,\u201d Sanders said at the rally, invoking the organizers\u2019 call for an increased minimum wage, a federal job guarantee and more affordable housing. \u201cRacial equality must be central to combating economic inequality if we are to build an economy that works for all of us.\u201d\n\nSanders drew loud applause as he tied his push for progressive policies, such as free college tuition, to the black community, noting African-Americans in particular struggle with student loan debt. Sanders also called for automatic voter registration for every American and \u201cmaking the right to vote a constitutional right,\u201d as well as ending the war on drugs, minimum sentences and private prisons.\n\nBishop Roderick Sumpter, a 52-year-old from St. Stevens, said his impression of Sanders improved after seeing him at the rally and a subsequent town hall.\n\n\u201cIt makes a difference seeing the person talk than looking at them on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can really feel the impression and see the emotion \u2015 that it\u2019s not phony. It\u2019s for real.\n\nStill, operatives in the state remain skeptical of Sanders\u2019 chances.\n\n\u201cI would expect him [Bernie Sanders] to do far worse this year,\u201d said Brady Quirk-Garvan, the chairman of the Charleston Democratic Party. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a strong coalition of Sanders supporters in the state, and I think that number dwindles when you\u2019ve got other progressives in the race.\u201d\n\nBooker drew a more subdued response. Speaking less in specifics and more of embracing \u201ccourageous empathy\u201d and \u201cspiritual dissatisfaction,\u201d Booker raised his voice as he called on the crowd to be agents of change themselves.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment in America where we don\u2019t just celebrate King\u2019s holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recommit ourselves to be the agents of change. To be the daring dreamers once again. To be the laborers in our democracy because that is what we need. Do not be discouraged. Because we know that hope is the act of conviction. That despair will not have the last word.\u201d\n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) not only announced her bid for president on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, she held her first news conference at Howard University, the historically black university in Washington, D.C., that she attended.\n\nHarris signaled her intent to aggressively woo black voters not only by launching her campaign on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and invoking Chisholm, but also by holding her first news conference at Howard, the historically black university where she went to college.\n\nIn a post on Medium explaining why she was running, Harris said she wanted to live in an America \u201cwhere black women aren\u2019t three to four times more likely to die in childbirth than white women. A country where for-profit prison businesses \u2014 a billion-dollar industry \u2014 are a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nBut when Harris \u2015 who has a Jamaican-born father and an Indian-born mother \u2015 was asked at Howard how she identified herself, she gently dodged the question.\n\n\u201cI identify as a proud American,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nBiden, who is still debating whether to run, spent the day in Washington speaking at an event organized by Sharpton. At the breakfast, he said America needs to do more to root out the systemic racism \u201cthat most of us whites don\u2019t like to acknowledge even exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw it in Charlottesville as Klansmen and white supremacists, literally, and neo-Nazis, literally, slunked out of their dark rooms, their digital hideaways, their crazed and vicious faces literally contorted, illuminated by torchlight,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile his work on a heavy-handed crime law in the 1990s has alienated younger black activists, he remains a favorite of many older voters. During his appearance, he apologized for a specific 1986 law that imposed harsher punishments on the mostly black users of crack cocaine than it did on the mostly white users of powdered cocaine.\n\n\u201cIt was a big mistake that was made,\u201d Biden said, according to The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s trapped an entire generation.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, the billionaire Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat, didn\u2019t offer similar regrets for the stop-and-frisk policies he implemented while running New York that were eventually abandoned by his successor and declared unconstitutional. Instead, he pitched the crowd on his record on education and gun control.\n\n\u201cWe disagreed on stop-and-frisk, but we agreed on education,\u201d Sharpton said while introducing Bloomberg.\n\nAt the National Action Network\u2019s headquarters in Harlem on Monday, Gillibrand said the country needed to have \u201can honest conversation about the systemic, institutional and daily individual acts of racism in our country,\u201d citing the racial pay gap and disproportionate number of people of color who die during childbirth or are arrested for marijuana possession as key problems.\n\nThe burden to fix such problems, she argued, should not be left solely to minority communities.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to ask men and women of color to bear the burdens of every single one of these fights over and over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cWhite women like me must share in this burden and commit to using our voices to amplify yours.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-public-lands-ocasio-cortez_us_5c61de18e4b028d54316c422": "Starting in 1933, during the heart of the Great Depression, hundreds of thousands of young, unmarried men went to work for the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of several federal programs created as part of Franklin D.

An early set of guiding principles, it outlines lofty goals of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, building climate-resilient infrastructure and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs.\n\nWhile the document includes few details about how to accomplish these goals, it makes clear that public lands and waters will be key.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this undated file photo, a large fir tree heads to the forest floor after it is cut by an unidentified logger in the Umpqua National Forest near Oakridge, Oregon.\n\nThe non-binding measure requires \u201censuring that public lands, waters, and oceans are protected\u201d and \u201crestoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and fragile ecosystems through locally appropriate and science-based projects that enhance biodiversity and support climate resiliency.\u201d It demands that all U.S. residents are provided with \u201cclean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.\u201d And instead of relying on emerging technologies to suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, it calls for \u201crestoring natural ecosystems through proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage,\u201d including large-scale land preservation and planting new forests in treeless areas.\n\n\u201cThe success of the Green New Deal is intrinsically linked to how well we can protect and restore our public lands and waters,\u201d Markey told HuffPost in an email Monday. \u201cIf we fail, these precious resources will be forever altered. Solutions that include national parks and wild lands will also bring diverse coalitions together and will be critical to the climate mobilization effort.\u201d\n\nIt is yet to be seen what sort of public land policy proposals surface as part of this framework. But conservation groups are applauding the measure\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cThe resolution recognizes that public lands and waters are a cornerstone of any comprehensive strategy for solving the climate crisis,\u201d Kate Kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a former Interior Department official in the Obama administration, said via email. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: we can\u2019t afford to continue to drill away our natural heritage \u2014 and we should protect the land and waters that will help protect us from the impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nApproximately one-quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel extraction on federal lands, according to a federal report released by the Trump administration in November.\n\nWeber said it is time the federal government end its practice of leasing lands for fossil fuel production at below market value, and instead explore boosting renewable energy development that helps protect ecosystems, species and indigenous lands.\n\nJust as public lands can be a major driver of climate change, they can also be a tool for combating it.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images A pumpjack operates above an oil well in the Bakken Formation outside Williston, North Dakota, U.S., on Friday, March 9, 2018\n\nIn a January op-ed in High Country News, Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, urged backers of the Green New Deal to not forget about public lands in their pursuit of climate action. And Jad Daley, president and CEO of conservation organization American Forests, published an op-ed last week in The Hill in which he writes that \u201cmany [Green New Deal] champions are overlooking the huge potential\u201d of forests to reduce planetary-warming emissions and create jobs.\n\n\u201cFor a Green New Deal to be the \u2018real deal,\u2019 it must embrace forests,\u201d Daley wrote.\n\nAt a press conference last week to introduce the resolution, Ocasio-Cortez talked about the importance of environmental protection in fossil fuel-dependent communities like those in Appalachia. But she and Markey did not mention the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through changes in public land management and ecosystem restoration.\n\n\u201cThe resolution is silent on any individual technology which can move us toward a solution on this problem,\u201d Markey said at the press conference. \u201cThis is a resolution that does not have individual prescriptions in it.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s office did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nA 2016 study found that humans wiped out 10 percent of Earth\u2019s wilderness areas over just two decades. And a dire report by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that solving the climate crisis will require removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, in addition to a rapid global effort to scale back fossil fuels. The IPCC examined several pathways to keep the planet\u2019s average temperature from warming 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, considered the aspirational goal of the 2015 Paris climate treaty. All pathways required not only stopping deforestation but increasing Earth\u2019s forested areas. And depending on the scale of emissions reductions, the effort could require adding as many as 3.86 million square miles \u2015 an area slightly larger than the U.S. \u2015 of forest by 2050.\n\n\u201cYou need to have forestry on your side,\u201d Drew Shindell, a climate science professor at Duke University and a co-author of the IPCC report, told HuffPost at the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal is wildly popular among both Republican and Democratic voters, as HuffPost previously reported. Still, Republican lawmakers have been quick to dismiss it as a \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d proposal.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s relentless push for so-called \u201cenergy dominance\u201d includes plans to massively expand offshore oil and gas drilling. And an internal document that surfaced last year suggested the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation\u2019s leading ocean science agency, is planning to gut protections for America\u2019s marine national monuments, opening millions of acres of federal water to commercial fishing.\n\nOcean conservation nonprofit Oceana is among the many groups that celebrated the introduction of the Green New Deal last week. Protecting oceans, as the resolution calls for, is a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d Beth Lowell, the group\u2019s deputy vice president U.S. campaigns, told HuffPost in an email.\n\n\u201cBy rebuilding ocean abundance, we can help the coastal communities and fisheries that rely on healthy oceans for generations to come,\u201d she said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lover-fighter-booker-warren-embody-2020-divide_us_5c620f86e4b071a3b765e3b7": "Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey agree on most of the issues. But they take sharply different approaches to winning over the Democratic primary electorate.\n\nLAWRENCE, Mass. \u2015 As Sen. Elizabeth Warren formally announced her presidential bid on Saturday, the core of her political identity was emblazoned on the lectern in front of her, instructing viewers to text the word \u201cFIGHT\u201d to receive updates on her campaign.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing the Massachusetts Democrat wants voters to know about her, it\u2019s that she\u2019s a fighter. The word \u201cfight\u201d is in the title of both of the books she\u2019s written while in the Senate (A Fighting Chance and This Fight Is Our Fight). In the 40-minute speech she delivered Saturday, she used the word 28 times.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of our lives,\u201d Warren said to the crowd of 3,500 who gathered at a historic mill in freezing temperatures here, after telling a story about immigrant women striking for better pay and working conditions. \u201cThe fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s team and allies believe they\u2019re adopting the combat-ready stance Democratic voters are craving, one focused on fighting and defeating the forces Warren sees as causing rampant economic inequality: Republicans, big banks, corporations and the lobbyists they employ.\n\nAt the same time, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) was delivering a very different pitch in Iowa, trying to convince the early caucus state\u2019s voters to adopt a message aimed at uniting a country fractured along class, racial and gender lines, using a story of a white lawyer who was inspired by the March on Selma to help Booker\u2019s parents outsmart a racist real estate agent. Over the course of two town halls lasting a little over two hours on Saturday, Booker used the word \u201clove\u201d two dozen times.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be one about trash-talking and trolling or demeaning and degrading a fellow American,\u201d he said at one point, addressing a packed town hall in Des Moines. \u201cPatriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.\n\n\u201cLove means that I see you. I see your worth. I see your dignity,\u201d said the senator, whose recent book was titled Unity. \u201cWe may not always agree. There are some days we may not like each other that much, but love says, I see you.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates, both senators from the Northeast who are seen as part of the party\u2019s liberal wing, embody the two poles of a rhetorical debate that will consume the Democratic Party over the course of the next year: Should the party select a candidate who is more focused on repairing the long-existing fractures in American society and culture exacerbated by the presidency of Donald Trump, or one focused on defeating the party\u2019s b\u00eates noires?\n\n\u201cThere are two schisms within the voter base,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa. \u201cThere\u2019s progressives versus the establishment. And there\u2019s \u2018When they go low, we go high\u2019 versus \u2018We want to fight.\u2019\u201d\n\nBagniewski\u2019s use of a phrase famously used by former first lady Michelle Obama at the 2016 Democratic National Convention points to another, frequently unspoken element of the debate. While no candidate would explicitly criticize President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular politician in the Democratic Party, the debate is also a de facto discussion of the former president\u2019s political leadership style.\n\nObama ran, famously, as the \u201cHope and Change\u201d candidate, and entered the White House with a strategy based on seeking bipartisan cooperation on a host of issues. Relentless opposition from GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ruined those plans, and Obama shifted in his second term to a strategy based on more unilateral moves.\n\nTo a certain extent, the rhetorical contrast mirrors an ideological divide. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are likely to be the two highest-profile progressive populists in the field, and both are fond of naming and shaming their opponents \u2015 Sanders essentially convinced Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $15 by relentlessly slamming Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s CEO. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a potential candidate and favorite of labor unions, also is well-practiced in inveighing against the American establishment.\n\nOn the opposite side are Booker, who has bucked his party with his support for charter schools; former Vice President Joe Biden, a moderate who has refused to apologize for his close relationships with Republicans; and center-left figures like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who are both fond of calling for unity.\n\nThere\u2019s progressives versus the establishment. And there\u2019s \u2018when they go low, we go high\u2019 versus \u2019we want to fight. Sean Bagniewski, Polk County Democrats chair\n\n\u201cWe may come from different places,\u201d Klobuchar said amid a snowstorm as she announced her candidacy Sunday in Minneapolis. \u201cWe may pray in different ways. We may look different and love different. But we all live in the same country of shared dreams.\u201d\n\nThe remaining top candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, tend to use a mix of both rhetorical styles.\n\nThe divide can be seen everywhere. At an event honoring Martin Luther King Jr. in South Carolina last month, Booker invoked the civil rights leader\u2019s record of bringing people together \u2015 \u201cKing said we can never let someone pull us so low as to hate them,\u201d Booker noted \u2015 while Sanders portrayed him an insurgent who wanted to bring drastic change to the American political system.\n\n\u201cWe must be faithful to his revolutionary spirit, his call for a \u2018radical revolution of values\u2019 and for his incredible courage in taking on virtually the entire political and economic establishment of his time,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nAnd while Warren\u2019s speech on Saturday blamed growing income inequality directly on the wealthiest Americans \u201cwaging class warfare against hardworking people for decades,\u201d Biden\u2019s desire for inclusion extends even to the nation\u2019s economic elite.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think 500 billionaires are the reason we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said at a Brookings Institution event in 2018. \u201cThe folks at the top aren\u2019t bad guys.\u201d\n\nThere are limits to the split: Warren regularly mentions her red-state upbringing in Oklahoma and isn\u2019t looking to replicate Trump\u2019s divide-and-conquer political tactics, and Booker isn\u2019t promising to roll over for Republicans and special interests. Nonetheless, it\u2019s clear Warren\u2019s supporters think the party has moved past its desire to place political unity over policy victories.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in your face,\u201d Jana Adam, a retired nurse who attended a Warren event in Sioux City, Iowa, said approvingly. \u201cJust trying to get people with hopefulness, it doesn\u2019t work anymore. You need to get down and dirty.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s backers, meanwhile, insist his re-creation of Obama\u2019s rhetoric in 2008 will lead to a repeat of Obama\u2019s successes in both the primary and general elections, pitching him as an antidote to Trump\u2019s constant divisiveness.\n\n\u201cAmericans have reached the point where they\u2019re just so tired of division. Cory Booker, his career, has been built on a really unifying message,\u201d said Jim Demers, a prominent New Hampshire Democrat who was one of Obama\u2019s earliest backers and now supports Booker. \u201cHis message, his style, his tone has always been all about bringing the country together.\u201d\n\nEarly polls of the 2020 field, which place Biden and Sanders as the front-runners, give few hints about which style Democrats might ultimately prefer. But in a CNN poll released earlier this month, 68 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said it was extremely or very important for a candidate to be willing to work with Republicans, while 65 percent said the same of holding progressive positions on the issues, and only 47 percent said it was important for a candidate to bring an outsider perspective to Washington.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/howard-schultz-democrats-2020_us_5c522fa1e4b093663f5afc7f": "WASHINGTON \u2015 An independent presidential bid by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wouldn\u2019t only threaten Democrats by siphoning anti-Trump votes, it could also hurt the party\u2019s messaging on critical issues like health care, taxes and spending.\n\nSchultz, a self-identified \u201clifelong Democrat,\u201d earned a reputation as one of the most progressive corporate leaders with his unwavering support of gay marriage, racial equality and labor-friendly policies during his tenure at the coffee company.\n\nIf he decides to go forward with what he calls a \u201ccentrist independent\u201d bid for president in 2020, Schultz would aid Republicans in their efforts to portray Democrats as extreme and radical by proposing things like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal.\n\nWith a third-party candidate on the ballot who echoes their rhetoric, the GOP would have more room to argue that their ideas are sensible and middle-of-the-road.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Schultz is even considering a candidacy speaks to how far left the Democratic Party has gone,\u201d said Matt Gorman, the former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThe longer he is in the race, the more he highlights that fact. It will cause some uncomfortable questions for Democrats to have to answer on taxes, entitlements and spending.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire former executive called Warren\u2019s proposed tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million \u201cridiculous.\u201d He blasted Harris\u2019 endorsement of a single, government-run insurance program modeled on Medicare as \u201cun-American.\u201d He used similar language to describe Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea of a 70 percent top marginal tax rate on income over $10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so un-American to think that way,\u201d Schultz said at his book tour event in New York City on Monday when asked about an adviser to Ocasio-Cortez describing the existence of billionaires in the country as a \u201cpolicy failure.\u201d\n\nThe rhetorical onslaught of a would-be candidate who hasn\u2019t even officially entered the race has left many Democrats howling, accusing Schultz of embarking on an arrogant campaign with little chance of success other than potentially handing President Donald Trump a second term in office.\n\n\u201cThe reason his [campaign] rollout is going so bad is not just because they\u2019ve failed to execute well, but that the idea has no constituency outside of his personal friends,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats are also irked that Schultz has stomped on their string of victories in Congress in recent months by dominating media coverage this week in multiple appearances on national television, despite November\u2019s 40-seat pickup in the House and Trump\u2019s cave-in on the government shutdown.\n\nBut Republicans are clearly enjoying the show. They\u2019re happy to point to Schultz\u2019s criticisms as yet more evidence that Democrats are wrong about the direction they want to take the country in as the 2020 presidential campaign ramps up.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see no shortage of Democratic freakouts over the next two years. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)\n\n\u201cAny help we get in terms of sending the message that a single government-run health care plan that just raises people\u2019s taxes and takes away the ability to provide Medicare for individuals over the age of 65... I think sending that message is a good one,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo if Mr. Schultz or other members... that are closer to the middle are prepared to say that, that\u2019s probably healthy for the debate.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said he was skeptical about the viability of a Schultz candidacy and whom it may help in the 2020 election. But he, too, said he liked what he heard from the former executive about health care and government spending.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s being realistic. No one really seriously believes we can find $3 trillion a year to pay for everyone\u2019s health care in America,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nSen.

Elizabeth Warren officially announced her presidential bid near the banks of the Merrimack River here on Saturday, picking a highly symbolic location that points to both long, worker-centric political tradition Warren seeks to inherit and the challenge she might face in winning over an increasingly diverse Democratic party.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way,\u201d Warren said at the Everett Mills, where a group of Polish women walked off the job in January 1912, setting off the famous Bread and Roses Strike, when tens of thousands of immigrant workers united to shut down the city\u2019s textile mills for the winter, winning substantial raises and safer work conditions.\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Elizabeth Warren is done exploring. She's running for president.\n\nWarren\u2019s official entry into the race to win the Democratic nod to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 has been expected since she announced the formation of an exploratory committee in late December. She joins a field that already includes three of her fellow Democratic senators \u2015 New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker, California\u2019s Kamala Harris and New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand \u2015 and could soon include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, along with a host of other candidates.\n\nShe launched her campaign with an introduction from Rep. Joe Kennedy III, winning the blessing of the highest-profile member of the first family of Democratic politics, and with the backing of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and fellow Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole,\u201d said Kennedy, a former student of Warren\u2019s at Harvard Law School. \u201cA leader that will bring us together to confront our great threat: A system that protects the powerful and the privileged.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a practical reason to announce in Lawrence \u2015 it\u2019s a quick, 10-minute drive to New Hampshire, which hosts the first-in-the-nation primary \u2015 but the symbolic reasons to choose the former mill town 40 minutes north of Boston instead of a more prominent locale are stronger. The Bread and Roses Strike, which was led in large part by women, immigrants and immigrant women, is a rich historical text for Warren to invoke during a speech announcing her bid. It allows Warren to connect to a landmark moment in labor history, and it also links her directly to one of just a handful of majority-minority cities in her home state, giving her a chance to show her appeal to the voters who may ultimately decide the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about immigrants, it\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about workers\u2019 rights, it\u2019s about pay equity,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s about everything Elizabeth Warren has spent her life fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe Bread and Roses strike began in response to a pay cut of 32 cents a week. The roughly 30,000 people who worked in the mills were crowded into tenement houses, having arrived in Lawrence from more than 50 different nations. Seven of eight people who worked in the mills were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. At the city\u2019s dominant employer \u2015 the American Woolen Company \u2015 half of the employees were women between the ages of 14 and 18. While doctors in Lawrence had a life expectancy of 65, more than one-third of mill workers died before age 25.\n\nThe strike quickly led to clashes with local police, and a state militia was called in. The Industrial Workers of the World organized the strikers, and soon news of the strike was dominating the nation\u2019s newspapers. Wealthy suffragettes, believing their struggle for the right to vote was linked to that of the strikers, began supporting them financially. To draw additional attention to the cause, the mothers of Lawrence sent their children by train to New York City, a so-called \u201cChildren\u2019s Exodus.\u201d The sight of the malnourished children drew more sympathy to the strikers\u2019 cause. In late February, as a second group of children prepared to leave for Philadelphia, police began clubbing them and their parents. The violence drew further condemnation, and soon both the U.S. House and Senate began investigating the conditions in Lawrence.\n\nIn March, owners agreed to a 15 percent raise for the mill workers, to give double pay for overtime and to improve safety conditions in the mills. The eventual agreement ending the strike was read aloud in Arabic, Polish, Armenian and a slew of other languages, reflecting the diversity of the strikers.\n\nJournalist Bruce Watson, in his book on the strike, \u201cBread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream,\u201d wrote that in 1912, \u201cthe great rudder of a stable society, the middle class, had not yet been invented.\u201d But within months of the end of the strike, Warren noted, Massachusetts became the first state in the country with a minimum wage, part of a newly empowered labor movement that would soon win a 40-hour work week and the elimination of child labor.\n\nIn Warren\u2019s telling of American history, the middle class that the strike helped create over the following decades has fallen by the wayside. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident. It wasn\u2019t inevitable,\u201d she said, pointing the finger at power-hungry lobbyists, misguided Republicans and the corrupting influence of corporate money on politics that she said had derailed progress on everything from gun control to climate change. \u201cOver the years, America\u2019s middle class had been deliberately hollowed out.\u201d\n\nTo fix it, Warren argues, involves more than throwing Trump out of office, and requires a more aggressive form of liberal politics. \u201cToday, millions and millions and millions of American families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well-connected,\u201d she said during her 40-minute speech. \u201cCorruption is a cancer on our democracy. And we will get rid of it only with strong medicine \u2015 with real, structural reform.\u201d\n\nBut Lawrence\u2019s story is as much about immigration as it is about labor. \u201cThe city of Lawrence symbolizes what our country stands for. The wave after wave of immigrants who come to this country seeking a better life,\u201d said Juana Matias, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who previously represented Lawrence in the Massachusetts State House. \u201cWarren coming to Lawrence demonstrates the commitment she has to the middle class.\u201d\n\nInstead of the polyglot immigrant community that existed in 1912, Lawrence today is dominated by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and emigres from Puerto Rico. The city, which is nearly three-quarters Latino in a state that is roughly three-quarters white, has struggled. A 2014 story in Boston Magazine labeled it \u201cThe City of the Damned,\u201d documenting a state takeover of the city\u2019s failing public schools, a high crime rate and the corruption investigations plaguing its then-mayor, William Lantigua.\n\nIt has also become a favorite target of Republican attacks. In a 2018 speech in New Hampshire, Trump blamed Lawrence and Boston by name for the deadly opioid epidemic ravaging New England. Chris Sununu, New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor, has used similar rhetoric. Most famously, former Maine Gov. Paul LePage blamed his state\u2019s problems with fentanyl on black and Latino people from Lawrence and nearby Lowell.\n\nMatias said things are improving in the city, with better schools and less crime under new mayor Daniel Rivera, who spoke before Warren. A small number of biotech and other firms have moved into the massive mill buildings along the river, but the city remains one of the poorest in the state.\n\nLawrence\u2019s large Latino population \u2015 Trump signaled it out because of its status as sanctuary city where local police don\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2015 also provides Warren with an opportunity to show her appeal to voters of color. Massachusetts\u2019 limited number of black and Latino voters means Warren still needs to show she can appeal to voters outside her core base of white progressives.\n\nAfter making her way onstage to Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201c9 to 5,\u201d Warren ticked off a host of policy priorities \u2015 from making it easier to join a union to outlawing gerrymandering to criminal justice reform, but repeatedly returned to her core message of rebuilding the middle class, which she emphasized could appeal to voters across the socioeconomic spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe come from different backgrounds, different religions, different languages, different experiences,\u201d she told the crowd of roughly 3,500 people who braved freezing temperatures to attend the rally. \u201cWe feel the urgency of this moment in different ways.

Fifty-six percent wanted the stronger candidate against Trump, even if they disagreed on most issues. Just 33 percent wanted a candidate whom they agreed with, even if that individual would struggle to defeat the president.\n\nThe finding is a shift from the electoral priorities expressed by both Democratic and Republican voters in 2016. But it matches what Democratic operatives across the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have been telling reporters for months.\n\n\u201cIn prior elections, voters from both parties consistently prioritized shared values over electability when selecting a nominee,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u201cIt looks like Democrats may be willing to flip that equation in 2020 because of their desire to defeat Trump. This is something to pay close attention to when primary voters really start tuning in to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: No consensus has developed among Democratic voters or party operatives over what type of candidate is best equipped to defeat Trump.\n\nShould it be a candidate who can win back the white working-class voters who defected to Trump in 2016? Then Democrats might want former Vice President Joe Biden, who is basing his potential candidacy around his appeal to that demographic. A candidate of color, like Texas\u2019 Juli\u00e1n Castro or California Sen. Kamala Harris, might be best equipped to win Republican-controlled Sun Belt states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona. Supporters of Vermont Sen.

For instance, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who both represent big cities on the East Coast, are playing up their rural roots, hoping to show Iowans they can win outside the most progressive parts of the country.\n\nThe consensus within both parties on who is electable and who isn\u2019t was torn apart by the results of the last presidential election, when Trump squeaked by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even as much of the GOP establishment predicted political doom.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) unveiled a landmark resolution cementing the pillars of an unprecedented program to zero out planet-warming emissions and restore the middle-class prosperity of postwar America that the original New Deal helped spur.\n\nJust three months after calls for a Green New Deal electrified a long-stagnant debate on climate policy, the Democratic lawmakers released the six-page document outlining plans to cut global emissions 40 to 60 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and neutralize human-caused greenhouse gases entirely by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday is a big day for workers in Appalachia,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cToday is a good day for children who have been breathing dirty air in the Bronx.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious, if measured, clarion call for action that, if accomplished, would transform the United States into the leader in decarbonizing and clear a path forward for the world to avert catastrophic warming.\n\nThe joint resolution stakes out a \u201cten-year national mobilization\u201d plan to build \u201csmart\u201d grids and rapidly increase the share of American power generated from solar and wind from 10 percent today to as close to 100 percent as possible over the next decade. The plan reframes tired talk of repairing the nation\u2019s crumbling bridges, highways and ports as a crisis in a new era of billion-dollar storms. It gets local, demanding upgrades to \u201call existing U.S. buildings\u201d to \u201cachieve maximum\u201d efficiency with energy and water use.\n\nThat holistic framing extends to the way the document describes emissions, mentioning \u201ccarbon\u201d just once and instead using the term \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d which includes methane, nitrous oxide and ozone.\n\nEnergy and infrastructure issues are the centerpiece of the resolution, with explicit goals of overhauling the transportation sector \u2015 the country\u2019s biggest source of climate pollution \u2015 to expand public transit and high-speed rail and to spur a \u201cclean\u201d manufacturing boom with a particular focus on electric vehicles.\n\nBut, unlike most existing Green New Deal concepts, food and water are focal points. The resolution proposes \u201cbuilding a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food\u201d and \u201cguaranteeing universal access to clean water.\u201d To meet those goals, the document describes \u201cworking collaboratively with farmers and ranchers\u201d to reduce agricultural pollution with \u201csustainable farming and land use practices that increase soil health\u201d and \u201csupporting family farming.\u201d\n\nUnabashedly progressive ideals anchor the resolution. A section outlining guidelines for future Green New Deal bills reads like a laundry list of populist policies, including everything from ramped-up antitrust enforcement \u2015 \u201censuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by\u201d monopolies \u2015 to a vastly expanded social safety net, \u201cproviding all people of the United States high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security, and access to clean water, air and healthy and affordable food, and nature.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution seems designed for broad appeal. The fact that Markey, a liberal stalwart who co-authored the last major climate bill Democrats tried to pass in 2009, is the lead Senate sponsor shows the insurgent Ocasio-Cortez wing is building bridges with the old guard.\n\nReuters Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) was the co-sponsor of the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill Democrats nearly passed a decade ago. Now he's spearheading the resolution effort with Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe resolution itself avoids controversial technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, instead calling for low-tech solutions, such as large-scale preservation and planting new forests to absorb carbon already in the atmosphere. In a news release, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team said carbon capture \u201ctechnology to date has not proven effective.\u201d\n\nThe resolution contains more obvious compromises. In a departure from the initial protests that gave rise to the Green New Deal, the document avoids explicitly calling for ending fossil fuel development. It leaves open the possibility of keeping existing nuclear power plants in place until after the initial 10-year mobilization plan is complete, admitting that \u201cwe are currently unsure if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant that fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution is silent on any individual technology which can move us toward a solution on this problem,\u201d Markey said at the press conference. \u201cThis is a resolution that does not have individual prescriptions in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are open to whatever works,\u201d he added later.\n\nBucking the prevailing bipartisan orthodoxy on climate policy, the resolution makes no mention of pricing carbon. The release stated that the \u201cdoor is not closed for market-based incentives or a diverse array of policy levers to play a role in the Green New Deal, but it would be a small role.\u201d\n\nTo supporters, those candid admissions showed that the document represented a feasible first step toward legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is how green socialists will govern,\u201d said Greg Carlock, the researcher at the think tank Data for Progress, whose Green New Deal blueprint from September resembles the resolution. \u201cIt will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe resolution dropped with poignant timing. During his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump ignored climate change and touted a fossil fuel agenda projected to put the world on course for cataclysmic warming, analysis by researchers at more than a dozen environmental groups projects found. On Wednesday, House Democrats kicked off two hearings on climate change less than two hours before NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2018 the fourth-hottest year ever recorded.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the resolution\u2019s prospects of passing. The GOP controls the Senate, and Republican opposition to the Green New Deal started to crystallize at Wednesday\u2019s hearings.\n\nEven among Democrats, who control the House, support is far from guaranteed. By Thursday morning, the resolution garnered more than 60 House Democrats and at least nine Senate Democrats signed onto the resolution. But in a Politico interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is.\u201d Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace issued statements that tempered their support by calling for explicit fossil fuel phase-outs.\n\nThe sort of Green New Deal the resolution describes poses an existential threat to entrenched, deep-pocketed industries that donate to Democrats. Building a constituency powerful enough to challenge fossil fuel producers, automakers and utilities requires support from the labor movement.\n\nYet the influential building-trade unions are skeptical of any policy that impedes fossil fuel infrastructure, a reliable source of lucrative contract jobs. The resolution aims to ease those worries, \u201censuring that Green New Deal mobilization creates high-quality union jobs that pay prevailing wages, hire local workers, offer training and advancement opportunities and guarantee wage and benefit parity for workers affected by the transition.\u201d\n\nBut that rhetoric isn\u2019t new, and it does little to assuage festering concerns. Renewable energy jobs tend to pay less and use fewer unionized workers than pipeline or coal-train gigs. The problem, too, is the steady erosion of labor laws over the past few decades, diminishing hopes that clean-energy work could easily reach wage parity with fossil fuels under existing statutes. A Green New Deal, in that sense, necessitates changes to labor law almost as dramatic as those governing energy and infrastructure. To that end, the resolution directly calls for \u201cstrengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe potential opposition from building trades hasn\u2019t made the Green New Deal any less popular with Democrats\u2019 swelling pool of 2020 contenders. Nearly every declared and likely candidate \u2015 former Vice President Joe Biden is a notable exception \u2015 has offered an endorsement of the Green New Deal in some form or another.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who threw his support behind the Green New Deal resolution last week, is one potential candidate. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) backed the Green New Deal in December, tying support for its climate goals to a jobs guarantee bill he already introduced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) last month sent a letter to the Republican in charge of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee outlining her support for a Green New Deal. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a likely frontrunner when he declares his candidacy, is considering legislation of his own on a Green New Deal.\n\nOthers are vague. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro all said they support the \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cconcept\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nThe resolution may draw clearer battle lines.\n\n\u201cI expect that we\u2019re going to see a lot of people saying they approve of the spirit, they love the bill, they just question whether it could pass as legislation,\u201d said R.L. Miller, president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a starting point.\u201d\n\nThis is how green socialists will govern. It will be thoughtful, it will be politically pragmatic, it will still be ambitious. Greg Carlock, Data for Progress\n\nThe Green New Deal, originally coined in the mid-2000s as a term connoting a way to bridge the environmental and economic goals, re-emerged last year as Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing Democrats ran on unabashedly progressive visions of curbing climate-changing emissions and eradicating poverty in the same stroke. In November, activists from the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats staged sit-in protests in Democratic leaders\u2019 offices, demanding they make a Green New Deal a policy priority in the newly flipped House.\n\nOcasio-Cortez joined the protests, and soon after unveiled a resolution calling for a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House. Pelosi rejected the plan even as roughly 40 Democrats agreed to support the resolution. Instead, she revived a decade-old select committee on climate change, and put a backbench moderate Democrat in charge of the panel.\n\nBut the demonstrations thrust the Green New Deal into the national spotlight. It proved popular. In December, 81 percent of registered voters said they supported a plan to generate 100 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity from clean sources within the next 10 years, upgrade the U.S. power grid, invest in energy efficiency and renewable technology, and provide training for jobs in the new, green economy, according to a poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University. That included 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans, with an eyebrow-raising 57 percent of conservative Republicans in agreement.\n\nAnother poll published last week found voters narrowly supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThe left is putting its heads together on how we can actually govern, how we can go from an opposition force, a resistance force, to one that can do things of the many, rather than the 1 percent,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst at 350.org. Speaking of the resolution, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in this.\u201d\n\nStephen O\u2019Hanlon, a Sunrise Movement spokesman, downplayed the disparities between the resolution and some of the initial demands his fellow activists made \u2015 namely the lack of an explicit fossil fuel phase-out or a hard 2030 deadline for 100 percent renewables.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bill, which means there\u2019s a lot of details to be worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still feel very good about the pieces that are still being figured out.\u201d\n\nThe resolution includes justice provisions that would be difficult to criticize. It echoes the 2015 Dakota Access pipeline protests that Ocasio-Cortez credits with inspiring her to run for office. In one section, it calls for \u201cobtaining free, prior and informed consent for Indigenous peoples for all decisions that impact them and their traditional territories.\u201d The document opens with a pledge to \u201cpromote justice and equity by stopping current, prevent future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez said at the press conference that her focus was on \u201cfully funding coal miners\u2019 pensions\u201d and \u201ccleaning the water in West Virginia.\u201d\n\nYet the resolution looks beyond the Green New Deal\u2019s impact at home. One provision, as HuffPost reported Tuesday, calls for the United States to \u201cpromoting the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding, and services with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nThat could spark a new debate over how central climate change should be to the progressive foreign policy vision taking shaping ahead of the 2020 election. Though China surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide over a decade ago, Americans boast far larger CO2 footprints per capita and remain the world\u2019s largest historic emitters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have a discussion about the debt we owe to the international community for our reckless treatment of the environment,\u201d said Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress. \u201cIt will be a tough discussion but it shows the way Ocasio-Cortez is changing the discussion.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-money_us_5c59d656e4b00187b5558da0": "Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had the best fundraising quarter of her life in 2018, boosted in part by her decision to support Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.\n\nCollins raised $1.8 million in the last quarter of the year, but just $19,000 of that money came in itemized donations \u2015 contributions of $200 or more \u2015 from residents of Maine.\n\nIn contrast, $32,000 came from public advocates of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, according to a review by the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century. For the most part, these people donated on the same day or after Collins\u2019 Oct. 5 announcement that she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, even though he faced sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nSome of the donations she received:\n\n$2,700 from Alicia Downs on Oct. 5. Downs signed an August 2018 letter of women who worked with Kavanaugh in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House.\n\n$2,700 from Peter Kalis on Oct. 5. Kalis signed a July 2018 letter from Yale students, alumni and faculty backing Kavanaugh.\n\n$5,400 from Laura Cox Kaplan on Nov. 2. Cox Kaplan gave two donations of $2,700 to Collins on the same day. She and her husband, Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s public policy chief, are friends of Kavanaugh. Cox Kaplan sat behind Kavanaugh during his hearing and spoke at an #IStandWithBrett press conference.\n\n$18,450 from 16 other women who signed the Bush White House letter. In addition to Downs, 16 other women who signed the August 2018 letter of women who worked with Kavanaugh in the White House gave to Collins between Oct. 19 and Dec. 31. Their donations ranged from $250 to $2,700.\n\n$2,750 from four women who knew Kavanaugh in high school. Four women \u2015 Julie DeVol, Meghan McCaleb, Ann Fowler and Suzanne Matan \u2015 who signed a Sept. 14 letter from women who knew Kavanaugh in high school also donated to Collins\u2019 campaign between Oct. 19 and Oct. 30, in amounts ranging from $250 to $1,000.\n\n\u201cFor all the talk about Collins\u2019s record-setting quarter, the reality is that she raised more money from Kavanaugh sympathizers than she did from the people she\u2019s supposed to be representing,\u201d said Amelia Penniman, a spokeswoman for Bridge. \u201cThat fact speaks volumes and underscores exactly why her days in the Senate are numbered.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019 office did not return a request for comment. But Amy Abbott, the deputy treasurer of her campaign committee, earlier said that the high amount of out-of-state contributions was deliberate.\n\n\u201cWe made an effort to have a strong quarter because we wanted to send the message that Senator Collins will be prepared to run a vigorous campaign in 2020,\u201d Abbott told the Bangor Daily News, which had reported on the fundraising totals. \u201cWe focused our fundraising efforts nationally, which we typically do until the election year, which is why there were relatively fewer donations from Maine.\u201d\n\nShe added that there were \u201cmany contributions\u201d from Maine voters that were under the $200 reporting threshold. Indeed, there are hundreds of thousands of dollars in unitemized contributions. In theory, they could all be from Mainers and therefore exceed the amount contributed by Kavanaugh supporters. Since the data aren\u2019t public, though, there\u2019s no way of knowing.\n\nDemocrats initially hoped that Collins could be one of the Republicans to join them in tanking Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. She has been a supporter of abortion rights, while President Donald Trump made clear his Supreme Court justice nominees would overturn those protections.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-super-pac-steve-phillips_us_5c5cc0eae4b03afe8d65e675": "\u201cI expect, frankly, there are going to be thousands of people, many of them professionals of color, who are supportive of Cory and want to give him more than $2,700,\u201d he said, referring to the legal limit for federal campaign donations at the time. \u201cAnd we want to give them a vehicle, because we think he represents the best chance to reassemble the Obama coalition and bring back the White House.\u201d\n\nBooker, who has political roots in northern New Jersey, has long-standing ties to donors on Wall Street and in the pharmaceutical industry, but Phillips has said he wants to build a broad donor base instead of relying on a few wealthy individuals.\n\nThe Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is allied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Booker should directly ask Phillips to shut down the super PAC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to make clear for voters that Democrats stand on the side of everyday working people against big-money interests,\u201d PCCC spokeswoman Marissa Barrow said. \u201cCory Booker is in a unique position with a super PAC already existing \u2015 he can send an important signal to voters about the strength of his values by publicly calling on his longtime friends to shut down their big-money Super PAC on his behalf, and either return the checks or donate them to voter registration organizations.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s nothing Booker can do to force Phillips to shut down the group. In 2008, Phillips continued to fund an outside group supporting Obama\u2019s candidacy even after the Obama campaign asked him to stop. And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unsuccessfully tried to stop a super PAC funded by National Nurses United from supporting him in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nPhillips, in a statement, said his group\u2019s work was necessary not just to help Booker to win the primaries but also to lift a Democrat over Trump in the general election.\n\n\u201cCory Booker\u2019s candidacy is the best vehicle for inspiring the kinds of large voter turnout in communities of color that will be necessary for progressives to win up and down the ticket in 2020,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWhomever the Democratic nominee ends up being, she or he is going to need voters of color to win. As our team has done for a decade, Dream United will work with all interested parties to move resources into communities of color to expand the electorate. What we are doing goes beyond Booker. We are doing this for our country.\u201d\n\nNo other super PACs supporting 2020 Democrats have been launched so far, although The New York Times reported in December that allies of Harris and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand have discussed the possibility.\n\nDemocratic operatives watching the 2020 contest have speculated that candidates may decide to set up super PACs in order to better compete in ultraexpensive California, whose primary is taking place earlier in 2020 than in previous cycles.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comments from Marissa Barrow and Steve Phillips.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicaid-michigan-whitmer-verma-gop_us_5c5dcaffe4b0910c63f035db": "Between 61,000 and 183,000 low-income residents of Michigan are likely to lose government-provided health insurance next year, thanks to new Medicaid rules the state Republican legislature passed last summer and that the newly elected Democratic governor now wants those lawmakers to amend.\n\nThe changes apply to people who got Medicaid because of Michigan\u2019s expansion of the program, in 2014, when the state tapped federal dollars available through the Affordable Care Act and opened enrollment to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line. Under new requirements set to take effect in January 2020, those beneficiaries must demonstrate they are working at least 20 hours a week, trying to find work or unable to work.\n\nSupporters, including GOP leaders in the legislature, say the new requirement and reporting regimen will encourage people to find jobs \u2015 and that, more fundamentally, it\u2019s wrong to demand taxpayers subsidize health care for people who could find employment but don\u2019t.\n\nBut most people who got coverage through the Medicaid expansion are either working already or cannot hold jobs, because they are caring for others or have serious conditions of their own, studies have shown repeatedly. And in Arkansas, which imposed work requirements last year, more than 18,000 people lost their coverage for failing to comply.\n\nIf local reporting and available data are indicative, people aren\u2019t generally losing coverage because these people actually failed to meet the work requirement or lack qualifying hardships. Instead, they are losing coverage because they had difficulty navigating the complex reporting requirements.\n\nAdvocates for the poor worry the same thing will soon happen in Michigan, only on an even larger scale, and that it probably won\u2019t stop there.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's newly elected Democratic governor, is urging the GOP state legislature to roll back Medicaid work requirements slated to take effect next year.\n\nThe federal Medicaid law, which dates back to 1965, requires that states seeking major changes get special permission from the federal government. The Obama administration looked askance at work requirements on the theory that they could harm beneficiaries, which would be a clear violation of the Medicaid statute.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a different attitude, approving seven such applications, including Michigan\u2019s, with another eight now pending.\n\nSeema Verma, chief administrator of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been a vocal proponent of the work requirements \u2015 arguing last year that they are \u201cnot some subversive attempt to just kick people off of Medicaid \u2026 their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.\u201d\n\nBut there is scant evidence that work requirements encourage people to find employment. If anything, the evidence suggests the opposite \u2015 that Medicaid coverage makes it easier for people to find and hold on to jobs, most likely because they don\u2019t have to worry about medical problems that would make work difficult.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not clear how much the Trump administration cares about what happens to the people who lose Medicaid \u2015 or whether it cares at all. Among the first states to get the administration\u2019s go-ahead for work requirements, not a single one of them had created systems for checking whether people losing coverage end up in better jobs or with better health, according to an investigation that the Los Angeles Times published this week.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to look at the requirements and not see them as part of a broader, more general assault on government-financed health insurance \u2015 an assault that is still ongoing, all across the country, even though GOP efforts to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d were perhaps the single biggest reason Republicans suffered such a devastating rebuke at the polls in the midterm elections.\n\nMichigan, a state that was pivotal in Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential victory, was actually one of the states where Republicans fared worse. They lost a pair of closely contested congressional races along with the top statewide offices, up to and including governor.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, the state senator who would eventually win that contest, attacked her GOP opponent for supporting repeal of the Affordable Care Act. She also touted her role in getting the Medicaid expansion through the state legislature.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Seema Verma, who oversees Medicaid for the Trump administration, has urged states to impose work requirements on Medicaid \u2014 and approved several applications to do so.\n\nMichigan has been a case study in what the expansion can accomplish. Approximately 680,000 residents now have health insurance through the expansion, and as a result they are more likely to get medical care (like treatment for heart conditions) and less likely to experience financial distress (like running up credit card debts), according to studies by researchers at the University of Michigan.\n\nBut Michigan\u2019s legislature, where gerrymandering has given conservative Republicans extra clout, resisted the expansion for years, even though the former two-term governor, Republican Rick Snyder, was in favor.\n\nWith Snyder on his way out of office last year, because of term limits, and the GOP\u2019s hold on that position in clear jeopardy, the legislature passed (and Snyder eventually signed) legislation creating the work requirements. That legislation included a \u201ctrigger\u201d provision that would have rolled back the expansion altogether if the federal government didn\u2019t give approval, which it did pending confirmation and a few minor modifications from the state.\n\nOn Friday, Whitmer provided the Trump administration with that confirmation, setting the stage for the work requirements to start next January. But in the official letter, Whitmer repeated some of the objections she had made as a candidate \u2015 and cited a new analysis, from the national consulting firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips, projecting that Arkansas-level effects would mean 183,000 people on Medicaid losing their insurance, or more than a quarter of the people who got coverage through the expansion.\n\n\u201cThe effect of these coverage losses on individuals\u2019 health and financial security is sobering to contemplate,\u201d Whitmer wrote. \u201cAs in Arkansas, Michigan\u2019s new law provides no resources for job training, job search, or job supports. There is no reason to expect better job outcomes.\u201d\n\nIt will be up to the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services to put in place the new system for beneficiaries to report their work status. But while Michigan already has a well-developed online portal for public benefits, Robert Gordon, the new state secretary of health and human services, said he too worries about a replay of the Arkansas experience \u2015 with people losing coverage even when they are following the rules when it comes to employment.\n\n\u201cWhether or not they make sense in principle, we know what happens with work requirements,\u201d Gordon told HuffPost. \u201cPeople don\u2019t get information on how to comply, they don\u2019t understand how they are supposed to comply, they try to comply and are not able to, or they comply and government makes a mistake and doesn\u2019t realize it.\u201d\n\nWhitmer campaigned for governor as somebody who could get things done, like \u201cfixing the damn roads,\u201d by citing her history of bipartisan work in the state senate. But GOP lawmakers are already pushing to block or overturn some of her early moves, including a rollback of Snyder-era changes that give business groups more sway over environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cAlthough the governor says she is committed to partnering with the legislature, she first makes us aware of her intent to water down Michigan\u2019s thoughtful Medicaid work requirements via a press release,\u201d Mike Shirkey, Republican leader in the state Senate, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI will be an active listener and participant in discussions with my governor, but I wholeheartedly believe the work requirement is necessary for Healthy Michigan to continue to function,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans believe, rightly or wrongly, that work requirements are popular. Whether they reconsider the Medicaid changes could depend in part on whether they face political pressure \u2015 say, from from advocates for the poor or the health care industry, and the governor as well.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiffany-trump-state-of-the-union-democrats_us_5c5aafffe4b0871047590120": "Tiffany Trump donned a white outfit for her father President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday, and sent Twitter into overdrive as people speculated over the significance.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe conjecture came because female Democratic lawmakers also pre-arranged wearing white to send the message that they \u201care fighting for the economic security of women & families,\u201d as Rep.

Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), said she was \u201cnot happy, obviously,\u201d she praised Pelosi\u2019s support for hearings on the legislation.\n\nWhen Pelosi dismissively called the Green New Deal \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it\u201d \u2014 \u201cnobody knows what it is,\u201d Pelosi added \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez once again avoided criticizing Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think it is a dream,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Progressives are showing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deference, even as she has lobbed slights at their causes.\n\nOther progressives have shown Pelosi similar deference, despite the obvious mocking tone she used to describe the resolution.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I haven\u2019t seen what she said. And honestly, I don\u2019t really care,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said Thursday, \u201cbecause I know Nancy Pelosi, I know her commitment to doing something big on climate, and I know her record.\u201d\n\nPelosi seems to have avoided the sort of criticism conservatives would dish out to a Republican speaker if they felt dissed because progressives generally believe Pelosi is on their side. The speaker did clean up her comments a bit about the Green New Deal during her weekly press conference Thursday, though she also managed a certain backhanded condescension in doing so, saying she welcomed the \u201centhusiasm\u201d of the Green New Deal as well as \u201cthe other proposals that are out there.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, progressives have gone out of their way to stay aligned with Pelosi. After the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis didn\u2019t get the subpoena power progressives wanted, most liberals stayed quiet about it. When Ocasio-Cortez was asked why she didn\u2019t join the committee on Thursday after Pelosi invited her to be on it, the New York lawmaker said it was because she was busy with her other committees \u2015 and she didn\u2019t mention the lack of subpoena power.\n\nProgressives have also stayed in line on a number of other potential flashpoints. When Democratic leadership decided not to censure Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) \u2015 instead offering a resolution so watered down that King himself voted for it \u2015 hardly anyone spoke up. (One of the only members who did speak out was the only member who voted against the resolution, longtime Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, who authored an actual censure resolution against King.)\n\nAt the beginning of the Congress, all but three Democrats \u2015 Ocasio-Cortez, Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) \u2015 voted for a rules package that included pay-as-you-go provisions that progressives thought were harmful to the Medicare for All cause. And Democrats have stayed in line thus far on efforts to impeach President Donald Trump or even to just acquire his tax returns.\n\nBut Pelosi owes much of her power to progressives. They never made an issue out of the California Democrat\u2019s history of taking corporate PAC donations, and Pelosi quickly locked up their support during the speaker\u2019s race, even though high-profile Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez had initially wavered on Pelosi. With the more liberal wing behind her, Pelosi was able to define her opposition as a group of white, moderate men, which in turn put pressure on those Democrats to get behind her.\n\nObviously, the ability to frame issues so shrewdly is part of Pelosi\u2019s power. But she often has such a strong hand because Democrats stick together. During the shutdown, there were hardly any Democrats demanding that Pelosi move away from her original demand that there be no money for a border wall. Again, progressives were key in making that the default Democratic position, though Pelosi also won because she was able to keep every other Democrat in line as well.\n\nBut at what point do progressives start taking Pelosi\u2019s shots personally? When do her efforts to protect vulnerable Democrats from a truly liberal agenda become a problem? And when are progressives going to demand more from their leadership than some placating hearings or a toothless select committee?\n\nWhat we all want is to get something done. And I think we want to move the ball forward. We don\u2019t just want to do press conferences. I mean, we want to achieve things. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.)\n\nFor now, progressives look interested in playing the long game, knowing that none of the bills they really want to pass will become law with Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate. Progressives seem to have taken the view that even voting on their dream legislation would do more to divide Democrats than to advance their cause.\n\nJayapal, the lead author of the Medicare for All bill, told HuffPost on Wednesday that she does have commitments to get hearings on her measure, starting with the Rules Committee under the control of longtime liberal champion Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and then moving to the Budget Committee. She hopes to eventually get hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as in Ways and Means, but she hasn\u2019t asked for a vote.\n\nYou could say the same about the Green New Deal. While Democratic lawmakers made a big show of their Green New Deal rollout on Thursday, the legislation at this point is just a nonbinding resolution with principles for future legislation. It\u2019s a plan to come up with a plan \u2015 and it may never get a vote either.\n\nBut progressives aren\u2019t complaining. They\u2019re not slamming Pelosi, and they\u2019re trying to focus on where there is consensus, like on shoring up Obamacare, lowering drug prices and building initial support for their environmental legislation.\n\nAnd while Pelosi may take an occasional shot or let them down legislatively, they\u2019re not airing their grievances publicly \u2015 at least not yet. (Asked for a comment about this story, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, offered: \u201cWe agree with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez that the caucus will not be \u2018divided by whatever narrative.\u2019\u201d)\n\nLeadership is also looking to stay on the good side of the progressives, despite the occasional slip of the tongue from Pelosi.\n\n\u201cWhat we all want is to get something done,\u201d McGovern told HuffPost on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think we want to move the ball forward. We don\u2019t just want to do press conferences. I mean, we want to achieve things.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-democrats-justin-fairfax-sexual-assault-allegation_us_5c59eec1e4b00187b555c4b2": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2015 Virginia has had one of the craziest weeks in state politics. First, the Democratic governor had to explain why there was a photo of two person, one dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb and the other in blackface, on his medical school yearbook page. Now the lieutenant governor is trying to get rid of an allegation that he sexually assaulted a woman in 2004.\n\nDemocrats in the state quickly condemned Gov. Ralph Northam for the racist image from 1984. The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, in particular, was a catalyst in the state party\u2019s abandonment of the governor.\n\nBut so far, Democratic members of the state legislature, known as the General Assembly, have been far more reluctant to discuss the allegation against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait to see how that information evolves,\u201d said Virginia state Sen. Louise Lucas, a black senior Democrat who spoke to reporters in the Capitol rotunda in Richmond on Tuesday to reiterate her calls for Northam to resign.\n\n\u201cI have lots of thoughts \u2015 but not for you,\u201d said state Del. Chris Hurst (D), before abruptly walking through a side door off the House of Delegates floor.\n\nState Sen. Chap Petersen, vice chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus, declined to comment on the matter altogether.\n\nThe Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, a bloc of African-American state delegates and senators, issued a statement on Monday \u2015 but it was just to say that it didn\u2019t have anything to say about the allegation against Fairfax, who is Virginia\u2019s second-ever statewide black elected official.\n\n\u201cThe Virginia Legislative Black Caucus takes all allegations of sexual assault or misconduct with the utmost seriousness,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cGiven the recent allegations regarding Lieutenant Gov. Justin Fairfax, the VLBC will continue to assess this developing situation as more details become available.\u201d\n\nAsked about the matter on the state House floor, Dels. Lamont Bagby and Jeff Bourne, both Democrats, deferred to their caucus\u2019s statement, declining to provide additional comment.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Virginia issued a remarkably similar statement about the allegation on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY OF VIRGINIA STATEMENT: \"All allegations of sexual assault deserve to be taken with profound gravity. We will continue to evaluate the situation regarding Lieutenant Governor Fairfax.\" pic.twitter.com/ae39YSXi69 \u2014 Virginia Democrats (@vademocrats) February 5, 2019\n\nLater in the day, the House and Senate Democratic caucuses released a joint statement with a comparable message.\n\n\u201cThe facts here are still being determined,\u201d the caucuses said. \u201cEvery individual deserves the opportunity to be heard, and we respect anyone who comes forward to share their story.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the claim against Fairfax has indeed complicated the way lawmakers and media outlets discuss the allegation.\n\nOn Sunday night, a far-right website, Big League Politics, published a screenshot of a social media post in which the accuser lamented that Fairfax, who she said had assaulted her, was now poised to ascend to the highest post in the state. It is not clear that the accuser wanted the post to be publicized.\n\nFairfax\u2019s staff subsequently denied the accusation, arguing that The Washington Post had already been alerted to the claim but found \u201csignificant red flags and inconsistencies\u201d in the accuser\u2019s story. His team threatened to take legal action \u201cagainst those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation.\u201d\n\nThe Post responded by publishing its own version of events in which it acknowledged that it had looked into the claim in November 2017 and revealed that the accuser alleged that Fairfax had physically coerced her into performing oral sex in 2004. The newspaper declined to publish the story because it felt it could not corroborate the charge, but it also denied finding \u201cred flags.\u201d\n\nFairfax\u2019s accuser has now hired the same law firm that represented Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nState Democrats are waiting for Fairfax\u2019s accuser to speak publicly about the incident, according to a Democratic activist familiar with their thinking.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) gave a similar explanation for his reticence in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. \u201cEvery person who has a claim that they have been sexually assaulted deserves to tell their own story in their time and that\u2019s not yet happened,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) offered a more laconic comment, referring HuffPost back to Fairfax\u2019s public denial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make no further comment than referring you back to the lieutenant governor\u2019s statement,\u201d Warner tells me when asked about the sexual harassment allegation against Fairfax \u2014 Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) February 5, 2019\n\nBut the Fairfax accusation comes mere months after national Democrats demanded a Senate hearing for Blasey Ford, the accuser of then-Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh.\n\nTo be sure, Blasey Ford had already agreed to reveal her identity when Democrats called for her to testify. It is not yet clear if Fairfax\u2019s accuser wants to do the same, even though Big League Politics chose to publish her name.\n\nBusy with bills and focused on matters at hand right now. Eileen Filler-Corn, Virginia's House Democratic leader, when asked about the Justin Fairfax allegation\n\nStill, it is notable that so far there is no push by Virginia Democrats to provide a forum for Fairfax\u2019s accuser or to encourage her to come forward in the interest of shedding light on the matter.\n\nState Sen. John Edwards (D) flatly rejected offering Fairfax\u2019s accuser a forum, arguing that the allegation was less credible than the one against Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cWe believe [Fairfax],\u201d he said. \u201cThe Washington Post indicated they can\u2019t corroborate anything from [his accuser].\u201d\n\nDel. Karrie Delaney (D) did not reply to a question about whether Fairfax\u2019s accuser deserved a hearing in the General Assembly.\n\nWhen asked about providing an opportunity for the accuser to testify, Del. Hala Ayala (D) appeared to remember something she urgently needed to attend to and walked away.\n\nMany lawmakers cited their focus on the flood of bills they had to vote on before the end of Tuesday, which is crossover day. Each chamber of the state legislature has until the end of the work day to finish passing its own bills for the session; tomorrow they must start looking at the other chamber\u2019s bills.\n\nAsked for her reaction to the allegation against Fairfax, House Democratic Leader Eileen Filler-Corn (D) said, \u201cBusy with bills and focused on matters at hand right now.\u201d She then briskly walked away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so busy with session crossover that we really don\u2019t have time\u201d to react to the Fairfax allegation, said Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler (D), who was unaware that the lieutenant governor\u2019s accuser had hired an attorney.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got so many bills ahead of us now,\u201d said Delaney. \u201cThe people have sent us here to deliver results so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers professed ignorance about the matter.\n\nHad Del. Vivian Watts (D) had a moment to read up on the Fairfax allegation?\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read anything!\u201d Watts replied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Del. Mark Levine (D), when asked for his opinion.\n\nAsked how the situation differed from the allegation against Kavanaugh, Levine again said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d before exiting the House floor through a side door.\n\nAnother reporter asked Delaney what kind of message it sent for Democrats to press for transparency in the Kavanaugh case, but remain relatively silent about Fairfax. Delaney did not respond. But Levine, having returned to the floor, interjected, \u201cIt sends a message that we\u2019re working hard!\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/former-dnc-ceo-race-diversity-2020-candidates_us_5c5b4c2ce4b00187b557df5b": "Leah Daughtry is optimistic.

Kirsten Gillibrand said sorry for her previous immigration stances (they \u201ccertainly weren\u2019t empathetic,\u201d she conceded), Sen. Kamala Harris has been sheepish about her hawkish prosecutorial remarks in deriding \u201cschools not prisons\u201d campaigns, and Sen.

Even if Democrats manage to claw back to power in the Senate and recapture the White House in 2020, the GOP would likely prevent them from advancing to a final vote by using the filibuster.\n\nThat\u2019s why some on the left are pushing Democrats to either be honest with voters about the chances of passing major legislation they\u2019ve introduced or simply rip the Band-Aid off and ditch a rule that doesn\u2019t actually appear in the Constitution anyway.\n\n\u201cThe Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. [Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell] will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything. If Dems win the WH & Senate in 2020, they should nuke the 60-vote threshold on day one and get on with it,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for ex-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said last month.\n\nOther progressives like Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice have argued that Democrats stand to benefit more from eliminating the filibuster because Republicans are generally less likely to propose sweeping changes in domestic policy due to their conservative ideology.\n\nBut nearly a dozen Democrats rejected those arguments in interviews on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, calling the filibuster a critical tool that helps foster bipartisanship, as well as a means of guarding against political passions that can bubble up in the House and the executive branch. Many of those Democratic senators also expressed concern about a scenario in which Republicans once again controlled both Congress and the White House.\n\nIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)\n\n\u201cIf last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive to the nation. So while I understand the frustration ... I think the consequences of getting rid of it are too great,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday.\n\nIndeed, if the filibuster had not been on the books during the first two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans could have passed a whole host of legislation Democrats most likely would not liked to have seen become law \u2015 including, possibly, funding for his border wall.\n\n\u201cWhat you might think today would be in your favor, might not be in your favor tomorrow,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who was just elected to a six-year term, added on Tuesday.\n\nSome Democrats still harbor regrets over the decision in 2013 to unilaterally end the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. Democratic leaders said at the time they were forced to take the step to confirm a number of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees given unprecedented GOP obstruction from people like McConnell. Reid, who pulled the trigger on the rule change, still maintains that it was the right thing to do. But now that Republicans are confirming young, conservative judicial nominees at a historic pace under the Trump administration, some Democrats say there is reason for caution about going even further.\n\n\u201cI would remind people there was a lot of interest in getting rid of the filibuster for judges and for the Supreme Court, and that has not served us well,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked whether she supported eliminating the filibuster on legislation.\n\nMany 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls also share concerns about going nuclear to kill the filibuster. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the most recent entry in the field, said last week he would \u201cpersonally resist efforts to get rid of it.\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said last month she would consider ending the filibuster. In the meantime, the presidential candidate said that lacking 60 votes \u201cmeans you haven\u2019t done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a potential White House contender, has endorsed several progressive proposals on health care and climate change. He has also recently introduced legislation that would drastically expand the estate tax on the wealthy, a proposal he says would would raise $2.2 trillion. But the senator declined to address how to go about getting such proposals passed into law on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit speculative. I need to worry about what\u2019s happening in the country right now. That\u2019s a little bit into the future,\u201d Sanders said when asked whether he supported killing the filibuster.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, was the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who did not rule out the prospect of going nuclear in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cEverything stays on the table. You keep it all on the table. Don\u2019t take anything off the table,\u201d Warren said in an interview with Politico last week.\n\nThe debate over the filibuster is likely to heat up in the Democratic primary over the next two years with many progressives in the race floating a wish list of progressive proposals on everything from health care and taxes, to voting rights and climate change. But some Democrats think the conversation isn\u2019t exactly productive for the party when it comes to running Washington.\n\n\u201cSome of us have to think about governing. ... In terms of nuts and bolts, in terms of making this place work better, I don\u2019t think that talk is helpful,\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting he was not running for president.\n\nThe likelihood of ending the 60-vote threshold on legislation is extremely small in the near future due to bipartisan opposition. Trump repeatedly pushed McConnell to kill the filibuster last year in order to build the wall, for example. The Kentucky senator has resisted the president\u2019s entreaties, estimating in an interview last year that two-thirds of his caucus oppose doing so.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster, which has been around for a long time, is a problem. And it does, I think, generate on many occasions kind of a bipartisan solution, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always bad for the country,\u201d McConnell said in the interview.\n\nStill, progressives don\u2019t view the threat of a filibuster as an impediment to proceeding with legislation like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In fact, they argue that building political support for big new ideas often takes time, and the traditional place where that has occurred in the past is in the lower chamber.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-fairfax-impeachment_us_5c5eb8dde4b0f9e1b17d851b": "Virginia state lawmaker Patrick Hope (D) is issuing an ultimatum to Lt.

The 35-year-old lost his refund both because Republicans targeted wealthy (and heavily Democratic) metropolitan areas for tax hikes and also because of how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration implemented the law.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut rates for taxpayers at every income level and simplified the tax code for most filers. Part of that simplification meant getting rid of a lot of deductions, which people use to reduce the amount of their taxable earnings.\n\nOne of the most controversial changes limited the amount of state and local tax payments that could be deducted. Previously, a tax filer could reduce their federal taxable income by subtracting the income taxes they paid to their state and local governments. The law capped such deductions at $10,000. Williams said he usually pays more than three times that amount in state and local levies.\n\nWhile preparing to file his taxes through the H&R Block website this week, Williams said the blood drained from his face when he realized how much he would owe. He had anticipated getting another refund that he would put toward a vacation.\n\n\u201cI guess that my assumption was that the IRS withholding tables would have been updated to some degree or my company would have done something,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is probably no way Williams could have avoided paying higher taxes, given his circumstances. But if the government had administered the tax law more carefully, he could have been spared the February surprise. Employers are supposed to withhold federal income tax from their workers\u2019 paychecks, and the vast majority of taxpayers typically withhold more than necessary, resulting in a refund in the early part of the year. The average refund is worth nearly $3,000.\n\nBut Republicans rushed their tax cuts through Congress at the end of 2017, making huge changes to the tax code without so much as a hearing, and gave the IRS hardly any time to implement the law, which took effect less than two weeks after Trump signed it.\n\nThe IRS had to scramble to figure how it should change the way tax would be withheld from paychecks for 2018. Officials with the Treasury Department told the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, that they felt they had to work with the same basic W-4 forms that employers were already using to determine withholding amounts. A trade group for payroll providers told the GAO that substantially different forms would necessitate changes to withholding software that would have taken at least half a year.\n\nThe IRS knew from its simulations \u2015 which assumed that people would not adjust their withholding amounts \u2015 that just plugging new numbers into its old withholding tables would probably reduce the number of tax filers getting a refund from 76 percent to 73 percent, according to the July GAO report. The number that owed money would increase by a proportional amount.\n\nThat means millions more households getting a bill from the IRS. In Treasury\u2019s simulations, households that itemized deductions, such as New Yorkers with higher local taxes, were likelier to withhold less tax as a percentage of their total liability.\n\n\u201cThat is the group that ends up paying more tax under the new law,\u201d said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. \u201cIt\u2019s the people in New York who are losing such a large amount of the [state and local tax] deduction they can end up owing more tax because their taxable income goes up by so much.\u201d\n\nTax filing season opened at the end of January, and the government shutdown may have hampered the IRS\u2019 ability to process returns as quickly as in previous years. Around this time in 2018, the IRS said it had processed 30 million returns and dished out 13 million refunds. (The total for the year was 150 million returns and 111 million refunds.) Similar data is not yet available for this year.\n\nThe new law cut taxes for 80 percent of households, with the biggest benefit accruing to the wealthier ones, according to the Tax Policy Center, while roughly 5 percent saw a tax increase. The changes should have been evident in paychecks last year, though incorrect withholding may have obscured the policy until now.\n\nRepublicans knew in advance that the households negatively affected by their tax changes just so happen to be clustered in states where people tend to vote for Democrats. And according to the GAO, the Trump administration may have been more worried about people withholding too much instead of too little, even though the latter can stick people with surprise tax bills and penalties, and reduces overall compliance. Withholding too little, on the other hand, makes people\u2019s paychecks bigger immediately \u2015 and the Trump administration wanted to make sure to help the people it intended to help.\n\n\u201cTreasury officials stated that withholding more from paychecks than in past years for taxpayers whose tax liability is expected to decrease would be inconsistent with the intent of the law as they understood it,\u201d the GAO said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruben-kihuen-harassment-congress-me-too_us_5c5214d6e4b04f8645c754af": "Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images Rep. Ruben Kihuen was reprimanded after a congressional investigation found harassment allegations against him to be credible. But it was one of his accusers who ended up leaving politics.\n\nIn theory, there should have been some justice for Samantha Register.\n\nIn December 2017, Register claimed to BuzzFeed that a freshman congressman, Democrat Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, had sexually harassed her while she served as finance director for his 2016 campaign. The story appeared as dozens of sexual harassment allegations were cascading through statehouses and the wider political world, and the Democratic establishment unreservedly took her side. There were immediate calls for Kihuen to resign. Later, a congressional ethics investigation determined that Register\u2019s story was credible \u2014 and not an isolated case. Kihuen didn\u2019t run for a second term in Congress and has since receded from national politics.\n\nBut then again, so has Register.\n\n\u201cI gave up on finding a full-time job after a while,\u201d she told HuffPost. She quit Kihuen\u2019s campaign in April 2016 over his alleged harassment, and, realizing how vulnerable workers are on the campaign trail, quit politics. For a year she tried without much success to transition to a career in nonprofits. She took a steep pay cut; she paid an onerous fine for breaking her lease in Las Vegas. Finally, she decided to go to graduate school.\n\nRegister\u2019s disenchantment with the systems she encountered shows how the political world is still struggling to enact sufficient protections for people who make harassment complaints. And it exposes the reality that politics is a messy agglomeration of staffers, contractors and party officials who are co-workers in practice but officially lack common supervisors.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is going to happen here?\u201d\n\nRegister had joined Kihuen\u2019s campaign as director of finance in December 2015. Over her repeated objections, she claimed, Kihuen propositioned her for dates and sex and touched her legs. In April 2016, she quit.\n\nAt the time, Kihuen was neither a sitting member of Congress nor even the Democratic nominee; he was simply a candidate for the Democratic nomination. That left Register unsure about who had oversight of Kihuen\u2019s conduct. In reality, no one did, but Register contacted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the national body charged with electing Democrats to the House.\n\nThe midlevel DCCC staffer Register dealt with didn\u2019t believe she wanted him to escalate her complaint, according to text messages they later exchanged, or that the DCCC had a mechanism for doing so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our purview,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhen she chided him months later for not sending her complaint up the chain, he barked that she couldn\u2019t expect the group to do much of anything about such complaints.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is going to happen here?\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re not an employee. We\u2019re not supervisors of campaigns. And we\u2019re not the police.\u201d (By this time, he was no longer a DCCC staffer.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still having trouble understanding what even the point of that was.\u201d\n\nMore than a year later, Register spoke with BuzzFeed. The House Ethics Committee launched an ethics investigation.\n\nThe nine-month investigation had more procedures than the DCCC did, but felt no more humane. The committee strongly encouraged her to hire an attorney, whose fees added up to $5,000. In the hearing in which she was called to testify, without warning her, members of Congress discussed private messages between Register and her husband that she had turned over as evidence.\n\nRegister understood the committee was striving to be dispassionate and fair, but she struggled to see the ultimate benefit. The committee released its findings late last year without first notifying her \u2014 she found out over Thanksgiving when reporters began to contact her \u2014 and issued Kihuen a reproval, its least serious form of reprimand; it doesn\u2019t carry any material punishment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still having trouble understanding what even the point of that was,\u201d she said. She decided that if another person asked her whether to testify before the same committee, she would tell them they didn\u2019t have to if they didn\u2019t want to.\n\nRegister has yet to be approached privately by many of the people offering public plaudits for her bravery. \u201cPeople in the party haven\u2019t reached out to me to say, I\u2019m sorry this happened, can you tell us what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge campaigns to take harassment allegations extremely seriously.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the DCCC updated its internal policy and procedure for sexual harassment and now requires its own staff to become familiar with the policy via an online course. It offers campaigns examples of sexual harassment policies and employee handbooks and requires the campaigns it works with directly to put a sexual harassment policy in writing. The candidates in those campaigns and their staffers must also undergo the online training.\n\n\u201cWhen complaints come to our attention,\u201d a DCCC spokesman said, \u201cwe strongly urge campaigns to take any harassment allegations or other employee concerns extremely seriously and take immediate and effective action to ensure a safe and professional workplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnequivocally,\u201d he added, \u201cstaff is trained and instructed to pass abuse reports up the chain.\u201d\n\nBut just as in 2016, campaigns remain largely autonomous, with no one exercising the final authority that a human resources department would have. Short of filing a lawsuit, or working for the rare campaign with an HR department, a person harassed during a political race has no ultimate arbiter for their complaints.\n\nThe spirit of the response to a person like Register is just as important as the procedures, said Alexis Ronickher, an employment and whistleblower attorney with the Washington law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s more faith in the internal mechanisms of the party caucuses or the party campaign arms, that a staffer could go to them and say, \u2018This is happening to me,\u2019 and there would be action, that would make a difference,\u201d she said.\n\nA system that feels set up for the sake of having a system and lacks buy-in from the organization around it is not enough to truly prevent and address problems, she continued. \u201cThey should want to do it just as a politically smart move, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s not buffoon our way into another scandal.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis November, the House Ethics Committee, having interviewed a dozen witnesses and read thousands of pages of texts and emails, determined that Kihuen \u201cmade persistent and unwanted advances towards women\u201d \u2014 three of them \u2014 \u201cwho were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities.\u201d One woman, a political consultant, testified that Kihuen hit on her and suggested he could help her career if she reciprocated. A Nevada lobbyist testified he slid his hand under her dress and implied they should make a sex tape. (Kihuen, who did not respond to a request for comment, has said he didn\u2019t agree with aspects of the report but extended his \u201csincere apologies.\u201d)", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-jr-gop-never-racist-tweet-gets-massive-pushback_us_5c562dc1e4b09293b204b49a": "Lucas Jackson / Reuters Donald Trump Jr. on the hunt in 2017 with white supremacist defender Rep.

Even though we essentially have everyone in the world at our fingertips, we inevitably fall back into our in-groups. HuffPost can reveal that \u2015 shock, horror \u2015 the people we rely on to weigh evidence and make decisions on behalf of the American people are not immune to this.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s dive into the followers of the potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, we decided to turn things around and look at the interests of the politicians themselves: We\u2019ve compiled an enormous data set that shows who people in both chambers of Congress are following on Twitter. The results point to a significant partisan divide and give a glimpse into the wildly different places where Democrats and Republicans get their information.\n\nThe Nerdy Bit: Methodology\n\nTo put this together, we attempted to compile as complete a list of congressional Twitter accounts as possible \u2015 which was harder than you might think, as there is no central list. When a member of Congress had multiple accounts \u2015 for example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has @ewarren and @SenWarren for her campaign and her congressional office, respectively \u2015 we lumped together the follows rather than try to arbitrate which was the \u201creal\u201d account. So, in this example, if @ewarren follows a given account but @SenWarren doesn\u2019t, that still counts as a follow. For the purposes of keeping count, we\u2019ve decided to count independent Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Angus King (Maine) as Democrats because that\u2019s who they caucus with.\n\nThese numbers are inevitably not going to be 100 percent accurate: There could be accounts we missed or other errors \u2015 not to mention the simple fact that politicians follow and unfollow accounts all the time. But we believe our data is good enough to draw the following interesting conclusions, even given those caveats.\n\nTo keep things clear, we stuck to using data from the House only in the tables below \u2015 but on the bar charts toward the end you\u2019ll see we also collected Senate data. You can use the widget at the bottom to explore data from both chambers.\n\nA Congress Divided\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s take a look at the Twitter accounts most likely to be followed by House Republicans. The most followed accounts are directly related to their work, with the GOP leadership and recently departed Speaker Paul Ryan at the top of the table. According to our data, not everyone in the House follows President Donald Trump.\n\nFox News is ranked pretty high, as are insider news outlets Politico and The Hill. Perhaps most revealing here is the appearance of The Heritage Foundation, an all-powerful right-wing think tank.\n\nMost Followed Twitter Accounts By House Republicans Rank Screen Name R - House D - House 1 HouseGOP 169 28 2 GOPLeader 167 39 3 SpeakerRyan 162 58 4 realDonaldTrump 155 59 5 FoxNews 149 55 6 Heritage 147 10 7 politico 145 172 8 thehill 142 164 9 cathymcmorris 139 22 10 SteveScalise 139 26\n\nThe blue team is similarly obedient to its leaders, with Democrats following their leadership and their most recent president. The appearance of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is interesting: He\u2019s not in leadership, but he\u2019s chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, where much of the Russia investigation action takes place.\n\nMost Followed Twitter Accounts By House Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 BarackObama 184 32 2 HouseDemocrats 182 20 3 nytimes 172 105 4 politico 172 145 5 NancyPelosi 171 35 6 washingtonpost 170 129 7 AP 167 129 8 WhipHoyer 165 27 9 thehill 164 142 10 RepAdamSchiff 157 19\n\nThe divide also extends to the media.

The Democratic top-10 list also features Chuck Todd of MSNBC, Jake Tapper of CNN and Mike Allen of Politico. What is really striking is the disparity in numbers for some other journalists, like Ezra Klein and Nate Silver, whom some detractors might characterize as \u201cliberal.\u201d For example, as you can see in the table below, 119 Democrats \u2015 but only 37 (out of 199) Republicans \u2015 follow Silver of FiveThirtyEight. It\u2019s also interesting to note that despite Fox being\u2026 well, Fox, Chad Pergram is still clearly someone whom Democrats in the House are interested in hearing from.\n\nMost Followed Journalists By House Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 maddow 151 16 2 chucktodd 146 90 3 jaketapper 138 96 4 ezraklein 136 33 5 chrislhayes 129 20 6 mikeallen 122 101 7 NateSilver538 119 37 8 daveweigel 114 48 9 ChadPergram 113 132 10 mitchellreports 113 43\n\nThis, however, is just scratching the surface.\n\nFollow The Leader\n\nWe decided to see if the data could tell us anything about the 2020 Democratic primary. Perhaps Twitter follows by people in Congress could be a useful proxy for establishment support \u2015 in which case, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is narrowly leading the pack of potential presidential candidates, closely followed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren. (Note that some people are listed twice, as they have multiple Twitter accounts.)\n\nMost Followed 2020 Democrats Rank Screen Name D - House R - House 1 CoryBooker 138 13 2 SenWarren 137 9 3 SenGillibrand 136 19 4 JoeBiden 133 5 5 SenSanders 119 14 6 KamalaHarris 112 5 7 ewarren 91 5 8 BetoORourke 74 4 9 BernieSanders 70 6 10 SherrodBrown 11 2 11 gillibrandny 3 0\n\nIt\u2019s also fun to look at other individual accounts to see the breakdown of congressional followers. For example, here are the results for Katy Perry, who was one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most high-profile supporters in 2016 \u2015 she\u2019s followed by 22 House Democrats and one Republican:\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nTaylor Swift has more bipartisan appeal, and is followed by eight House Democrats and seven House Republicans:\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nThe ghost of culture wars past are still reflected on Twitter. Here\u2019s the follower breakdown for Chick-fil-A, which became a cause celebre for Republicans in 2012 after a top executive commented publicly on his opposition to same-sex marriage. (Sadly, no one in Congress appears to follow Gillette, so we couldn\u2019t surmise anything about its ongoing \u201ccontroversy.\u201d)\n\nHuffPost/James O'Malley\n\nAnd now the best part. As we did last week, we\u2019ve built a widget so you can go through the data yourself.

She is among more than a dozen Democratic senators who in, in late 2017, co-sponsored Medicare for All legislation from Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and longtime champion of the idea.\n\nHarris reiterated that support just a few weeks ago, in an op-ed for The New York Times.\n\nBut the Medicare for All Act of 2017, as the legislation is formally called, envisions some dramatic changes to the U.S. health care system \u2015 including a prohibition on private insurance, except for coverage of services outside the scope of the new government plan.\n\nThe new plan would pay for just about every medically necessary service, so that wouldn\u2019t leave much of a role, if any, for private coverage.\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t been clear whether all of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, several of whom are running for president or at least thinking about it, really want to see such a wholesale change happen \u2015 or whether their support of the Sanders proposal was simply a way of signaling support for universal health care, which can take many forms and which can include a prominent role for private insurers.\n\nCalling for Medicare for All, Kamala Harris says of private insurance: \u201dLet\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d pic.twitter.com/xT2I5IZDfT \u2014 Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) January 29, 2019\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper asked Harris about this, following an audience question on health care. \u201cFor people out there who like their insurance,\u201d Tapper asked, \u201cthey don\u2019t get to keep it?\u201d\n\nHarris didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cThe idea is that everybody gets access to medical care,\u201d she said, \u201cand you don\u2019t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho of us has not had that situation, where you\u2019ve got to wait for approval and the doctor says well, I\u2019m not sure whether your insurance company is going to cover this,\u201d Harris went on to say. \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\nThe new interest in Medicare for All, which has become a top priority for progressive politicians and activists, is a byproduct of several factors \u2015 among them, frustration that the Affordable Care Act, which for all of its success at expanding access to care, has left so many Americans still struggling to pay their medical bills.\n\nMedicare for All holds out the promise of addressing this problem, and finally reaching the elusive goal of universal coverage, by automatically enrolling everybody in the government plan and then using regulation to set prices for doctors, hospitals, and the rest of the health care industry. Typically, such proposals envision people paying for coverage entirely through taxes or income-related premiums, with little or no co-payments, deductibles, and other forms of cost-sharing.\n\nSuch a system would likely be a lot easier for patients to use, as Harris suggested, and a lot more straightforward for the providers of health care, as well, because they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about billing so many different insurers. In countries like Sweden and Taiwan, such systems deliver quality care to all residents, at a fraction of what the U.S. spends.\n\nBut the transition to the new system could be difficult, depending on the final policy details of legislation. One key factor is how well the new plan would pay doctors and hospitals, and whether they would react by reducing their capacity to see patients.\n\nWhatever the actual merits of the switch away from private insurance, surveys suggest that many Americans who have decent coverage now are nervous about changes. Just last week, a poll from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that support for a support for a Medicare for All system dropped dramatically when people learned that it would mean giving up existing insurance, although that was just one of several questions the pollsters tested.\n\nThat political vulnerability is one reason some other Democrats have stopped short of endorsing measures like the Sanders bill and instead advocated for schemes that envision less dramatic transformations \u2015 or, at least, much slower ones.\n\nSome of their plans would simply open up existing public programs to new groups of people. An example is legislation co-sponsored by Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan that would allow people 55 and older to sign up for Medicare.\n\nOther proposals envision creating a whole new government-run plan, more similar to the one in the Sanders bill, while still allowing employers to continue offering coverage to employees \u2015 and then giving employees the option of sticking with the company plan or buying into the new public program. A pair of House Democrats, Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut and Jan Schakowsky from Illinois, have put forward such a bill.\n\nOf course, these proposals, like Medicare for All, have policy downsides to go with their upsides, and political weaknesses to go with their strengths.\n\nBack in December, right after the Times op-ed, a senior aide to Harris told HuffPost that she doesn\u2019t oppose more incremental proposals, noting that Harris has also co-sponsored a few of them. The same aide said Harris is open to different ways of achieving universal coverage.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All is her preferred plan but she is also open to looking at others that achieve the same principle where health care is a right for all,\u201d the Harris staffer said. \u201cWhat she believes is that we need is a system where health care is guaranteed to every American and she will continue to look at proposals that achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nBut, the aide said, Harris worked with Sanders on crafting the 2017 bill \u2015 and \u201cbelieves it is the best solution.\u201d\n\nI mean, seriously, only in Washington is decrying insurance companies' paperwork, approvals, and delays so that EVERYONE GETS INSURANCE COVERAGE considered controversial or risky. \u2014 Ian Sams (@IanSams) January 29, 2019\n\nAnd on Monday night, following the CNN forum, Ian Sams, who is national press secretary for the Harris campaign, wrote a pair of tweets about the candidate\u2019s comments.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-larson-expand-social-security-bill-pass-house_us_5c50f4fee4b0f43e410c06e9": "J.

This is a great opportunity,\u201d Larson said.\n\nLarson expressed confidence that the legislation would pass on the House floor after going through the standard legislative process, complete with hearings that shed light on the issue of retirement security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the grassroots effort that\u2019s gone into this,\u201d he said, singling out the contributions of Social Security Works and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn the Senate, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have sponsored a companion bill, but Republican control almost certainly precludes it from consideration. The legislation\u2019s passage in the House is nonetheless an opportunity for Democrats to showcase what they would deliver if they had unified control of the federal government.\n\nPeople are OK taking a little bit of the burden on themselves as long as they understand we\u2019re dedicating the money to Social Security. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.)\n\nThe legislation raises benefits by creating a minimum payment that\u2019s 25 percent greater than the federal poverty level as well as modestly adjusting the benefit formula so that more of a person\u2019s pre-retirement income will be replaced. Larson estimates that the new benefit formula would increase the average payout by 2 percent. His legislation would not change the age at which a retiree can collect benefits.\n\nThe legislation also replaces the consumer price index, used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), with an index that better reflects seniors\u2019 expenses, particularly the higher costs of health care. The Social Security Administration\u2019s chief actuary projects that the bill\u2019s Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) would, on average, increase the COLA by about 0.2 percent.\n\nTo finance the ambitious legislation, Larson would subject earnings of $400,000 or more to the Social Security payroll tax.\n\nCurrently, Americans pay Social Security taxes only on the first $132,900 that they earn based on a cap that rises with average wage growth. The new legislation would leave income between $132,900 and $400,000 untaxed. Over time, the present-day cap would rise to $400,000, at which point all earnings would be subject to the tax.\n\nLarson\u2019s legislation would also raise the payroll tax by 1.2 percentage points on both employees and employers, phasing in the change over 24 years.\n\nAt the same time, the bill cuts income taxes on Social Security benefits for those who receive them by raising the income threshold at which they would be taxed. Under the legislation, 12 million beneficiaries \u2015 out of nearly 63 million total \u2015 would receive a tax cut, according to Larson.\n\nStill, the bill\u2019s payroll tax increase is likely to be the biggest political challenge for Larson and other Democrats trying to advance the bill.\n\nTo try to preempt that line of attack, Larson is fond of brandishing a Starbucks cup at every event promoting the bill. He calculates that for a worker making $50,000 a year, the tax hike amounts to just 50 cents a week \u2015 or one $4.50 cup of Starbucks every nine weeks.\n\nLarson, who represents Hartford, known as the nation\u2019s insurance capital, also wants Americans to view payroll taxes as an insurance premium rather than a tax, noting that its official name is FICA, or the Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax.\n\nIt helps Larson\u2019s case that his allies hail from ideologically diverse branches of the party. The co-chairs of the House\u2019s Expand Social Security Caucus that Larson started in September include Reps. Debbie Dingell (Mich.) and Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.), members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition; and Lamb, who does not belong to any ideologically driven bloc.\n\nLamb, perhaps more than anyone, attests to the low political risk of backing higher Social Security taxes to pay for solvency and benefit expansion. He endorsed the policy during his March special election win in a southwest Pennsylvania district where Donald Trump won by more than 19 percentage points in 2016.\n\n\u201cPeople are OK taking a little bit of the burden on themselves as long as they understand we\u2019re dedicating the money to Social Security,\u201d he said.\n\nLamb referred to his co-sponsorship of the bill as the fulfillment of a campaign promise and said he wants whoever the Democratic presidential nominee is to endorse the legislation.\n\nBecause Social Security is statutorily prohibited from borrowing to pay benefits, it faces a funding shortfall as more baby boomers retire in the coming years.\n\nSocial Security is projected to have enough revenue to pay out full benefits until 2034, according to the program\u2019s nonpartisan actuaries. After that, absent legislation tweaking the program\u2019s finances, it will only be able to pay out about three-quarters of promised benefits.\n\nConservatives tend to favor closing Social Security\u2019s funding gap through benefit cuts; progressives prefer plans that raise more revenue for the program.\n\nBut Larson\u2019s bill represents the culmination of efforts by left-leaning groups to look at Social Security as an essential vehicle for retirement security in a time of stagnant wages, depleted home equity and volatile 401(k) plans.\n\nThe average monthly Social Security benefit is just under $1,250. Without it, 22 million more Americans would live in poverty.\n\nLarson holds out some hope that President Donald Trump, who promised to protect Social Security from cuts as a candidate, might strike a deal to close Social Security\u2019s funding gap with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Meanwhile, officials were spotted seizing materials from Stone\u2019s apartment in Manhattan.\n\nA federal grand jury convened by Mueller indicted Stone on seven counts relating to communications with WikiLeaks, the Russia-connected outfit that released material stolen in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee servers.\n\nStone, an eccentric veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, was instrumental in President Donald Trump\u2019s early campaign effort. He continued to serve as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign after departing in August 2015, and is known to have the ear of the president.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone spoke with unnamed \u201csenior Trump campaign officials\u201d about materials WikiLeaks had that could be damaging to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The 24-page indictment accuses Stone of obstructing investigations by congressional intelligence committees and the FBI, making false statements and tampering with a witness.\n\nHere are some of the indictment\u2019s wildest parts:\n\nStone evoked \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d as he pressured someone else with knowledge of the WikiLeaks hack to lie to Congress.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone worked hard to prevent an unnamed individual \u2015 referred to as Person 2 in the indictment but identified through context as radio host Randy Credico \u2015 from contradicting testimony that Stone gave before the House intelligence committee in September 2017. Stone lied to the committee about discussions he had about WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC hack, the indictment says, and the committee wished to speak to Credico two months later.\n\nThe two men apparently discussed a scene from \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d in which the mobster Frank Pentangeli pretends to be ignorant of certain information.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn multiple occasions, including on or about December 1, 2017, STONE told Person 2 that Person 2 should do a \u201cFrank Pentangeli\u201d before HPSCI in order to avoid contradicting STONE\u2019s testimony. Frank Pentangeli is a character in the film The Godfather: Part II, which both STONE and Person 2 had discussed, who testifies before a congressional committee and in that testimony claims not to know critical information that he does in fact know.\n\n... He also suggested emulating Richard Nixon.\n\nWhen Credico texted Stone about the House intelligence committee\u2019s request for voluntary testimony in November, Stone, who worked for Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, quoted his former boss.\n\nHe wrote: \u201d\u2018Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan\u2019 ... Richard Nixon.\u201d When Credico told Stone that he was facing a subpoena, Stone pressed him to assert his 5th Amendment rights \u2015 and he did.\n\nIn related news, many photos of Stone\u2019s Nixon back tattoo emerged Friday on Twitter.\n\nCan\u2019t decide which is more disturbing, the tattoo, the fact that Nixon picture is so much bigger than Reagan, or that this now indicted guy is a close confidant and adviser to the current President of the greatest nation on earth. pic.twitter.com/myElSrq3vI \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 25, 2019\n\nAnd Stone threatened a dog.\n\nThe relationship between Stone and Credico subsequently took a downward turn, with Stone threatening the radio host\u2019s dog, Bianca.\n\n\u201cPrepare to die,\u201d Stone wrote.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nOn or about April 9, 2018, STONE wrote in an email to Person 2, \u201cYou are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds.\u201d STONE also said he would \u201ctake that dog away from you,\u201d referring to Person 2\u2019s dog. On or about the same day, STONE wrote to Person 2, \u201cI am so ready. Let\u2019s get it on. Prepare to die [expletive].\u201d\n\nA Trump campaign official \u201cwas directed\u201d to get in touch with Stone about the hack.\n\nThe indictment does not name specific Trump campaign officials or suggest what Trump himself may have known about Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks. But if an already \u201csenior\u201d official \u201cwas directed\u201d to contact Stone, few would presumably have the authority to do such directing.\n\nThe Trump campaign was very interested in what WikiLeaks may have mined from DNC servers.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nAfter the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.\n\nSomeone with knowledge of the DNC hack suggested putting out the message that Clinton was \u201cold, memory bad, has stroke.\u201d\n\nIn early August 2016, another person who knew about the WikiLeaks hack, referred to as Person 1, emailed Stone to say that the group planned two more information dumps. Right-wing author and birther conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Friday that the indictment referred to him.\n\n\u201cImpact planned to be very damaging,\u201d Corsi wrote, suggesting the Trump campaign push the idea that Clinton was in bad health. Trump himself peddled doubts about his opponent\u2019s health on the campaign trail, fueling a right-wing conspiracy theory.\n\nRyan Goodman, former special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense, said on Twitter that the idea could have \u201csignificant\u201d legal implications if it could be used to show coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.\n\nFrom the indictment:\n\nPerson 1 added in the same email, \u201cTime to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w 5 enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC. That appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke \u2013 neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for [Clinton] Foundation debacle.\u201d\n\nThe day Stone swore he had not texted or emailed with \u201cPerson 2,\u201d the two men exchanged 30 texts.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the very day Stone testified before the House intelligence committee that he never sent or received written communications with Credico, the pair \u201cexchanged over thirty text messages.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include Randy Credico\u2019s name as Person 2.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-ships-plutonium-from-red-to-blue-state_us_5c538ce7e4b01d3c1f11e676": "Nevada\u2019s governor is furious after learning that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration ignored his objections and secretly shipped weapons-grade plutonium to his state from South Carolina.\n\nDemocratic Gov.

People are not truly free when they are exhausted because they are working longer and longer hours for lower wages.\n\n\u201cPeople are not truly free when they cannot afford a decent place in which to live. People certainly are not free when they cannot afford to feed their families.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 decision to deliver his own rebuttal was met with criticism from Democrats who saw his message as an opportunity to promote himself amid rumors of a 2020 presidential bid and upstage Abrams, a rising star in the Democratic Party and the first black woman to deliver a State of the Union response.\n\nThis is a bad move, especially assuming he\u2019s going to run. It only reinforces the idea that Bernie is not serious about representing the interests of the Democratic Party. It also reads as racially tone deaf, as Stacey Abrams becomes the first Black woman to deliver the response. https://t.co/l7PLxUo7BI \u2014 Marc Lamont Hill (@marclamonthill) February 5, 2019\n\nStill, Sanders used his speech as a chance to challenge Trump\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re president, you bring our people together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in an unprecedented way, that is not what this president is doing. In fact, he is trying to divide us up; he is trying to have one group turn against another group.

However, he revealed that he had in fact worn blackface that same year as part of a Michael Jackson costume while participating in a dance contest.\n\n\u201cWhy would Governor Northman contradict what he\u2019d said less than 24 hours before?\u201d Lemon wondered.\n\nThen he answered his own question.\n\n\u201cIt does work,\u201d he said, recalling that \u201cit worked over and over and over\u201d when it came to Trump\u2019s self-defense after the infamous Access Hollywood tape surfaced in 2016, indicating he bragged about sexual assault in 2005.\n\nFirst, Trump offered a televised mea culpa, admitting to having uttered the predatory remarks, but two days later he walked that back, chalking it up to locker room talk. Eventually he began openly questioning the authenticity of the recording altogether.\n\nDespite the backlash just a month before the presidential election, he survived.\n\nAmid calls for Northam\u2019s resignation, the real debate, Lemon said, is whether the governor will survive, too.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-jersey-minimum-wage-fight-for-15_us_5c58a672e4b09293b2076153": "New Jersey\u2019s governor signed legislation Monday to gradually increase the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 per hour, marking the latest win for the Fight for $15 labor campaign.\n\nThe Garden State\u2019s wage floor will rise from its current rate of $8.85 per hour to $15 by 2024 for most workers. Small businesses that employ fewer than six people will have an extra two years before $15 becomes the minimum.\n\nThe plan, approved last week by the state\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature, makes New Jersey the fourth state to put its minimum wage on a path to $15. The three others are California, Massachusetts and New York.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy (D) said he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d to sign the legislation, \u201censuring that the most vulnerable among us will have the means to put food on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor far too long, too many of our fellow New Jerseyans have been struggling to survive on wages that have not kept up with the cost of living,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nProgressive activists and labor groups have been hugely successful in pushing minimum wage increases over the last several years, both through city and state legislation and ballot referendums. It is no coincidence many of those plans revolve around $15: That\u2019s the stated goal of the union-backed Fight for $15 campaign, which began with worker strikes in the fast food industry in 2012.\n\nThe New Jersey law will boost the minimum wage roughly $1 per year until it reaches $15.\n\nThe first places to adopt a $15 minimum wage were liberal cities with high costs of living, including Seattle and San Francisco. But the approval of such a plan in New Jersey shows an eagerness in some Democratic-controlled states to aggressively hike the wage floor statewide.\n\nThe New Jersey law will boost the minimum wage by roughly $1 per year until it reaches $15. Business groups opposed the proposal, saying it would force employers to reduce workers\u2019 hours in order to cover the higher payroll costs. Republican lawmakers uniformly opposed the legislation, but Democrats control both chambers of the statehouse.\n\nDemocrats had tried to raise the minimum wage repeatedly in recent years, but were stymied by former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican. Murphy said brokering a deal on the minimum wage would be a priority for him after being elected in 2017.\n\nProposals to subject younger workers to a lower minimum wage was ultimately not adopted, although the minimum wage for employees working for gratuities will remain well below $15.\n\nThe plan will hike the tipped rate from its current rate of $2.13 per hour to $5.13 by 2024. (When a worker\u2019s tips combined with the base wage do not amount to the regular minimum wage, the law calls for the employer to make up the difference.) Employers in the restaurant industry \u2015 and, in the case of Washington, D.C., many restaurant employees \u2015 have fought back against proposals to eliminate the separate wage floor for tipped workers, saying it would force bars and restaurants out of business.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s labor department estimated that there were roughly 300,000 workers earning the minimum wage in 2017. But the significant increase over time under the new law means the law will affect far more workers than that.

When pressed for evidence of her subsequent communication, Fairfax said he did not have any because it had happened over the phone.\n\nFairfax has become the subject of national attention in recent days as pressure mounts on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to resign. Virtually every Democratic elected official in the state has withdrawn support for Northam after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page emerged Friday. Northam initially said he appeared in the photo, which shows a man in blackface standing with another man in a Ku Klux Klan uniform, but he subsequently recanted. At a Saturday press conference, Northam nonetheless admitted to another instance of wearing blackface.\n\nFairfax, the second black statewide elected official in Virginia\u2019s history, would succeed Northam if the governor resigned. (Fairfax has not called on Northam to resign; he declined to do so again at Monday\u2019s press conference.)\n\nThe chaos escalated Sunday night as the specter of scandal spread to Fairfax as well.\n\nBig League Politics, the same conservative news site that first published Northam\u2019s yearbook photo, published a screenshot of a social media post by a woman describing her sexual assault accusation against Fairfax.\n\n\u201cImagine you were sexually assaulted during the [Democratic National Convention] in Boston in 2004 by a campaign staffer. You spend the next 13 years trying to forget it ever happened,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cUntil one day you find out he\u2019s the Democratic candidate for statewide office in a state 3,000 miles away, and he wins that election in November 2017. Then by strange, horrible luck, it seems increasingly likely he\u2019ll get a VERY BIG promotion.\u201d\n\nIn the early hours of Monday morning, Fairfax\u2019s staff issued a statement denying the allegation. The statement, co-signed by Fairfax\u2019s chief of staff Lawrence Roberts and communications director Lauren Burke, said The Washington Post had investigated the allegation the previous year and decided not to publish a story on it due to the \u201cabsence of any evidence corroborating the allegation, and significant red flags and inconsistencies within the allegation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lt. Governor will take appropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation,\u201d Roberts and Burke said.\n\nHours later, the Post published its own version of events, denying that it had unearthed any \u201cred flags\u201d when the allegation came to the newspaper\u2019s attention in November 2017.\n\nThe woman described a sexual encounter that began with consensual kissing, but she said she eventually noticed that she could not move her neck. The woman alleged that Fairfax then forced her to perform oral sex through physical coercion, according to the Post.\n\nThe Post did not publish the story in November 2017 because it \u201ccould not find anyone who could corroborate either version,\u201d and it found no evidence of similar allegations after interviewing several people who knew Fairfax in college, law school and during his political career.\n\nFairfax and his staff are sticking by their story, and are accusing the Post of acting without journalistic integrity given its professed inability to corroborate the story.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official,\u201d Burke said in a statement. \u201cWe ask further: What other major elected official in the Commonwealth of Virginia would be smeared with sexual allegations that were presented without corroboration?\u201d\n\nI asked LG Fairfax's team what they make of the Post denying there were \"red flags\" with allegation story.\n\n\n\n\"The Washington Post, acknowledging that it had no corroboration, just smeared an elected official.\" Full statement from staff is attached. pic.twitter.com/5rMtlcAenh \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 4, 2019\n\nWhen asked Monday whether he would welcome his accuser to share her story with the legislature, Fairfax did not explicitly reject the idea.\n\n\u201cAnyone is free to speak up and be heard,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a party, Democrats have declared their intolerance of sexual misconduct of any kind.\n\nThey mobilized en masse in an attempt to keep then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the high court after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her at a party in high school. Democrats argued that Ford\u2019s testimony before the Senate was credible and compelling enough to disqualify Kavanaugh from a justice position.\n\nFairfax\u2019s pushback \u2015 in particular, implying that a sexual assault survivor\u2019s allegation is less credible because the accuser reached out to the alleged assailant after the fact \u2015 has already elicited some criticism in progressive circles.\n\nMany sexual assault survivors have described befriending their attackers as a means of coping.\n\nLizzie Hylton, the political director of Clean Virginia, a Virginia-based progressive advocacy, highlighted that research, calling on Fairfax to \u201cstop spreading rape myths.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sherrod-brown-calls-schultz-total-idiot_us_5c551287e4b09293b2044bad": "Sen.

Ralph Northam (D) to resign after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page emerged Friday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats were virtually unanimous in their push for Northam to step aside, taking offense to both the photo itself \u2015 which showed one man in blackface and another in Ku Klux Klan robes \u2015 and the governor\u2019s initial acknowledgement that he was one of the men featured in it. He changed his tune at a press conference Saturday, denying that he was in the photo but admitting to wearing blackface another time. He also was widely mocked when he appeared to consider moonwalking for reporters.\n\nAfter that press conference, even the Democratic elected officials who had initially stuck by the governor began to abandon him.\n\nBut there are also high political stakes involved.\n\nDemocrats have a good chance of taking control of both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, where Republicans currently have narrow majorities, in November. Republicans now hold a three-seat majority in the state House and a two-seat advantage in the state Senate.\n\nBut Northam remaining at the top of the ticket could jeopardize Democrats\u2019 shot at unified control of state government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unimaginable scenario going into an election cycle,\u201d said an adviser to a Democratic state legislator who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cThis is the closest opportunity Democrats have had to take control of the legislature in a generation.\u201d\n\nVirginia is one of a handful of states in the country where gubernatorial and state legislative elections occur in off years when there is no congressional or presidential election to drive turnout.\n\nThe backlash to President Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016 spurred high Democratic turnout and enthusiasm in Virginia\u2019s November 2017 elections. As a result, Democrats kept control of the governorship by a comfortable margin and flipped 15 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, bringing them within a hair of taking control of the legislative chamber.\n\nGiven the current political environment, I can\u2019t see any scenario where the Republicans don\u2019t claim [Northam] is either the Klansman or the person in blackface in mail or in TV. adviser to a Democratic state legislator in Virginia, on this year's state elections\n\nEven in the minority, the new Democratic cohort produced major policy wins for the party. Building on their electoral momentum, Northam and legislative Democrats managed to pick up enough Republican support to expand Medicaid to 400,000 low-income Virginians in May using federal funding from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe party was hopeful that its legislative accomplishments, Northam\u2019s relative popularity and the seemingly unabated passion of the Democratic base could power a strong enough showing to flip both chambers. (The state Senate, which was not up for re-election in 2017, is in cycle in 2019.)\n\nUnified control of Virginia\u2019s state government could usher in a period of progressive lawmaking the likes of which the state has not experienced in decades \u2015 if at all.\n\nSome items on Democrats\u2019 agenda if they take control include raising the state\u2019s minimum wage and permanently restoring voting rights to former felons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, unified control would enable Democrats to run the redistricting process in 2021, preventing a repeat of the 2011 drawing in which Republicans heavily gerrymandered the congressional and state legislative district boundaries.\n\nBut a governor is the de facto face of a party \u2015 its chief fundraiser and advocate in the media. Candidates for state legislature frequently lack the name recognition that a highly visible figure like the governor wields.\n\nIf Northam remains in power, Democrats would not only lack the chance to deploy him as an asset in November, but also suffer from Republican willingness to turn him into a liability.\n\nNotwithstanding the Virginia GOP\u2019s willingness to traffic in explicit racial incitement \u2015 look no further than Ed Gillespie\u2019s gubernatorial bid and Corey Stewart\u2019s run for U.S. Senate \u2015 the party has pounced on the racist Northam photo.\n\nOur call for Ralph Northam's resignation stands.

Doing so, Farber wrote, \u201cwould be far more legitimate than Trump\u2019s wall effort,\u201d given the scientific community\u2019s warnings and the fact that the Pentagon has recognized that climate change is a national security threat.\n\nLate last year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S. issued separate reports concluding that averting climate catastrophe would require immediate, sweeping cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the Trump administration has downplayed the threat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump said of his own administration\u2019s report, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re the cleanest we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nBlumenauer is one of dozens of co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, a nonbinding climate resolution introduced last week by Rep.

The measure outlines the lofty goals of slashing global greenhouse gas emissions 40 to 60 percent by 2030, building climate-resilient infrastructure, and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs. Republicans were quick to dismiss it as an \u201cimpossible\u201d and \u201cpie-in-the-sky\u201d proposal, and Trump said it \u201csounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-bloomberg-trump_us_5c4c311ce4b0287e5b8af753": "Ahead of news that the partial government shutdown had ended, Michael Bloomberg made a round of speeches mocking President Donald Trump as a competence-free \u201cpretend CEO,\u201d comparing his tenure to a scary movie.\n\nSpeaking at a Friday gathering of the Democratic Business Council of Northern Virginia, the former New York City mayor flayed the president for triggering chaos in Washington.

It has historically enjoyed bipartisan support because it is structured to fight poverty by rewarding work.\n\nBut many low-wage workers eligible for the EITC, including tens of thousands in Iowa alone, are not aware of the benefit, or don\u2019t earn enough money to file their federal income tax returns, according to Scholten.\n\n\u201cThe EITC is the most effective anti-poverty policy in America,\u201d Scholten said in a press release announcing the group\u2019s founding. \u201cWorking Hero Iowa will help tens of thousands of low-income families across Iowa get cash refunds that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t receive.\u201d\n\nScholten and Sanberg also announced the group\u2019s launch at the Iowa state Capitol in Des Moines on Wednesday morning.\n\nSanberg, who amassed wealth as an investor and entrepreneur, has plowed funds into promoting access to the federal EITC and advocating for passage of an analogous state-level credit in California in 2015.\n\nHis California-based nonprofit, CalEITC4Me, has connected low-income Californians with $4 billion in EITC benefits from the federal and state governments in the past few years.\n\nScholten, 38, a former minor league baseball player and paralegal, lost to King by 3 percentage points in November.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday, Scholten said he has not yet made up his mind about a future run for office \u2015 either for U.S. Senate or for a second time in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting to see what happens with King,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd regarding the Senate seat, I\u2019m considering it.

He plans to hold events promoting the group\u2019s EITC outreach and tax preparation services across the state, including several with 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nWorking Hero Iowa is also structured as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, which allows it to engage in some types of partisan political activity.

Now, a veteran foreign correspondent on the ground is sounding the alarm, cautioning the move will enable the return of terrorism within the region and abroad.\n\nCBS News\u2019 Charlie D\u2019Agata has spent the past week in the front-line village of Ash Sha\u2019Fah, following the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as they fight what has been dubbed the \u201cfinal battle\u201d against ISIS, a last-ditch effort to quash the terror group for good before the U.S. departs. It\u2019s a title tinged with both hope and desperation.\n\nAmericans have been backing SDF with weapons, equipment and air power, but once they leave, D\u2019Agata predicts trouble.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely [the SDF will] be under threat,\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with HuffPost on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re in for the worst around here.\u201d\n\nThe fear, D\u2019Agata said, is that SDF may fall under attack from Turkey, which sees the Kurds as sworn enemies of the country.\n\nThe risk could eventually force SDF\u2019s alliance of militias to seek the help of Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad.\n\n\u201cThey feel that if the U.S. withdraws, they\u2019ll be abandoned, and they might even have to do a deal with President Assad\u2019s regime because they have to protect themselves,\u201d D\u2019Agata explained, noting Turkish-backed forces are already present in northern Syria.\n\nWhile Turkey claims it will drive ISIS out from the remaining 1 percent of land left in its control, the nation\u2019s forces don\u2019t hold a candle to the mostly Kurdish militias leading SDF, known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG for short.\n\nEmphasizing the dramatic difference, D\u2019Agata said that when it comes to the Turkish forces already present in Syria, \u201cthey don\u2019t have a fraction of the capabilities that the YPG has\u201d in terms of military hardware, support and overwatch given by the U.S.\n\nCBS News CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D\u2019Agata pictured on the ground in Syria.\n\nTrump appears firm in his decision to withdraw. But critics of his decision point to a recent terror attack that killed at least 16 people, four of whom were Americans, last Wednesday in the northern city of Manbij, arguing that ISIS is still a threat.\n\n\u201cThere have been serious questions,\u201d D\u2019Agata said of the pullout.\n\nWhile SDF has proved itself to be a strong force, \u201cthey need military support, surveillance intelligence,\u201d he added. \u201cThey simply can\u2019t do it without America\u2019s air canopy.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agata said news of Trump\u2019s move was met with utter astonishment from militias continuing to battle what\u2019s left of ISIS.\n\n\u201cPeople were shocked, disappointed, confused. They are cornering the last remaining fighters and they\u2019re worried about what might happen without U.S. support there.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019re not the only ones voicing concern. American military officials also reportedly oppose the move, along with Israelis, U.S. evangelicals who generally favor Trump, and numerous senators including presidential ally Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who stands to gain more power in the region with the departure of U.S. troops, has praised Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nThe real solution, D\u2019Agata explained, wasn\u2019t as simple as whittling down ISIS\u2019s territorial control to the 1 percent that Trump has touted as a success.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. withdraws, it will embolden ISIS \u2026 and they will re-emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of ISIS sympathizers in the region. You can take away their territory, but they still exist.\u201d\n\nThough there is no definitive answer on just how fast they\u2019d spring back, D\u2019Agata said it\u2019s likely.\n\nBut Americans are paying less attention to Syria now, presenting another obstacle for reporters as they try to spotlight the ongoing conflict.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and [I] have invested so much time and effort in covering this region,\u201d D\u2019Agata said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge domestic news cycle, and we appreciate that \u2026 we understand that.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, it is indeed a domestic issue in terms of the potential for terror threats at home.

Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) was elected chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Trade despite a voting history that irked organized labor.\n\nDemocrats rejected a stalwart union ally\u2019s bid to chair the House panel charged with overseeing international trade, in favor of a more business-friendly choice.\n\nDemocratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday elected Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) as chairman of the panel\u2019s Subcommittee on Trade, defying organized labor and left-leaning trade critics who had pushed for Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) to get the top spot in conversations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other top Democrats.\n\nIn particular, Blumenauer drew ire among critics of corporate influence in trade agreements for his key role in enabling passage of trade promotion authority in 2015. Known as fast-track authority, it assures presidents an up-or-down vote in Congress on international trade deals, precluding a lengthy debate and amendment process. At the time, it was widely viewed as a prerequisite for passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a controversial 12-nation trade pact negotiated by then-President Barack Obama but opposed by a majority of House Democrats.\n\nReferring to the subcommittee vote, a House Democratic aide who requested anonymity for professional reasons said, \u201cThey threw labor under the bus and gave them the middle finger.\u201d\n\nUnions are taking a more pragmatic approach, shifting their focus to keeping pressure on Blumenauer.\n\n\u201cThis chairman, though he was not our preferred choice \u2014 you play the hand you get dealt, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said a union official involved in lobbying for Pascrell who requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nAs if to validate unions\u2019 concerns, the pro-business conservative Club for Growth praised Blumenauer\u2019s selection.\n\nBlumenauer is a radical Lefty on most things, but on trade, he's pretty decent. Big Sugar is no fan of him, and that's good. https://t.co/Yu2I7wiiVY \u2014 Club for Growth (@club4growth) January 16, 2019\n\nPascrell\u2019s backers were particularly peeved that Ways and Means members did not give precedence to his recent experience as a trade policy leader.\n\nBlumenauer has a year of seniority over Pascrell in Congress, having arrived in 1996.\n\nBut in the last Congress, when Democrats were in the minority, Pascrell served as the ranking Democrat on the trade subcommittee. Blumenauer declined the top job, which requires hard work without the perks and power of a chairmanship. (Blumenauer told HuffPost in an interview this month that he had simply wanted to focus on defending the Affordable Care Act, which was then under attack.)\n\nAnd while defying party leadership is often grounds for political exile in Congress, Blumenauer has advanced despite a very public act of insubordination. He not only supported fast-track approval for trade deals in 2015 but also defied Democratic leaders in voting for a rule that enabled it to come up for a vote.\n\n\u201cIt seems completely illogical,\u201d the aide said.\n\nThe committee\u2019s rejection of Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a dyed-in-the-wool advocate of pro-business free trade agreements far more anathema to unions than Blumenauer, might have provided some solace to progressive trade hawks. But most Congress watchers never considered Kind a real contender, thanks to his vote against the election of California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker this month.\n\nPascrell may have been hampered by the failure of left-wing activists to land spots on the Ways and Means Committee for some of the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019 most outspoken stars.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) on Ways and Means fell short last week.\n\nThe influential panel, which has broad authority over tax and trade policy, now has 25 Democratic members, of whom 11 are new. Eight of those 11 are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but since there are no ideological prerequisites for membership in the nominally left-leaning CPC, few of them are reliably populist firebrands.\n\nLauren Victoria Burke/Associated Press Organized labor and left-leaning trade critics had hoped that Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) would chair the Subcommittee on Trade.\n\nAlthough trade policy is often the province of a small coterie of interest groups and experts, it could be an area of enormous influence for Democrats in the new Congress. President Donald Trump needs approval from both houses of Congress to enact a revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nTrade policy has divided the Democratic Party in recent decades, with Obama and Bill Clinton signing major international trade agreements against the wishes of organized labor and many congressional Democrats.\n\nAdvocates for free trade agreements argue that they provide cheaper goods for American consumers and new markets for American exporters, as well as magnify soft U.S. power on the global stage.\n\nCritics in organized labor have charged that lowering trade barriers with lower-wage countries costs the United States middle-class jobs and encourages a global race to the bottom in labor and environmental standards. Other opponents of trade deals focus on their protection of prescription drug patent monopolies and corporate sops like the international arbitration system, through which companies can challenge signatories\u2019 domestic laws.\n\nTrump broke with his recent Democratic and Republican predecessors by running as an unabashed opponent of international trade agreements. Dissatisfaction with those accords likely helped him win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2015 industry-heavy states that Obama won twice.\n\nA dirty secret of the present political moment is that unions and other left-leaning critics of past trade policy see Trump\u2019s aggressive enforcement of trade rules in general and get-tough approach with China in particular as an improvement on the status quo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one area where Trump has kinda, sorta delivered,\u201d said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, which studies corporate consolidation and power.\n\nThe union official put it more bluntly: \u201cEven a broken clock is right twice a day.\u201d\n\nThe only question for organized labor, Stoller and other trade hawks is whether Democrats will counter Trump\u2019s efforts to reconfigure American trade relations with their own, more progressive form of trade populism or return to the more corporate-friendly, Clinton-Obama paradigm.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a reimagining of what our global order looks like \u2015 and it isn\u2019t going to look like America being a sucker all the time anymore,\u201d Stoller said.\n\nIn his interview this month, Blumenauer strongly disputed any notion that he was a down-the-line free trade proponent, noting his opposition to the Central American and Colombian trade agreements.\n\nHe also insisted that he has a long record of supporting tougher enforcement of trade rules, including but not limited to the issue of illegal logging \u2015 a key concern in Oregon.\n\n\u201cI was all over the Obama people because they weren\u2019t aggressive enough,\u201d Blumenauer said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senators-hilariously-agonize-over-whether-to-share-cardi-bs-shutdown-video_us_5c40f043e4b027c3bbbf7adc": "Two Democratic senators had a public discussion on Twitter that most would have reserved for DM.

The votes generally fell along party lines, with Republicans saying the hike would be too extreme, particularly in more rural areas.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker, the new Democratic governor, has already indicated he would sign what he called \u201chistoric legislation,\u201d saying $15 was an appropriate floor across the state.\n\nThe minimum wage in Illinois is currently $8.25 per hour. The bill would gradually raise it in installments, first to $9.25 next January, then to $10 next July, and then $1 each new year until 2025, when it would reach $15. Backers of the bill argued that the piecemeal increases would create less of a shock for employers having to pay the higher wages.\n\nChicago Tribune via Getty Images Many Democratic lawmakers have gotten onboard with the concept of a $15 minimum wage thanks to the Fight for $15, a union-backed worker campaign that began in the fast-food industry in 2012.\n\nThe legislation and the politics surrounding it are similar to what just happened in New Jersey, where a $15 plan was signed into law earlier this month. Democrats in both states previously controlled both chambers of the statehouse, but winning the governor\u2019s mansion as well has given them the opportunity to pass progressive laws over the objection of Republicans.\n\nPritzker, like Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in New Jersey, has said hiking the minimum wage would be a priority for his administration. His predecessor, Republican Bruce Rauner, vetoed a similar bill Democrats sent him in 2017.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers by and large have gotten onboard with the concept of a $15 minimum wage \u2015 a progressive pipe dream just a few years ago \u2015 thanks almost entirely to the Fight for $15, a union-backed worker campaign that began in the fast-food industry in 2012. The sight of McDonald\u2019s workers walking off the job in protest of low pay helped spur legislation and ballot initiatives in cities and states across the country.\n\nNow it seems there is little to stop $15 proposals in blue states where Democrats control the levers of government. Illinois is now on track to become the fifth state with a $15 floor, following California, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.\n\nEven so, the Illinois bill is not an unqualified victory for unions and worker groups. In a win for the service industry, the legislation does not touch what\u2019s known as the \u201ctip credit\u201d \u2015 the ability of restaurants and other gratuity-based businesses to pay a lower base minimum wage, letting tips make up the difference. The legislation will allow restaurants to continue paying 60 percent of the regular minimum wage.\n\nThat means the lower tipped minimum wage will go up over time, eventually to $9 when the regular minimum wage hits $15, but it won\u2019t be eliminated the way liberal groups have sought.\n\nEmployers can also pay a lower minimum wage to minors who work fewer than 650 hours annually, the equivalent of about 16 full-time weeks. That minimum wage will top out at $13, rather than $15, in 2025.\n\nRepublicans had also sought a lower minimum wage outside the more expensive Chicago area but didn\u2019t get it.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-obamacare-meme-kermit_n_5c67e050e4b033a79942ebe3": "Twitter users dunked on Donald Trump Jr. after he shared yet another inaccurate meme on Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s son likened his father\u2019s declaration of a national emergency to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 enaction of the Affordable Care Act with this image of Kermit the Frog sipping tea:\n\nThe caption read: \u201cRemember when we weren\u2019t given a choice about Obamacare?

So here\u2019s your guide to what\u2019s happening with the Mueller probe and what comes next.\n\nAll right, so this is all about Russian interference in the 2016 election. What have we learned about that?\n\nA decent amount so far, but we don\u2019t yet have the full picture. Much of the media coverage of the Mueller investigation has focused on the Americans in Trump\u2019s orbit who have been caught up in the probe. But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media.\n\nOne reason those cases don\u2019t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there\u2019s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they\u2019re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments \u2014 one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 \u2014 are essential parts of the Mueller probe.\n\nThe first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system\u201d and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals \u2015 most of them military intelligence officers \u2015 \u201cconducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public.\n\nOK, other than all those Russians, who in Trump\u2019s circle has Mueller indicted?\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone.\n\nThere were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don\u2019t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn\u2019t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon.\n\nWho has the Mueller investigation found committed crimes?\n\nThe special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates.\n\nManafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial.\n\nIs anyone going to prison?\n\nPapadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat about Paul Manafort?\n\nManafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time.\n\nAfter he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller\u2019s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews \u2015 committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI.\n\nHow long has this Mueller probe been going on?\n\nMueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them \u2015 named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhen is the Mueller report coming out?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it\u2019s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It\u2019s unclear what form that would take.\n\nWhat kind of operation is Mueller running?\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty tight ship. There haven\u2019t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves).\n\nHow has Trump\u2019s legal team responded?\n\nBy getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI \u2015 generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization \u2015 was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau\u2019s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton\u2019s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election.\n\nAfter the Mueller probe wraps up, is that it?\n\nNo. There have been some clear signs that Mueller\u2019s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren\u2019t on Mueller\u2019s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it\u2019s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney\u2019s office without setting off a bunch of alarms.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump\u2019s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August.\n\nSo that\u2019s how Jeff Bezos\u2019 dick pics fit into all this?\n\nRight. The Enquirer published Bezos\u2019 intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos \u2014 the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn\u2019t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There\u2019s a question whether what he calls \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d violates AMI\u2019s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let\u2019s say, a complexifier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in everything?\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2015 based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public.\n\nRosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He\u2019s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed.\n\nWho is Matt Whitaker, and how the heck did he become Rosenstein\u2019s boss?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn\u2019t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush\u2019s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe.\n\nWhere does WikiLeaks fit in?\n\nA key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails\u2019 release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election.\n\nSome of the special counsel\u2019s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone.\n\nSo what is Roger Stone charged with, exactly?\n\nMueller\u2019s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel\u2019s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering.\n\nThe indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury \u2014 referring to a scene in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to \u2014 and threatened Credico\u2019s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIs there anyone else implicated in the Roger Stone indictment?\n\nThere\u2019s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted.\n\nDraft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year.\n\n\n\nGuess we should talk more about Michael Cohen\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress.\n\nHis indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization\u2019s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted.\n\nCohen told investigators that at Trump\u2019s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nWhat ended up happening with the Moscow Trump Tower?\n\nIt never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen\u2019s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with that secret Supreme Court battle?\n\nThis one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business \u2015 called \u201cCorporation\u201d from \u201cCountry A\u201d in court filings \u2015 trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the \u201cCorporation\u201d has to comply with the subpoena, but didn\u2019t explain its decision.\n\nAll this mystery could amount to nothing \u2015 it\u2019s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation.\n\nDoes it matter that the Democrats now control the House?\n\nIt does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe. This would also potentially help bring the Mueller investigation findings into the public eye if the White House or new attorney general attempts to suppress the report.\n\nIs Don Jr. going to prison?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. isn\u2019t currently facing any charges, so at least in the short term, the answer is no. But ever since the special counsel indicted Cohen for lying to Congress, there has been an increased focus on whether Trump Jr. could face similar charges.\n\nTrump Jr. told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that he never directly or indirectly sought foreign assistance for his dad\u2019s campaign. However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion. He held a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the resolution\u2019s main sponsor, finally pushed his bill through on a 248-177 vote after Republicans repeatedly blocked it in the previous session. The measure invokes congressional authority over war and peace to require President Donald Trump to withdraw U.S. forces involved in fighting in Yemen, except those battling the local branch of al Qaeda.\n\nIt reiterates the message of a similar bill that passed the Senate late last year, and supporters hope the legislation will soon make it through the upper chamber again. Passage would force Trump to change course or justify a veto by explaining his ongoing support for a policy that has killed thousands of Yemenis and contributed to mass starvation there since the U.S. began helping the Saudi-led coalition in 2015.\n\n\u201cToday is historic,\u201d Khanna said in a statement after the vote. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the direction people are pushing our party to take on foreign policy, promoting restraint and human rights and with the sense they want Congress to play a much larger role.\u201d\n\nThe measure\u2019s success in the House shows how much progress congressional critics of the war and activist groups have made in challenging the flow of American bombs, fuel and intelligence to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others battling Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.\n\nRepublican leadership stymied them in the House for years, shielding Trump from having to make a decision and protecting a strategy they view as a check on Tehran. They have used legislative maneuvers in three separate instances to keep Khanna\u2019s bill off the House floor.\n\nSkeptics of the war focused instead on winning over senators, tying concerns over Yemen to anger over the Saudi state\u2019s role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With a Senate win under their belt, they pushed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to promise an early vote once the new Democratic House came into session \u2015 and on Wednesday, she made good.\n\nAll Democrats present in the chamber and 18 Republicans ultimately voted for the measure. More than 50 Democrats did, however, back a successful GOP-led amendment affirming the president\u2019s right to share intelligence with foreign countries on vaguely defined national security grounds \u2015 a signal that will reassure Riyadh and make the next Senate effort more complicated, as the body will now no longer be voting on the same language it considered back in December.\n\nPressure from Congress and growing global frustration with the Saudis have driven the warring parties to take negotiations more seriously. Even Trump felt compelled last year to rein in U.S. military support, officially ending the practice of refueling Saudi coalition planes midair to allow them to take longer bombing runs \u2015 though he still has the right to change his mind, barring congressional action. A United Nations-brokered cease-fire has held since December with only a few exceptions.\n\nBut conditions are worsening for the tens of millions of Yemenis now dependent on some form of aid, and there\u2019s been little progress on that front. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is continuing its saber-rattling on Iran while downplaying outrage over Khashoggi, and there\u2019s growing evidence that American weapons given to the Saudi coalition have ended up in more dangerous hands.\n\nMuch of the GOP continues to argue that Yemen should be viewed primarily as a venue for confronting Iran, which has supplied the insurgent Houthi militia there.

It\u2019s a humanitarian challenge to us,\u201d Pelosi told reporters during a press conference Thursday.\n\nPelosi suggested Republicans could regret the precedent set by such a declaration, hinting that a future Democratic president could declare an emergency on gun violence.\n\n\u201cThe precedent that the president is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course we will respond accordingly when we review our options.\u201d\n\nReporter: The president just said that he will declare a national emergency when he signs this bill. Do you still plan to file a legal challenge?\n\n\n\nPelosi: That\u2019s an option and we\u2019ll review our options. ..

The 10-9 vote was along party lines, with every Democrat on the committee opposed.\n\nUnder current rules, senators have up to 30 hours to debate a nominee after they have voted to advance the nomination to a final vote \u2015 otherwise known as post-cloture time. Republicans say Democrats are wildly abusing this process to slow the confirmation of many noncontroversial lower court and administrative nominees. They point out that some government agencies are having to run with a bare-bones staff because many of their lower-ranking administrative nominees are still awaiting a confirmation vote.\n\nThe GOP proposal, which was introduced by committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and by James Lankford (R-Okla.), would limit that post-cloture debate time to two hours per nominee \u2015 significantly speeding up the process. It\u2019s similar to a temporary deal on nominations that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) negotiated with Republicans in 2013 \u2015 except the Blunt proposal would change the rules permanently.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to abuse the system like Democrats have been and not expect for people to try to end that abuse,\u201d Blunt told HuffPost last week.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees for lower-level government posts have had an unusually high number of calls for Senate cloture votes to cut off debate and move to the final vote, according to the Pew Research Center. However, Republicans employed the tactic of drawing out debate with equal zeal to slow the confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees after his re-election in 2012, a pattern that led to Reid\u2019s rules change in 2013.\n\nMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the rules committee, said during the markup hearing that Republicans are pursuing the change \u201conly because they want to ram more nominees through.\u201d She noted that part of the reason some government agencies aren\u2019t running at full capacity is that the White House simply hasn\u2019t nominated anyone to the posts.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal; this is not just a minor proposal to come our way,\u201d Klobuchar said on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the proposal was reported favorably out of committee on Wednesday, it will likely fall short of the 60-vote threshold necessary for final passage due to Democratic opposition. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier this week that he would oppose it unless Republicans agree to move the threshold on Supreme Court nominations back up to 60 votes or restore the use of \u201cblue slips\u201d over judicial nominees. Republicans abandoned the long-standing tradition after Trump\u2019s election, a practice that has been followed by both parties for decades and allows senators from a nominee\u2019s state to express their opinion on the individual.\n\nRepublicans suggested on Wednesday that they intend to move forward and pass the new rules proposal unilaterally by going \u201cnuclear\u201d on the Senate floor \u2015 a move that would require only 51 votes for approval.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a top ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said during the hearing.\n\nFew things generate acrimony in the Senate like rules changes \u2015 especially from those who are in the minority. Democrats complained about GOP obstruction on nominations under Obama and eliminated the 60-vote threshold on the president\u2019s picks to appeals courts as a result. When Republicans took power, McConnell subsequently changed the rules on Supreme Court nominations in order to confirm Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said a Republican proposal to change Senate rules and confirm presidential nominees more quickly does not \u201cin any way seriously disadvantage the minority.\u201d\n\nIn the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans have confirmed judicial nominees at a historic pace with scores of conservative new appeals, circuit and district court judges in the federal judiciary. They\u2019ve also succeeded in confirming two of Trump\u2019s picks to the Supreme Court: Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s refusal in 2016 to consider Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, remains a raw issue among many Democrats in the Senate. The blockade of Garland came up, again and again, at the hearing on Wednesday after Republicans complained about \u201crecord\u201d Democratic obstruction in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt was a conscious decision made by the majority leader to deny us the ordinary tradition of filling this vacancy,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told McConnell at one point.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/severance-pay-required-toys-r-us_us_5c632e94e4b03de942966c22": "The recent mass store closures at retail chains Toys R Us and Sears have spawned a campaign to guarantee severance pay to laid-off workers. Its backers now face their first big legislative test: a bill in New Jersey that would make severance a requirement for large employers.\n\nIf the proposal succeeds, similar bills will almost certainly pop up in other states, the way minimum wage laws and paid sick leave protections have spread across the country in recent years, particularly in blue states.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the hope of workers like Bruce Miller. He lost his job as a Sears auto technician in 2018 when his store in Toms River, New Jersey, closed. He had 36 years with the company and received eight weeks of severance pay, an amount he believes should have been greater. He said severance should be mandatory and based on an employee\u2019s length of service.\n\n\u201cMost workers put their heart and soul into the job,\u201d said Miller, 56, who testified in favor of the bill last week. \u201cNot getting severance after you\u2019ve been there so many years, it\u2019s a punch in the gut. It\u2019s not fair to anybody out there.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey proposal, which was recently introduced in the state Senate, would assure laid-off workers one week of pay for every year they\u2019d worked at the company, which would be paid out by the employer, not the state. Had such a law been in place when Sears was axing workers, Miller would have received roughly nine months of salary, rather than two \u2015 a greater financial cushion for him and a greater cost for Sears.\n\nThe bill would make significant changes to the state\u2019s mass layoff law, which is based on the federal WARN Act. In addition to the severance requirement, it would increase the amount of advance notice that employers must give workers before making cuts: from 60 days to 90 days. Employers who failed to give such a heads-up would have to pay a minimum of four weeks of severance to an affected worker, no matter how long the worker\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe severance pay would come on top of the notice time during which the workers were still being paid, meaning the severance wouldn\u2019t kick in until after the 90 days had passed. The law would apply only to companies that were laying off 50 or more employees, meaning smaller businesses wouldn\u2019t be on the hook.\n\nEven so, business groups say the proposal worries them. Michael Egenton, a lobbyist with the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said the mandatory severance provision might be hard for failing businesses to meet. He argued that employers might balk at expanding into New Jersey if there were more workplace mandates, noting also the recent passage of a law requiring a $15 minimum wage by 2024.\n\n\u201cOur bigger concern is everyone is entitled to severance regardless of the financial situation,\u201d Egenton said, adding that he had industries other than retail in mind. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want our members in the pharmaceutical bio industry to start getting nervous, wondering what happens if [they] have to move employees around.\u201d\n\nNot getting severance after you\u2019ve been there so many years, it's a punch in the gut. Bruce Miller, a 36-year Sears employee who received just eight weeks of severance pay\n\nAs with the vast majority of states, severance pay is currently optional in New Jersey under most circumstances. Many companies therefore decline to offer any. Toys R Us, which was headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, didn\u2019t give store employees the severance they expected after it announced last year that the chain was shutting down. Only when workers organized and embarrassed the chain\u2019s owners did they establish a severance fund.\n\nThe effort in New Jersey grew directly out of that Toys R Us campaign. Infuriated over the lack of severance, former Toys R Us employees began publicly protesting against the bankrupt company\u2019s debtholders last year. They took on the name Rise Up Retail and began agitating for better protections for all retail workers who lose their jobs. The effort is backed by the Organization United for Respect, which has a history of organizing Walmart employees, and the liberal advocacy group Center for Popular Democracy.\n\nRise Up Retail has taken special aim at chains that were bought by private equity groups or hedge funds and later went bankrupt: Bain Capital and KKR in the case of Toys R Us and billionaire Eddie Lampert in the case of Sears. While all Toys R Us stores in the U.S. have closed, Lampert recently reached a deal to keep 425 Sears stores open.\n\nCarrie Gleason, policy director at Rise Up Retail, said laid-off workers would be less reliant on unemployment benefits if they received a week of pay for every year they\u2019d worked at a company. She also argued that investors might be less likely to close a struggling business and more eager to rescue it if shutting the doors required paying out severance. The owners of Toys R Us, she noted, rejected some offers to buy and reorganize the chain.\n\n\u201cIf you could imagine where someone got three months\u2019 notice [and] then a week of severance for every year, they would just about have enough [of] the real time it takes to find a job,\u201d Gleason said. At chains like Sears and Toys R Us, she added, many workers were mid-career or older and suddenly found themselves having to start over while facing age discrimination.\n\nAs for whether her group will push for severance laws beyond New Jersey, \u201cWe\u2019re already hearing from interested policymakers around the country,\u201d Gleason said.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images\n\nZach Herman, a researcher at the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state legislation around the country, said New Jersey is the only state with such a proposal on the table so far this year. Maine, he noted, already has a similar severance law on the books, requiring a week\u2019s pay for each year of service in mass layoffs, although only for employees with at least three years on the job. Several other states require severance only when the employer fails to give the legally obligated warning. (That\u2019s the current law in New Jersey.)\n\nThe proposal has a good chance of passing in New Jersey, where Democrats control both chambers of the statehouse and the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, has promised progressive reforms. Still, Egenton, of the state chamber of commerce, said he hopes a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d can be reached, with softer severance provisions to placate businesses. He also said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if employers fought the measure in court if it became law.\n\nBruce Miller said he hopes the bill passes as is. He worked on commission at Sears, and his earnings fell late in his career as the company\u2019s business dropped off. He was already facing foreclosure when he lost his job, he said. If he\u2019d had a week\u2019s salary for every year he worked, Miller added, maybe he could have worked out arrangements with his lender rather than losing his home.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-15-minimum-wage-majority_us_5c3f9b59e4b041e98ffa4ef1": "Democrats introduced a bill Wednesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, their first step in an effort to shepherd such a hike through the House as the new majority.\n\nThe Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced previously in different forms, would boost the wage floor incrementally until it reaches $15 in 2024, after which it would rise each year according to an inflation index. If it were to become law, the proposal would more than double the current federal rate of $7.25 per hour and supersede most state minimum wages.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders introduced the same measure in the Senate, with 31 Democratic co-sponsors. On Twitter, the Vermont independent called $7.25 a \u201cstarvation wage.\u201d\n\nThe measure is a long way from becoming law. Republicans still hold a majority in the Senate and have declined to work with Democrats on any increase, let alone one this significant. It would also need approval from the White House, where President Donald Trump has been pulling the reins off businesses, not putting new ones on.\n\nEven so, the bill\u2019s introduction highlights new opportunities for Democrats. The party has been unable to move a minimum wage bill out of committee for several years as Republicans held full control of Congress. House GOP leaders haven\u2019t held a hearing or markup on the minimum wage since taking the chamber in 2010. Democrats have decided to make the measure one of their first orders of business after picking up 40 House seats in the November midterm elections.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (center), hope to pass a minimum wage bill now that they have a majority. However, the legislation's prospects look bleak in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nIt is not clear yet whether Democrats would have all the votes they need among their own party. Some moderate members in states with low costs of living may be leery of doubling the federal minimum wage in just a few years. But Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the new chair of the House Committee on Education and Labor, told HuffPost previously that he\u2019s confident the party will rally around the plan.\n\n\u201cIf you do it gradually, all the economic research I\u2019ve seen shows that it can work,\u201d Scott said last month. \u201cIf you try to do it all at once, you do have job loss, and [the] economists we\u2019ve talked to get a little nervous if you try to do it too quickly. But a gradual increase over the years, to get us to $15, improves people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe House measure had 181 co-sponsors as of Wednesday. It would need 218 votes to pass.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.), the ranking Republican on the committee, released a statement indicating the proposal would have little to no GOP support and saying it would \u201cderail\u201d economic growth.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s bill signals that House Democrats would rather promote Bernie Sanders\u2019 extreme and unworkable campaign platform than accept that Republican pro-growth policies deliver real results to the American people,\u201d she said.\n\nThe federal wage floor currently prevails in the 21 states that don\u2019t already mandate a higher one. It hasn\u2019t budged since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed by President George W. Bush went into effect.\n\nThe push behind the bill shows just how much the debate surrounding the minimum wage has shifted within the Democratic Party. A few years ago, party leaders were proposing $9 and $10 per hour. But the success of the union-backed Fight for $15 campaign has made a $15 minimum wage the default progressive position, even making its way into the official Democratic platform.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-government-shutdown-reopen-deal_us_5c4b4dd6e4b0e1872d436a2c": "President Donald Trump announced Friday a short-term plan that will reopen the government for three weeks so that border security negotiations may continue without the devastating effects of the partial government shutdown.\n\nTrump said he\u2019s prepared to sign a bill to open the government through Feb. 15.

Without the new deal, those agencies would close down again on Saturday, and for many lawmakers, avoiding another shutdown is reason enough to vote for the bill.\n\nBut Republican and Democratic leaders are also going around to their members and selling the agreement as a win for their side when the truth is a bit more drawish.\n\nNo, President Donald Trump does not get money for a concrete wall \u2015 or even as much money as Senate appropriators were discussing in the spring for physical barriers \u2015 but the deal does include $1.375 billion for \u201cbollard fencing.\u201d If you don\u2019t know what bollard fencing is, it sort of looks like a massive steel wall.\n\nDemocrats will be able to tout that the bill explicitly blocks Trump from using that fencing in certain areas, and that Trump can only use wall designs that are currently in use, and that Trump only gets 55 miles of new fencing. But Democrats are coming off of their position that $0 ought to go to a physical barrier.\n\nTrump will get to stand in front of the new fencing and point to it as his wall, and he\u2019ll still be able to declare a national emergency and try to raid other accounts for more wall money. There are no policy riders in the bill blocking Trump from that gambit, though such a move will almost certainly get tied up in the courts.\n\nRegardless of who\u2019s actually winning on the policy, Democrats are almost certainly winning on the politics.\n\nOne of the most complicated issues in the deal is the number of detention beds at the border. If you listen to Democrats, the deal will reduce the number of detention beds to 40,520, which is the number Congress previously agreed to. But, if you talk to Republicans, the legislation actually removes the cap and funds an average of 45,274 beds, according to Vox. A senior Democratic aide told HuffPost that there are currently 49,057 beds in use, so even though lawmakers are funding more than what they previously authorized, that\u2019s just to provide for a \u201cglide path\u201d to get to the mandated limit.\n\nThe truth is, we might not know exactly what these provisions do until we see the legislative text \u2015 and even then, the Trump administration could find a way to work around the law. Either way, they\u2019re still a far cry from the policies of those who want to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d or dramatically curb the United States\u2019 immigrant detention policies.\n\nThere\u2019s also a grab bag of other items that didn\u2019t go Democrats\u2019 way. The legislation won\u2019t include back pay for federal contractors who were shut out of their job for 35 days during the last shutdown. The bill won\u2019t restrain the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d sometimes referred to as the \u201cGlobal Gag Rule,\u201d which blocks funding for NGOs offering abortion services or counseling. And, in the words of one senior Republican aide, it maintains a number of other \u201cpro-life provisions\u201d that Democrats looked to address.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats point out that the legislation delivers a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal workers, increases the current spending for the census by a $1 billion, and provides $17 billion for new infrastructure projects.\n\nBut regardless of who\u2019s actually winning on the policy, Democrats are almost certainly winning on the politics.\n\nDemocratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats would support the deal, which seemed to square with what progressives said as well. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of the most liberal voices in Congress, told HuffPost he was \u201cinclined to be supportive\u201d and predicted that only \u201ca handful\u201d of Democrats would vote no.\n\nAnother California progressive, Rep. Jared Huffman, also predicted a small number of defections and said he was \u201cprobably a yes.\u201d\n\nWhile Huffman expressed concern about a few provisions and Democrats muddying their moral argument against walls \u2015 \u201cThere\u2019s a small amount of mud that I will concede\u201d \u2015 he said he thought this was overall a pretty good deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody should be claiming this as a victory, certainly not a complete victory, but I think there is a recognition that you can\u2019t fight every battle as your last one,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd plenty of other progressive Democrats seemed to be on the same page Wednesday. The only Democrat HuffPost talked to who seemed to be leaning no \u2015 though said she was still undecided \u2015 was Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). The freshman congresswoman said she was particularly concerned about accountability and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut if Democratic leaders can contain their defections to single digits, it will certainly seem like Democrats won this deal, particularly if a significant number of Republicans also defect from their leaders and vote no.\n\nI don\u2019t know that anybody should be claiming this as a victory, certainly not a complete victory, but I think there is a recognition that you can\u2019t fight every battle as your last one. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.)\n\nWhile only a handful of Democrats look poised to break ranks, dozens of Republicans seem prepared to do so, even with Trump supporting the bill.\n\nIf Trump started trashing the deal \u2015 or just sounding more tepid than he already does \u2015 Republicans defections could multiply. Suddenly, this bipartisan deal could look like a huge win for Democrats and a big loss for Republicans, just by virtue of a nearly united Democratic caucus voting for the bill and Republicans splitting off.\n\nMost members of the Freedom Caucus already sounded uncomfortable with the legislation before its release, and there are even members recycling the old complaint that there won\u2019t be enough time to \u201cRead The Bill\u201d before they vote on it.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do a one-week [continuing resolution] so we can all read it and know what\u2019s in it, fund the government, and make an informed vote?

Omar suggested that politicians support Israel because of money from lobbyists, later naming the American Israel Public Affairs Committee specifically. Trump called for Omar\u2019s resignation while Pence suggested that she should \u201cface consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress, much less the Foreign Affairs Committee,\u201d Pence tweeted.\n\nTapper, however, pointed out the obvious hypocrisy in the White House\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that this White House finds more offensive than a politician feeding into stereotypes about Jews and Jewish money and controlling politicians,\u201d Tapper said mockingly before playing a clip of Trump speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition in 2015 while campaigning for the presidency.\n\n\u201cI know why you\u2019re not going to support me,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want your money ... you want to control your own politician, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nTapper jokingly insisted he wanted producers to air a clip of Omar \u2014 not of Trump \u2014 making anti-Semitic comments, but each time the segment cut to tape, the control room aired another example of Trump peddling an anti-Semitic trope.\n\nThe CNN host capped off the segment by re-airing Trump\u2019s remark that there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d marching among neo-Nazis and white supremacists at a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to take a quick break,\u201d Tapper said, feigning frustration with his producers. \u201cWe\u2019re having some issues here sorting which anti-Semitic tropes are offensive and which ones are not.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-poll-republicans-russian-interference_n_5c631e27e4b0b50014aa989d": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Nearly two years into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds that only a minority of Republican voters believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAnd even though a number of former Trump campaign officials have already pleaded guilty to crimes, a large chunk of Trump voters believes Mueller will eventually conclude that no one on Trump\u2019s team broke any laws.\n\nJust 27 percent of Republicans believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the poll found, with 54 percent saying Russia didn\u2019t play a role and the remainder unsure. By contrast, 80 percent of Democrats and half of the public overall say they believe Russia interfered in the election.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation has led to the indictments of 13 Russians accused of posing as Americans and using social media to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, as well as 12 Russian intelligence officers charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen documents.\n\nWhile members of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2015 George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and Michael Cohen \u2015 have already admitted criminal wrongdoing, 43 percent of Republicans think Mueller\u2019s investigation will conclude that nobody on the Trump campaign committed any crimes. An additional 38 percent expect the investigation to find that members of the Trump campaign, but not the president, commited crimes. Just 6 percent of Republicans expect Mueller to implicate the president.\n\nDemocrats have extremely high expectations the Mueller probe will reach the White House, with 60 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Clinton voters saying they believe Mueller will conclude that Trump himself committed crimes. (Federal prosecutors have already said that Trump \u2015 who they referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d \u2015 directed Cohen to make illegal payments to cover up alleged affairs that could have hurt his campaign.)\n\nOpinions on the Mueller investigation have changed relatively little over the past year, according to the survey, despite a number of new indictments and other developments. Americans are split 38 percent to 37 percent on whether they approve or disapprove of the FBI\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation; in February 2018, they were split 35 percent to 37 percent.\n\nAs in past polling, opinions remain largely ossified along partisan lines, and often even more sharply along electoral ones. Just 34 percent of Trump voters have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with nearly three-quarters believing the bureau is biased against the president. By contrast, 84 percent of Clinton voters express at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, with about two-thirds expecting the agency to deal fairly with Trump. Both sets of numbers are little changed from the previous survey.\n\nThe remainder of the public, whose political views might be more malleable, are largely tuned out of the story. Just 26 percent of non-voters say they\u2019ve been following about Mueller\u2019s investigation even somewhat closely, and only 27 percent report having at least a fairly good understanding of what the investigation has uncovered. More than half say they\u2019re not sure whether they approve of Mueller\u2019s handling of his job as special counsel.\n\nAbout the same percentage of Trump and Clinton voters said they were following news about the Russia probe \u201cvery closely,\u201d but a larger number of Trump voters (36 percent) than Clinton voters (30 percent) claimed they understood what Mueller had uncovered \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\nThe survey indicated that 73 percent of Clinton voters thought the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia was a \u201cvery serious problem,\u201d while 63 percent of Trump voters thought it was \u201cnot a problem at all.\u201d Nine out of 10 Clinton voters believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election, while 50 percent of Trump voters say Russia did not interfere in the election.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions, and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to approve the bill Thursday, sending it to the Democratic-controlled House, where it also faces favorable odds.\n\nThe White House has not yet indicated whether the president will sign the legislation. The package includes $1.4 billion in funding for a physical barrier along the southwestern border \u2014 far short of the $5.7 billion Trump previously demanded. In fact, the deal is worse for Trump than he could have had in December, when he said he would \u201cproudly\u201d shut down the government to secure more money for a wall he used to promise Mexico would pay for.\n\nBut he was blamed more than Democrats for the record-setting 35-day shutdown and may accept the deal in order to avoid further political damage. If he does, the legislation will mark a retreat for Trump not just on the wall but also in his political fight with the federal workforce.\n\nSince taking office in 2017, Trump has tried to weaken government job protections and peel back collective bargaining rights, lumping civil servants in with what he calls \u201cthe swamp.\u201d He has also periodically wielded the threat of a government pay freeze, even while boasting about a strong economy and rising wages in the private sector.\n\nAfter the Senate proposed a 1.9 percent increase last year for 2019, he sent a letter to Congress saying he wanted to nullify it. He essentially said the government couldn\u2019t afford to pay any raises, even though Republicans recently passed tax cuts expected to increase the deficit by nearly $2 trillion through 2028.\n\nEven though a majority in the House \u2014 controlled at the time by the GOP \u2014 never signed off on a pay increase, an automatic 2.1 percent increase would have gone into effect anyway on Jan. 1., because of the federal pay schedule. But Trump intervened to block it, resetting the pay hike to zero through executive order.\n\nThe government was partially shut down at the time, with roughly 800,000 workers going without paychecks. A union for federal employees said Trump was \u201cpouring salt into the wound\u201d by pre-empting a raise when so many workers were furloughed or working without pay.\n\nThe 1.9 percent increase in the spending proposal would be the largest since 2009, though still below the raises that preceded the recession.\n\nBut now it would be much tougher for Trump politically to reject a modest across-the-board hike after a damaging shutdown. By and large, Americans sympathized with federal workers who were subjected to more than a month of financial anxiety through no fault of their own. In one U.S. poll, respondents said, 50 percent to 35 percent, that Trump should have compromised to avoid the funding lapse.\n\nThe National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, an advocacy group for federal workers, called the pay increase proposed in the potential spending deal \u201clong overdue common sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis average 1.9 percent pay increase is a small, yet positive, step to ensure the federal government can recruit and retain the best of the best for the benefit of the American people,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Ken Thomas.\n\nFederal workers have faced some lean raises in recent years, compared with historical standards. Then-President Barack Obama oversaw a three-year pay freeze in the wake of the Great Recession, though he tried to end it earlier than planned but was stymied by Republicans. Federal employees can still get raises through step increases during a pay freeze, but those depend on tenure and pay grade and aren\u2019t available to everyone in a given year.\n\nThe 1.4 percent pay increase in 2018 was the largest across-the-board pay bump in eight years. Each of the four preceding years saw a 1.0 percent increase. The 1.9 percent increase in the spending proposal would be the largest since 2009, though still below the raises that preceded the recession.\n\nIf Congress passes the spending bill and Trump signs it \u2015 they have until Friday night to avoid a shutdown \u2015 federal government employees will make out much better than government contractors.\n\nWhile the former were granted backpay by Congress after the last shutdown, the latter missed out on several weeks\u2019 worth of earnings while federal offices and functions were closed. Democrats and some Republicans tried to insert a provision in the current proposal to get those workers backpay, but it became a sticking point for GOP leaders.

States and cities are taking up laws that once seemed impossible and issues that once seemed intractable.\n\nThe scale of the problem is immense. Home prices are rising twice as fast as wages. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a minimum-wage worker can\u2019t afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the country. Homes in many coastal cities now require six-digit down payments, driving up inequality and pushing poor and minority residents further from jobs and schools.\n\nBut help is on the way. In the last year, the housing crisis has become a defining political issue in cities across the country, showing up in ballot initiatives, gubernatorial campaigns and municipal debates. Nearly every candidate in the Democratic presidential primary has proposed a plan to address the housing crisis. States and cities, too, have laid out measures unthinkably ambitious just a few years ago.\n\nHere are some of the policy ideas that will define the housing crisis in 2019.\n\nATOM1Productions via Getty Images California is suing the city of Huntington Beach for building just 100 units of low-income housing since 2014.\n\n1. Hold Cities Accountable For Lack Of Housing\n\nCalifornia arguably has the worst housing crisis in the country, with a deficit of 3.5 million homes, skyrocketing rents and a spiraling homelessness crisis.\n\nThe new governor, Gavin Newsom, was elected promising to address the crisis and has already announced $1.7 billion in funding for low-income housing, homeless shelters and increased production of middle-class homes.\n\nBut the most unprecedented initiative so far was Newsom\u2019s announcement that he would penalize cities that don\u2019t build enough housing. For years, California\u2019s cities have delayed and prevented the construction of new housing units as the state\u2019s population has boomed. The result has been longer commutes, more pollution and stratospheric prices.\n\nUnder Newsom\u2019s plan, cities that don\u2019t hit the state\u2019s housing production targets would lose out on revenues from the state\u2019s gas tax. \u201cIf you\u2019re not hitting your goals,\u201d Newsom told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you get the money.\u201d\n\nSimilar efforts are underway in other states. In January, Washington state legislators introduced a bill that would require every city over 2,500 people to allow \u201caccessory dwelling units\u201d \u2014 basement apartments or backyard cottages \u2014 on every single lot. Other states have passed requirements for cities to set aside a percentage of their housing production for low-income units. California is even suing one of its own cities, Huntington Beach, for building just 100 units of low-income housing since 2014.\n\nFor decades, states have handed responsibility for housing over to cities. In the future, they may ask for it back.\n\nJohn Moore via Getty Images Police prepare to evict tenants in Atlanta.\n\n2. Prevent Evictions\n\nEvictions make every aspect of the housing crisis worse. For renters, losing an apartment means steep legal fees, long waiting lists and lost months saving up for another deposit. For cities, residents being kicked out of their homes means more families in shelters, more strain on services and more kids pulled out of school.\n\nFor the last few years, activists, lawyers and legislators have begun to advocate for a more humane approach. In Philadelphia, the Bar Association estimated last November that the city would save $45.2 million per year by spending $3.5 million on legal aid for renters. Without lawyers, tenants who were behind on their rent were evicted 78 percent of the time. With lawyers, 95 percent of renters stayed housed. Every dollar spent on legal aid, a report commissioned by the lawyers\u2019 association found, would save the city $12.74 in shelter costs, legal fees and lost productivity.\n\nSimilar efforts are being made in other cities. Minneapolis and New York are both experimenting with expanding their legal aid programs. In Seattle, the general counsels of 10 local companies (including Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft and the Seattle Mariners) signed a letter urging the governor and legislature to update Washington\u2019s eviction laws to give tenants longer notice periods for evictions and rent increases.\n\n\u201cModerate entities take positions on these things when they start getting impacted,\u201d says Xochitl Maykovich, the political director for the Washington Community Action Network, the NGO leading the effort to pass eviction reform legislation. \u201cCorporations signed this letter because they realize they can\u2019t do business in a city where no one can afford to live.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2017 Apartment List study, 27 percent of low-income renters were unable to pay their rent in the last three months and 11 percent had been threatened with eviction in the past year. These programs may begin to bring those numbers down.\n\nRoman_Makedonsky via Getty Images Duplexes and townhouses are illegal to build in many of America's major cities.\n\n3. Legalize Smaller Homes\n\nOne of the great ironies of the housing crisis is that many of the cities that need new dwellings have made it illegal to build them. Zoning restrictions, a legacy of redlining and segregation, mandate that some neighborhoods can build only detached, single-family homes. These neighborhoods make up the majority of urban land in most major cities, and their codes have rendered apartment buildings \u2014 and even duplexes and basement units \u2014 effectively illegal.\n\n2019 may be the year that finally changes. In December, Minneapolis passed the country\u2019s first comprehensive overhaul of zoning rules to allow duplexes and triplexes citywide. Last month, the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, Tina Kotek, said she was drafting a proposal that would legalize up to four homes on all urban land zoned for single-family homes. Seattle is already in the middle of a yearslong process to \u201cupzone\u201d a portion of its single-family neighborhoods.\n\nThese are the first large-scale initiatives of their kind, and their effect on housing production and prices remains to be seen. Despite the complaints of neighborhood groups organizing against them, none of these proposals would outlaw detached homes or order the demolition of any existing structures. They will simply allow developers and homeowners to split houses into two or three separate dwellings and build more densely when homes do change hands.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be some monumental change,\u201d Bruce Brunner, a Minneapolis resident, told the Star-Tribune. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to take what is already here and enhance it.\u201d\n\nChristophe Morin/IP3 via Getty Images In January, Microsoft announced a $500 million investment to help alleviate the housing crisis around Seattle.\n\n4. Companies Finally Step Up\n\nIn January, Seattle-based Microsoft announced it would invest $500 million in alleviating the city\u2019s housing crisis.\n\nThe company\u2019s effort is unique in a few ways. First, only around 5 percent of the \u201cdonation\u201d amount will actually be given away. The rest will take the form of loans targeted at increasing the production of low-income and middle-class housing. Second, the investment will target the suburbs east of Seattle rather than the city itself. Though more low-income Americans live in suburbs than in cities, affluent communities like Redmond, where Microsoft is based, have generally avoided public pressure to build low-income housing. Microsoft\u2019s high-profile initiative may finally force them to play their part.\n\nThird, Microsoft has coupled its investment with 11 political recommendations for state and local lawmakers. These include speeding up permitting processes, providing tax exemptions for low- and middle-income housing and doubling the state\u2019s Housing Trust Fund.\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t announced the exact details of the investment or the timeline on which it will be distributed. Villette Nolon, the executive director of Imagine Housing, a local nonprofit developer, said it could result in anywhere from 3,000 to 10,000 extra units of low-income housing. That\u2019s far short of the region\u2019s estimated shortfall of around 340,000 units, but it speaks to the sheer scale of the problem: Even the country\u2019s largest-ever private investment in low-income housing will only begin to turn things around.\n\nWhich is why the ultimate importance of the initiative may turn out to be Microsoft\u2019s political efforts. This is the first time a technology company has put its full weight behind policies that could begin to address the housing crisis, said Ethan Phelps-Goodman, the executive director of Tech 4 Housing, a local advocacy group.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-butterfly-center-border-barrier-restraining-order_us_5c63632de4b03de94296ae49": "The National Butterfly Center in Texas has filed for a restraining order to stop the construction of a border barrier across its land. The court action argues that the federal government\u2019s property grab violates the Constitution and will cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the environment.\n\nThe move could be the beginning of Texas clashes with the federal government over property confiscations as the Trump administration begins building border walls in the Rio Grande Valley. Some private property owners have already denied federal requests to allow access to begin surveying their land for construction sites, The Washington Post reported.\n\nFederal contractors appeared at the site unannounced in the summer of 2017 \u2014 long before funds were approved for any construction \u2014 and began ripping out trees and brush in the 100-acre butterfly refuge in Mission, refuge Executive Director Marianna Trevino-Wright told HuffPost. Construction was expected to begin sometime this month. The center attracts about 35,000 visitors annually for a chance to view about 200 species of butterflies as well as a wide range of birds in the area.\n\nAs building preparation is undertaken, \u201cDefendants\u2019 constitutional violations are escalating,\u201d the center\u2019s lawyers wrote in court papers filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \u201cImmediate injunctive relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nThe motion accuses the government of unreasonable search and seizure in taking control of the land, and seizure of property without due process of law.\n\n\u201cBy summarily depriving [the center] of its property without due process of law, Defendants defy centuries of democratic values that shield Americans from government action depriving individuals of their rightful property without notice and an opportunity to be heard,\u201d the lawyers argued.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen is named as defendant.\n\nThe butterfly center is also asking for a preliminary injunction until the government has properly assessed the environmental impact of the barrier as mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe planned 18 feet of steel bollards on top of an 18-foot concrete wall will cut off 70 acres of the refuge closest to the Rio Grande. Wildlife will be trapped on the river side during floods, while animals on the other side won\u2019t be able to get to lifesaving water. The proposed height of the barrier will also block many butterflies and birds, according to the center.\n\nThe barrier, which would be two miles from the border, would also mean that Americans who want to get from one part of America to another, for recreation along the Rio Grande, will have to go through a security system at the wall.\n\nThe planned project would clear out a 150-foot wide area along the border as an \u201cenforcement zone.\u201d Bulldozing and subsequent vehicles, noise, lights and human activity will destroy the area as a refuge for wildlife, Wright said.\n\nOther construction is slated to soon begin at two other wildlife refuges.\n\nA federal judge ruled last week that the government can begin surveying land owned by a small Texas Catholic church, which would also be cut off from the rest of America on a strip of land along the river. The local diocese has said it will battle any land confiscation by the federal government as a violation of the constitutional right of free expression of religion.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental advocacy groups late last year also sued the Trump administration over planned construction in the Rio Grande Valley, including at the National Butterfly Center, and other areas. The suit argued that the administration\u2019s decision to waive environmental regulations to speed construction was an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d power grab. The center has estimated that 93 endangered species will be further threatened by the barriers. The case is pending.\n\nFunding to build a massive barrier along 33 miles of the Rio Grande Valley was allocated by Congress last year. Money was pointedly not to be used to construct President Donald Trump\u2019s wall \u2014 only for fencing or levees. The final product, however, looks suspiciously similar to an image Trump has tweeted of a version of his imagined wall.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-fairfax-law-firm-leave-virginia-democrats-sexual-assault_us_5c61bad8e4b0eec79b26b02d": "Steve Helber/ASSOCIATED PRESS Virginia Lt.

The more recent allegation emerged on Friday, when Meredith Watson accused Fairfax of raping her when the two were classmates at Duke University in 2000.\n\nDays earlier, Vanessa Tyson, who met Fairfax at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, publicly accused Fairfax of physically coercing her into performing oral sex during an encounter that began as consensual. Tyson said she was moved to come forward when it appeared that Fairfax might replace embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D).\n\nNortham is under pressure to resign after a racist photo from his medical school yearbook page surfaced on Feb. 1. Northam initially indicated that he was in the photo, which shows a person wearing blackface next to someone wearing a Ku Klux Klan uniform. But the following day, he denied that either person in the photo was him. He has since refused to resign.\n\nFairfax has vehemently denied the sexual assault allegations against him. But after Watson made her allegation on Friday, state-level and national Democrats, many of whom had been taking a wait-and-see approach, demanded Fairfax\u2019s resignation en masse.\n\nAn attorney for Tyson has said she is prepared to testify at any impeachment proceedings against Fairfax.

Tom Suozzi said he plans to co-sponsor the Green New Deal.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) is backing the Green New Deal.\n\nOn Monday the moderate Long Island Democrat told HuffPost he plans to add his name to the nearly 70 House Democrats co-sponsoring the sweeping resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) released last Thursday.\n\n\u201cRep. Suozzi supports the Green New Deal,\u201d said Jay Bhargava, Suozzi\u2019s press secretary.\n\nSuozzi\u2019s support is notable because he occupies a seat on the influential House Committee on Ways and Means, the oldest congressional decision-making panel, with jurisdiction over taxation, international trade agreements and social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare and unemployment benefits.\n\nThe joint resolution stakes out an ambitious agenda for any Green New Deal legislation, calling for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every major sector of the economy, providing clean energy jobs to millions of Americans and vastly expanding the social safety net.\n\nSuozzi is also the vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, meaning he could help woo Republican support for a Green New Deal.\n\nIn November, when Ocasio-Cortez championed a resolution to establish a select committee in the House on a Green New Deal, Suozzi supported the effort. He called the project \u201cdaunting\u201d but said in a Facebook post, \u201cThe real question is, can we afford not to enact the Green New Deal?\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution, outlining the core tenets of what should be included in future legislation, arrived to considerable fanfare, dramatically shifting the terms of the climate policy debate away from carbon pricing schemes toward the kind of aggressive government action scientists say matches the scale of the problem.\n\nThe resolution ran into some controversy in the days that followed. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released the resolution to reporters on Wednesday night with a separate FAQ document that seemed to contradict some aspects of the resolution, including taking stances on nuclear energy and farming emissions that didn\u2019t appear in the official document. She tweeted Saturday \u201ca draft version that got uploaded + taken down,\u201d but questions remain.\n\nYet the speed with which Democrats are lining up to support the resolution anyway speaks to the crisis it aims to address. A large contingent of the New York delegation already co-sponsored the resolution, and districts like Suozzi\u2019s, which stretches along the North Shore of Long Island from Queens into Suffolk County, face catastrophic risks from sea level rise and more violent storms.\n\nIt also speaks to the popularity of the Green New Deal\u2019s stated goals. In a poll released in December, 81 percent of surveyed registered voters said they support its aims \u2014 including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans. A survey from this month found a narrow majority of voters supported raising taxes to fund a Green New Deal.\n\nIn January a majority of Democratic voters polled in New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District, which stretches along the opposite shore of Long Island from Suozzi\u2019s, said they would support a primary challenger to moderate Rep. Kathleen Rice if she did not support a Green New Deal. A spokesman for her did not immediately respond to an email asking if she would join Suozzi in backing the resolution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see so much support for the Green New Deal,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the left-wing group Justice Democrats, which has pushed the resolution. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what just a few primary challenges can accomplish for saving our economy and planet for working people in this country.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/el-paso-trump-rally-carnival-of-lies_us_5c62ed0ae4b00ba63e4ae43b": "EL PASO, Texas \u2014 As thousands of Donald Trump supporters lined up outside the El Paso County Coliseum Monday afternoon, waiting to see the president hold his first official re-election campaign rally near the U.S.-Mexico border, the MAGA merchants were in a frenzy.\n\nSome vendors pulled carts full of red or camouflage \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, yelling, \u201cTen dollars, cash or credit!\u201d Others made elaborate displays of flags for sale. The new Trump 2020 flag was popular. So was the flag with an illustration of Trump holding a gun, standing atop a tank, in front of an American flag, next to a flying bald eagle.\n\nThen there were the T-shirts: the new Trump/Pence 2020 shirt, the old \u201cHillary sucks but not like Monica\u201d shirt, and a \u201cWe are Q\u201d shirt, a reference to QAnon, the absurd and ever-evolving pro-Trump conspiracy theory that holds that the president is on the verge of destroying a pedophile ring that has been secretly running the U.S. government for years.\n\nChristopher Mathias / HuffPost Trump merchandise for sale at the rally.\n\nAs Trump supporters poured into the gated area outside the coliseum, music blared from the loudspeakers, a playlist that included Elton John\u2019s \u201cCandle in the Wind,\u201d Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cFree Bird\u201d and \u201cMemory\u201d from the Broadway musical \u201cCats.\u201d The music was interrupted intermittently by announcements, including one pleading with Trump supporters to \u201cnot hurt any protesters\u201d who might show up to ruin the night\u2019s fun.\n\nOn the giant screen outside the venue, a Trump campaign message implored fans to follow the president on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. \u201cYour source for Real News,\u201d the message screamed.\n\nHuffPost was not granted press credentials to report from inside the coliseum. Outside, an overflow crowd of some 6,000 people stood in the cold desert night to watch the screen and cheer on Trump.\n\nChristopher Mathias / HuffPost Trump\u2019s campaign implored supporters to follow the president on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nTrump\u2019s rally in El Paso was in support of his border wall. In his State of the Union address last week he claimed, falsely, that border fencing that was built south of the city in 2010 transformed El Paso from a dangerous place into a safe one.\n\nIts Republican mayor lashed out at the president last week for his falsehood. El Paso\u2019s declining crime rate started well before the border fencing was built.\n\nBut Trump repeated the lie Monday night. And for his audience, the lie was now the truth.\n\n\u201cOnce they built that wall, it was amazing how statistically the violence started going down,\u201d 39-year-old El Paso resident Michael Blanco, who owns an accounting business, told HuffPost outside the coliseum. \u201cI\u2019m a complete witness of it. Seen it growing up.\u201d\n\nHenri Rafael, a 58-year-old El Pasoan wearing a black Trump 2020 hat, said that even though the mayor corrected Trump, \u201cI know for a fact that the crime was high back in the \u201970s and \u201980s, and when they built those walls, [crime] has dropped.\u201d\n\nIn fact, violent crime increased in El Paso in the two years after the wall was built, according to a study from the El Paso Times.\n\nTrump periodically paused his speech Monday for chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d and \u201cUSA!\u201d\n\nWhen he talked of the \u201cfake news\u201d media, the crowd jeered. At one point, a particularly inspired Trump supporter attacked a BBC journalist:\n\nJust attended my first \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069 rally where my colleague BBC cameraman Rob Skeans was attacked by a Trump supporter.

Ted Cruz in last year\u2019s Senate race. O\u2019Rourke, a potential presidential candidate, held a protest a few blocks from Trump\u2019s rally Monday night.\n\nThe president taunted O\u2019Rourke from the stage, claiming that the O\u2019Rourke rally attracted a paltry few hundred attendees. El Paso police later estimated that well over 10,000 people attended.\n\nTrump spoke for over an hour \u2014 about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, about Hillary Clinton, about the Green New Deal and about how \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country.\u201d\n\nNick Martin, an investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, watched the speech and noticed someone he recognized sitting in the front row, wearing a baseball hat and an eye patch: Elmer Stewart Rhodes.\n\nRhodes is the founder of the far-right militia group the Oath Keepers. The SPLC lists the Oath Keepers as an anti-government extremist group because of the wild conspiracy theories its members promote. Rhodes recently claimed he was setting up paramilitary training camps across the U.S. to prepare to fight antifa, or anti-fascist, groups.\n\nStewart Rhodes, leader of the antigovernment group the Oath Keepers, is in the front row for Trump's rally tonight in El Paso.

There they were met by a small group of teenage protesters carrying signs reading \u201cTrump is a lying corrupt racist\u201d and \u201cAbolish I.C.E.\u201d\n\nMany Trump supporters cursed at the teens, yelling, \u201cFuck you,\u201d and started a loud chant of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d At least one Trump supporter yelled, \u201cGo back to Mexico!\u201d at the teens, most of whom were Hispanic.\n\nAnother Trump supporter ripped the \u201cAbolish I.C.E.\u201d sign from a teen\u2019s hands and ran off with it. Then another threw water at the teens\u2019 faces.\n\nLast night after the Trump rally in #ElPaso, a few teens stood outside with protest signs and chanted abt Trump being racist.

And you just kind of brush it off.\u201d\n\nShe expressed sadness over seeing so many Hispanics in the MAGA crowd. \u201cI think they\u2019re kind of close to brainwashed, if not brainwashed,\u201d she said. \u201cKind of like disappointing to see that they\u2019re supporting someone that talks down on them.\u201d\n\nA few hundred yards away, riot police announced over a megaphone that a separate group of 50 or so Trump protesters standing on a streetcorner needed to disperse. They refused. Trump supporters dipped in and out of the protest, taunting them. One shouted to the crowd that they all needed to subscribe to Pewdiepie, referring to the world\u2019s most popular YouTuber, who has promoted white supremacist content to his millions of subscribers.\n\nAntoine Williams, a 36-year-old MAGA vendor from South Carolina, stood on the sidewalk and packed up his merchandise, looking on at the mayhem. \u201cThey\u2019re askin\u2019 for it,\u201d he said of the protesters, who eventually dispersed.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ralph-northam-indentured-servants_us_5c61151ae4b0f9e1b17f0417": "Virginia Gov.

The demand that Congress include $5.7 billion to begin work on the wall led to the recent 35-day partial federal government shutdown and may trigger another.\n\nBut the El Pasoans\u2019 message, delivered at back-to-back news conferences, was an early rebuttal to the likely screed to come from Trump at a Monday evening event in solidly Democratic territory.\n\n\u201cWhat has been very frustrating to me \u2015 not just as an elected official but as a proud Pase\u00f1a, a proud fronteriza \u2015 is that this maligning of our community is used as a tool, a political tool, meant to advance a narrative that isn\u2019t true,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas). \u201cTo acknowledge the truth about this community and other border communities like us would mean to acknowledge that we are not inherently bad, we are not inherently unsafe.\u201d\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech last week, Trump claimed El Paso was one of the country\u2019s most dangerous cities until the government constructed a fence between it and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which is just across the border.\n\nThe Trump campaign followed up with a video with various unnamed El Pasoans, one of whom wore a matching \u201cMake America great again\u201d hat and shirt, saying a wall had made the city safer.\n\nIn fact, violent crime began its steady decline in El Paso in the 1990s \u2015 well before the Secure Fencing Act of 2007 funded the construction of the city\u2019s current barrier, though more modest fencing existed before that.\n\nCounty Commissioner Carlos Le\u00f3n, the city\u2019s former police chief and a three-decade law enforcement veteran, credited community policing with the gains in fighting violent crime.\n\n\u201cFor decades, El Paso has been and continues to be one of the safest cities in the country, due in large part to the work of law enforcement,\u201d Le\u00f3n said. \u201cFor the president to claim we are safe because of a wall is an insult.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation between Trump and El Paso leaders also marks former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s return to the national stage after his maverick Democratic campaign to unseat U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz ended in defeat last fall.\n\nHe told reporters on the call that he wanted to support the community groups that organized the march.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s here in an effort to use this community as a prop to make his case for the border wall,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told reporters of Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow the community\u2019s lead.... Nothing less and nothing more.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke derided the president\u2019s demand for a wall, saying that the primary result of building barriers along the border was to push people into more remote and dangerous crossings in the desert.\n\nBeyond the politics of the moment, local leaders cautioned that Trump\u2019s repeated portrayal of El Paso as a city besieged by homicidal drug-trafficking criminals would undermine local efforts to attract businesses to the region.. Escobar faulted Texas officials, including Gov. Greg Abbott (R), for planning to share the stage with him Monday night without correcting the record.\n\nEl Paso County District Attorney Jaime Esparza, who has held that position since 1993, said businesses and potential visitors had nothing to worry about, whether or not Congress elects to build more border wall.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-family-leave-democrats_us_5c61bbfce4b0eec79b26b140": "Steve Pope via Getty Images Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (above) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro plan to reintroduce the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act.\n\nThe U.S. is inching closer to a paid family leave policy this year, catching up to essentially every other country in the world.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) plan to reintroduce the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, a bill that would guarantee 12 weeks of partially paid leave for new parents and for workers who need to care for sick family members or are experiencing serious health issues.\n\n\u201cThere is very serious momentum,\u201d DeLauro told HuffPost, explaining why this year is different. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new Congress, we\u2019ve got the largest majority of women and young people.\u201d Finally, family leave is at the \u201ccenter of the debate, rather than the fringes,\u201d she added.\n\nDeLauro and Gillibrand first introduced the bill in 2013. But this year they have a Democratic majority in the House, where it\u2019s expected to pass.\n\nMeanwhile, paid leave is gaining traction with conservatives who have long opposed such efforts. President Donald Trump, pressured by his daughter Ivanka, actually proposed a paid maternity leave policy, though most advocates say it falls short in a couple of key respects.\n\nDespite the growing support for paid leave, the bill would face an extreme uphill climb in the U.S. Senate.\n\nA record 29 percent of candidates running in 2018 put paid leave policies on their platforms, up from just 4 percent in 2014, said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies at the National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s time,\u201d Shabo said. \u201cWe\u2019re the only country that doesn\u2019t provide paid leave for new moms. And one of a handful that don\u2019t provide paid time off at all for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe Family Act, as the legislation is known, would allow all workers in the U.S. to earn 66 percent of their monthly wages, up to a certain maximum, funded by a small payroll tax of two-tenths of 1 percent paid for by employers and employees. And advocates say they might tweak the bill further so that lower-income workers are able to earn a higher percentage of their pay.\n\nThe bill is modeled on similar legislation that\u2019s proved successful in a handful of states. California has been offering paid leave for more than a decade, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York also have plans in effect.\n\nContrary to initial dire warnings from conservatives, paid leave has had little to no effect on businesses in these states. In California, the vast majority of business owners said they weren\u2019t affected negatively by the bills, according to one widely cited survey. Indeed, for the few companies that already offer paid leave, the legislation would offset some of its costs.\n\nCurrently, the United States offers 12 weeks unpaid leave for some workers through the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was passed 26 years ago.\n\nCrucially, the Family Act would give paid time off to those who are sick or need to care for a sick relative. President Trump\u2019s proposal would leave those folks out.\n\nFidel Hernandez, who works in fulfillment for Amazon in Kenosha, Wisconsin, desperately needed time off to care for his sick mother last year. Maria Hernandez, 65, works for a subcontractor that provides janitorial services to Amazon. She collapsed at work because of a diabetes-related issue and needed time off to recover and heal. Fidel, who lives with his mom, wanted to help cook, clean and care for her.\n\nNeither of them could get any paid time off. Maria Hernandez took six months unpaid. Her son kept working 10-hour days. And they had trouble getting by, forced to rely on donations from a food pantry, emergency savings and some money from their local church.\n\n\u201cIt hurt me that I could not be there for my mom,\u201d Fidel Hernandez, who is deaf, said in a statement he plans to give Tuesday when Gillibrand, DeLauro and paid leave advocates reintroduce the bill. \u201cAfter working 10 hours a day, I would drive home through construction traffic and all I could think about is, \u2018Is my mom OK?

State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.\n\nWhitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson.\n\n\u201cYour inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,\u201d the acting attorney general said.\n\nRaskin was not satisfied with Whitaker\u2019s answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThis definitely bears further investigation,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWhen and where and by whom remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Jamie Raskin questions acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker at a congressional hearing on Feb. 8, 2019.\n\nThe investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLC\u2019s sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.\n\nSheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.\n\nMore recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.\n\nThe revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNow some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should \u201cwithdraw its opinion\u201d because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.\n\nBesides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senate\u2019s confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trump\u2019s choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sheldon Adelson attends a White House ceremony to see his wife, Miriam, receive the Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in November 2018.\n\nSince 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation \u2015 which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore \u2015 has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.\n\nSo Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesn\u2019t campaign on the grounds that Adelson\u2019s hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.\n\nThe Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal. But bills introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) floundered in Congress amid opposition from both parties and lobbying from those casino companies that had invested in online gaming. Adelson\u2019s lobbying group then focused on convincing the Justice Department to simply issue a new legal opinion overturning the old one.\n\nCharles Cooper, a Washington lawyer working for Adelson, lobbied the Justice Department, sending a memo in 2017 that made the legal argument for upending the 2011 opinion, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nJanuary\u2019s reversal wasn\u2019t the first big victory for Adelson under the Trump administration. Adelson is a longtime supporter of right-wing political parties in Israel and the idea of locating the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. In May 2018, he was a guest of honor at the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump decided to move it from Tel Aviv.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ocasio-cortez-pirro-green-new-deal_us_5c5fabdbe4b0910c63f127f3": "Judge Jeanine Pirro used her Saturday night Fox News show to launch a mockery-loaded rant against Rep.

Cory Booker\u2019s favorite presidential campaign-trail yarn \u2015 and he has a lot of them \u2015 is about how his parents, two of IBM\u2019s first black executives, overcame housing market discrimination to raise him and his brother in a predominantly white neighborhood in one of his state\u2019s suburbs.\n\n\n\nAs an adult, Booker likes to recall, he asked Arthur Lessman, the white lawyer who helped his parents outsmart a racist real estate agent, why the attorney was inspired to do it. It turned out that Lessman had volunteered his services after watching television one day in 1965 when the normal programming was interrupted by breaking footage of Alabama state troopers brutally bludgeoning black civil rights activists marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.\n\n\n\nRecounting the tale Friday afternoon to an audience of about 100 Democrats at a community college in Waterloo, Booker marveled at the far-reaching power of individual political sacrifices. It\u2019s a testament, he declared with excitement in his voice, to his deeply held belief that \u201clove is a radical force.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe marchers in Selma \u201cstood up for love of country and unleashed that energy and it instantaneously leapt a thousand miles and changed the heart of one man on a couch in New Jersey, who then would go on and change generations not yet born,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here right now because of that chain reaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same weekend that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to \u201cfight back\u201d against the \u201cclass warfare\u201d waged by the super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort.\n\n\n\nRather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy \u2015 an \u201cus\u201d against a proverbial \u201cthem\u201d \u2015 Booker focuses almost entirely on the \u201cus\u201d \u2015 on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement.\n\n\n\nBooker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States\u2019 forefathers \u201cimperfect geniuses\u201d for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not.\n\nI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it. Tom Swartz, former Iowa state representative, referring to Booker\n\nIn this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman\u2019s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism.\n\n\u201cIf we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,\u201d he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Booker\u2019s appeals to America\u2019s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders\u2019 work of forming a \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama\u2019s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job.\n\nOn Booker\u2019s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out \u2015 and I heard it,\u201d said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown.\n\nAfter the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren\u2019s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.)\n\nBut Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump\u2019s invective.\n\n\u201cIt probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,\u201d Blaisdell said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Charlie Neibergall Booker minged with voters at the First Congregational United Church of Christ on Friday in Mason City, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I Had To Run Something\u2019\n\nBooker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders \u2015 which includes several of his Senate colleagues. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have announced their candidacies; Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs.\n\nBooker, whose mother\u2019s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party\u2019s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cMy story is your story,\u201d he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class.\n\nBooker tells story of his Iowa roots. His ancestors moved from Alabama to mining town of Buxton; grandmother grew up in Des Moines. pic.twitter.com/lnrwamvd3V \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nMany of the Iowans who came to hear Booker speak knew him already from his dramatic, televised confrontations with Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s confirmation hearings last year.\n\nHe burnished his credentials among many Democrats when he released a memo Kavanaugh had written on racial profiling after the Republican-controlled committee refused to publicize it and barred Booker from questioning the nominee about it. On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a \u201cSpartacus moment,\u201d a reference that left observers quizzical.\n\nRegardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI had to run something,\u201d Booker said in Marshalltown. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nThe experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate.\n\nBooker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing.\n\nGrassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country\u2019s system of law enforcement and incarceration.\n\nRather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n\u201cSome people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. \u201cWell, I ran a fire department. That\u2019s not going to be a constructive strategy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/Susan Walsh Booker cajoles Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to join him in an Instagram Live post in December. Looking on is Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nShrugging Off Criticism From The Left\n\nOf course, Booker\u2019s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term \u201cWall Street\u201d \u2015 a favorite target of attack among his party\u2019s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.)\n\nIn his efforts to improve Newark\u2019s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good.\n\nBooker\u2019s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies.\n\nIn addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago.\n\nBooker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations.\n\nIn Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools.\n\nTime and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities.\n\nRather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor.\n\n\u201cI was like Malcolm X \u2014 by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,\u201d he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening.\n\nAt the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren.\n\nHe admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high. But rather than lower it to 21 percent from 35 percent, as the GOP measure did, he would have left it at 25 or 26 percent.\n\nAnd in a conversation that night about climate policy in Iowa City, he described nuclear energy as part of the solution.\n\nMore on climate change: He supports nuclear energy and thinks any climate bill must be bipartisan (unless there\u2019s a 60-vote Senate due to \u201cblue tsunami\u201d). This is at supporter\u2019s home in Iowa City. pic.twitter.com/GkkUZVa4E2 \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) February 9, 2019\n\nBooker was keen to emphasize that action on what he sees as the country\u2019s most urgent priorities \u2015 such as universal health coverage and addressing climate change \u2015 would require either compromise with Republicans or a \u201cblue tsunami\u201d big enough to grant Democrats a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.\n\nBooker is a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation, which would replace private health insurance with a federal single-payer program. But on two occasions in Iowa, he suggested that the bill is an aspiration unlikely to be realized in the near future, given the constraints of GOP numbers in the Senate.\n\nSingle-payer health care \u201cis a goal we should shoot at,\u201d he told a crowd of 500 people at Kum & Go Theater in Des Moines on Saturday.\n\nIn the interim, he proposed backing a Medicare buy-in or lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age to 55 or 50.\n\nWhat Booker did not volunteer in his discussion is that he not only opposes efforts to abolish the filibuster in the Senate, he has promised to personally defend the practice if it came under assault.\n\nStill, many of the Democrats who attended Booker\u2019s events seemed either unaware of Booker\u2019s deviations from progressive orthodoxy or relatively unbothered by it after hearing him speak.\n\nShawn Harmsen, a 46-year-old journalism professor, hosted a campaign gathering for Booker at his home in Iowa City, where he prominently displayed a blue \u201cI [heart] public educators\u201d sign on his front lawn. Harmsen wants to know more about Booker\u2019s support for charter schools, but held out the possibility that such educational alternatives might be acceptable in circumstances \u201cwhere you have minority communities who are tired of waiting for the public school system.\u201d\n\nRoberta Rosheim, a 69-year-old retired school teacher and union activist, and her husband, David, 74, a seller of rare books, went into Booker\u2019s Des Moines town hall skeptical. Roberta had read about his support for charter schools and his past receipt of pharmaceutical industry money.\n\nBut Roberta said they emerged \u201cimpressed.\u201d\n\nDavid added, \u201cI thought he came out very much for public education.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ralph-northam-resign_us_5c60456de4b0910c63f17c45": "Virginia Gov.

The agencies calculated $91 billion in damage from last year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires across the United States.\n\n\u201c2018 was an exclamation point,\u201d Arndt said.\n\nA loss of sea ice in the Arctic may be the most dramatic sign of the temperature rise. In December, NOAA\u2019s annual report on the Arctic found that the region had its second-lowest overall sea-ice coverage on record. That loss is most pronounced in the summer, but Schmidt warned Wednesday that there are \u201cdecreases in the winter as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously are very concerned about what\u2019s going on in the Arctic,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are the indisputable cause of warming, but the temperature increases seen in the past year are indicative of past decades of burning fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe still collectively have our foot on the accelerator, and while there are some indications in some parts of the world that people are working quite hard to reduce those emissions, collectively we are not doing so,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThe year-by-year changes are not that important.\u201d\n\nBut the signs are not looking good. Global carbon dioxide emissions surged for the second year in a row, hitting a record high in 2018. The United States\u2019 emissions spiked 3.4 percent last year from the year before, the second-largest annual increase in more than two decades, a report from the economic research firm Rhodium Group found in December.\n\n2018 was an exclamation point. Deke Arndt, chief of climate monitoring at NOAA\n\nThe trend is \u201cbeing driven by these greenhouse gases,\u201d Arndt said.\n\nCurrently, the Earth\u2019s average temperature is more than 1 degree Celsius, (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), above average temperatures in the late 1800s, when industrialized nations began burning huge amounts of coal and felling large areas of forest. The world is on a path to soon blow past the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement\u2019s 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, past which its predicted effects will be catastrophic.\n\nThere are some signs of hope for large-scale decarbonization. In the United States, by far the largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, a new cadre of left-wing Democrats are pushing for a Green New Deal, a national industrial plan to rapidly scale down emissions over the next decade.\n\nYet the issue remains hotly politicized in the United States. On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump, who routinely dismisses and mocks climate science, made no mention of the crisis in his State of the Union address. The Democratic response referred to climate change only in passing, but the Democratic-controlled House held two hearings on Wednesday morning to investigate global warming.\n\nRoughly 70 percent of Americans acknowledge global warming is happening, and 57 percent understand human activities are the primary cause, according to Yale University survey data. Yet the issue is only beginning to emerge as a high priority for voters. Ranking annual temperature records and extremes \u201cis part of what people are interested in,\u201d Schmidt said.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/billionaires-hatred-donald-trump_us_5c5c99e3e4b03afe8d65afff": "It\u2019s hard to admit, but President Donald Trump has triggered progress on a long-simmering issue: economic inequality.\n\nThe notion that the rich \u2015 billionaires in particular \u2015 have too much at the expense of too many has taken off in recent weeks. There\u2019s talk of \u201cbanning billionaires,\u201d and in the U.S. there are serious \u2015 and popular \u2015 policy proposals looking at how to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy, most notably from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAmericans have actually long supported raising taxes on the wealthy, surveys show. But for years, the ultra-rich, Republicans and anti-tax extremists like Grover Norquist have kept that popular sentiment at bay, partly with rhetoric about freedom and partly by philanthropic deeds, not to mention good PR to portray themselves as benevolent, self-made geniuses.\n\nNow that Trump\u2019s in office. The tide has turned.\n\n\u201cThe current occupant of the White House has rather taken the sheen off the billionaires,\u201d said Justin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s easier today to believe that a bunch of them are grifters rather than the value-creating entrepreneurs that we might hope for.\u201d\n\nJacquelyn Martin/Associated Press Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, hold up a sheet of new $1 bills on Nov. 15, 2017, at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington.\n\nIn the past, Americans wanted to tax the rich to pay for specific policies. These days, the reasoning goes that taxing the ultra-wealthy will tamp down extreme inequality, said Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing more willingness to say it\u2019s just a moral issue that someone shouldn\u2019t start out with that much of an advantage in life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe recent popularity of tax-the-rich policies isn\u2019t simply a reaction to Trump, Grossman added, but part of a natural tendency in American politics for public opinion to swing in opposition to whichever party is in power. \u201cPublic opinion moves \u2018thermostatically,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Republicans are in office and policy moves to the right, public opinion moves leftward.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s fair to say that the Democratic Party\u2019s reaction to Trump has been more extreme than it would\u2019ve been under, say, a President Jeb Bush. Trump has energized progressives on issues, like women\u2019s rights, in resistance to the president, which has inspired record numbers of women to run for office. He\u2019s also been a catalyst for environmental issues, in a way. Before Trump took office, activists and scientists had trouble getting attention for climate issues, but now it\u2019s become much easier, in part thanks to opposition to Trump, FiveThirtyEight recently reported.\n\nOf course, there are a host of other non-Trump reasons why tax-the-rich ideas are taking off now, including a rise in economic inequality that is hard to ignore and the work of economists, such as Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who\u2019ve been able to demonstrate, with hard data, how bad the situation has become.\n\nThere\u2019s also the lingering effects of the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, which pushed Democrats to the left on these issues.

Tate Reeves (R) was a member of a college fraternity that was known for pro-Confederate displays and run-ins with black students.\n\nReeves, who is running for governor in this fall\u2019s election, was in Kappa Alpha Order at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi. A 1993 yearbook lists him as a freshman that year, and he was featured as a Kappa Alpha member starting in the 1994 yearbook. The fraternity, which is still active at Millsaps, looks to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as its spiritual leader.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 1994, members of Kappa Alpha and another fraternity \u201cdonned Afro wigs and tied large Confederate flags around their necks,\u201d according to an article in The Clarion-Ledger at the time. Some of them were also reportedly in blackface. The fraternity brothers \u201cgot into a shouting match\u201d over the incident with some black students. The state fraternity leader defended the chapter, saying it was \u201cgetting a bad rap\u201d and blamed a few rogue individuals.\n\nMembers of the Black Students Association asked for the fraternity to be suspended.\n\nOne of the students leveling the charges against Kappa Alpha was Kiese Laymon, the opinions editor of the student paper. Even before the incident, in August, Laymon wrote a piece about Kappa Alpha\u2019s reputation, lumping the fraternity in with the KKK and neo-Nazis in their love of the Confederate flag.\n\n\u201cAt Millsaps, I know we\u2019ve overcome racism,\u201d Laymon wrote sarcastically in a column, \u201cand if the word \u2018nigger\u2019 is ever muttered, it could only be echoed from the walls of the Kappa Alpha house.\u201d\n\nIn response, a month later, the paper published an anonymous letter from a Kappa Alpha member who acknowledged Laymon was right about the attitudes of his fraternity \u2015 but said that, privately, not all of them were racist and sexist and did want things to change.\n\nIn 1995, the Kappa Alpha yearbook page showed a group of students standing with a Confederate flag in military attire. It\u2019s not clear if Reeves is in the photo, although he was also pictured as a member of the fraternity that year.\n\nThe images were first uncovered and published by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge on its website, the American Ledger.\n\nMillsaps College yearbook\n\nIn the 1993 yearbook, before Reeves pledged, the fraternity\u2019s page showed students in a form of blackface, mocking Pacific Islanders \u2015 with darkened faces, wearing grass skirts and leis \u2015 and wearing Confederate flag paint.\n\nMillsaps College Yearbook, 1993 In the 1993 Millsaps yearbook, there was a photo on the Kappa Alpha page featuring two students in blackface.\n\nCollege yearbooks are coming back to haunt politicians.\n\nThree of Virginia\u2019s top state officials are currently embroiled in scandals about their use or acceptance of blackface. It started with the governor\u2019s yearbook page, featuring a photo of two men, one in blackface and one in a KKK outfit. (Democrat Ralph Northam insists he isn\u2019t one of the men pictured.) Since then, the Democratic attorney general has admitted to once wearing blackface at a college party, and the GOP leader of the state Senate edited a college yearbook containing racist pictures and slurs.\n\nEven if they\u2019re not pictured in blackface, they seemed to gladly accept a privileged white culture that found entertainment in the racist pastime.\n\nIn 2013, Reeves spoke at an event for Sons of Confederate Veterans, a neo-Confederate organization that claims the Civil War was not about slavery.

He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers \u2014 including his own Secret Service detail \u2014 began their second month without a paycheck.\n\nNow, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nOne former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way he gets it done,\u201d said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump. \u201cAnd screw Puerto Rico,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cPuerto Rico doesn\u2019t have electoral votes last time I checked.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.\n\nWhile Trump has the authority to declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill \u2014 a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.\n\nOne of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. \u201cI would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,\u201d he said of the possible emergency declaration. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad law and I think it\u2019s bad strategy for the president.\u201d\n\nKeeping The Public Scared\n\nTrump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an \u201cemergency\u201d that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trump\u2019s own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.\n\nMigrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201cvery bad people.\u201d\n\nWhen the November election passed, so did Trump\u2019s interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up \u201ccaravans\u201d until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.\n\nTrump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last month\u2019s shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native \u2014 also white \u2014 has been charged in those slayings.\n\n\u201cHe continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. That\u2019s his MO. It\u2019s not new,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201cUnfortunately, it works, among some people. But it\u2019s really cynical politics.\u201d\n\nTriggering A National Emergency\n\nCynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.\n\nTrump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2015 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities,\u201d Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. \u201cNow, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.\u201d\n\nThat brought a rebuke from the city\u2019s mayor the next day. \u201cWe are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,\u201d Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC. \u201cI talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But we\u2019ve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation.\u201d\n\nPrimarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.\n\nWhile Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nDoing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a \u201cjoint resolution\u201d of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans \u2014 and could possibly lose a good deal more.\n\nSome Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m urging the president to tread carefully,\u201d said Texas Republican John Cornyn.\n\nSusan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach. \u201cI think I\u2019ve expressed serious concern about going down that path but let\u2019s wait and see what the president does before we decide,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d he told reporters late last week. \u201cWe will be looking at a national emergency, because I don\u2019t think anything is going to happen. I think the Democrats don\u2019t want border security.\u201d", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/el-paso-sheriff-trumps-dangerous-lies_us_5c5d1793e4b0a502ca341a6f": "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, El Paso, Texas, was one of the nation\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous cities\u201d before a border barrier was constructed.

Instead, he described the inquiry as an ongoing process of information-sharing between state and county officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following state law and federal law in this procedure,\u201d Whitley said, speaking at a confirmation hearing before a Texas Senate committee.\n\nBut under questioning from Democratic lawmakers, Whitley struggled to explain why, in a press release two weeks ago, his office said 95,000 noncitizens could be on the voter rolls even though that data hadn\u2019t been verified with local election officials. Whitley said he issued the press release because his office does not have investigative authority and he wanted to quickly get the data to officials who could act on it.\n\n\u201cI was confident it was the best data,\u201d Whitley said of the information he received from state officials, adding that he had received assurances it was accurate. Whitley said he did not personally review the data before it was sent out.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) is facing scrutiny over a review of suspected noncitizen voters in Texas.\n\nCounty officials are investigating the list of suspected noncitizens and have already identified substantial errors \u2015 at least 20,000 people have been removed from the list. The county officials say the secretary of state\u2019s office contacted them shortly after sending out the list and informed them the data they\u2019d sent included several people whom the state had already verified as citizens.\n\nLocal officials believe the list of suspected noncitizens may continue to shrink with more investigating, and some have said the unsubstantiated public statements about voter fraud from Whitley and state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) have undermined confidence in elections.\n\nCivil rights groups accused Whitley and Paxton of prematurely sending out unverified data and stirring up fears of voter fraud. County officials can now use that data to request that voters prove their citizenship within 30 days or be removed from the rolls. The groups say the process discriminates against naturalized citizens because the Texas Department of Public Safety does not keep updated citizenship records.\n\nSophia Lin Lakin, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project who is representing plaintiffs suing Whitley over the review, said Whitley\u2019s quick action on the list of suspected noncitizens was reckless.\n\n\u201cSecretary Whitley\u2019s irresponsible decision to forward his purge list to law enforcement authorities knowing that it very likely contained the names of naturalized citizens properly on the rolls is just another indication of the apparent disregard for the immigrant community in Texas that prompted him to initiate a purge program that by its nature threatens the voting rights of naturalized citizens,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitley refused to say his office had made mistakes in the data it sent to state officials. Instead, he said the process of verifying voters\u2019 citizenship was meant to be \u201ccollaborative,\u201d and that his office had always intended for local officials to verify the data. He said his office conducted 10 training sessions before sending out the data, and that they\u2019d warned election officials the data was likely to contain errors.\n\nTexas state Sen.

One of three federal lawsuits filed over the last two weeks to halt the voter inquiry accuses the three officials of conspiring to suppress the voting rights of people of color.\n\nDuring one remarkable exchange with state Sen.

Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R)\n\nWhitley\u2019s comments are significant because federal judges have indeed found that Texas lawmakers intentionally discriminated against voters of color \u2015 both through a voter ID law passed in 2013 and via boundaries for electoral districts. (Appeals courts have subsequently upheld revised versions of those measures.) Plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit say Texas\u2019 intentional discrimination is so pronounced that moving forward, the state should have to clear its voting changes with the federal government.\n\n\u201cSecretary Whitley\u2019s testimony today only deepened our concerns regarding the flawed and inaccurate voter purge list that his office sent to counties two weeks ago,\u201d Beth Stevens, voting rights legal director at the Texas Civil Rights Project \u2015 which is also suing Whitley \u2015 said Thursday. \u201cInstead of taking full responsibility for this debacle, he passed the buck to the previous Secretary and the Department of Public Safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost alarming for voters,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cthe Secretary admitted that he sent this list of individuals to county officials and the Attorney General before knowing all of the facts to determine voter eligibility.\u201d\n\nState Sen.

Greg Walden (R-Ore.) cited President Donald Trump\u2019s widely-criticized statements blaming poor forest management for the increasingly deadly and destructive wildfires scorching the West Coast.\n\n\u201cThe Green New Deal ignores many of these important elements of our energy strategy and it makes it difficult to meet our shared environmental goals,\u201d he said.\n\nGetty Editorial Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the leading champion of a Green New Deal, arrives for the State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\nOnce a vague term for clean-energy stimulus, the Green New Deal re-emerged in the political discourse in mid-2018. A cadre of left-wing Democratic candidates began using it to describe plans to spend trillions of dollars on a national industrial strategy to zero out fossil fuel emissions and power the country with 100 percent renewables in a decade.\n\nThe proposals electrified a static debate that too often ranged from outright denialism of climate change by some to dubious market fixes offered by others. Scientists quickly praised the idea of a Green New Deal as the first policy on the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nIn November, newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) positioned herself as the champion of the Green New Deal movement. After failing to persuade House Democratic leaders to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal, she began work on a sweeping new resolution outlining a transformative policy to guarantee high-wage clean energy jobs to millions of Americans and upgrade the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure to withstand already-unavoidable extreme weather and sea level rise.\n\nDespite years of partisan bickering over the realities of climate change, the idea proved popular. Eighty-one percent of registered voters said they supported the main goals of the Green New Deal in a poll released in December. That included 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. Last month, another poll found a narrow majority of voters said they supported a Green New Deal even if it required raising taxes to fund it.\n\nThat did little to alter the objections from conservatives at Wednesday\u2019s hearings.\n\nRich Powell, the executive director of the conservative clean energy advocacy group ClearPath, complained that the emissions projected to come from new coal-fired plants in other countries, particularly India and China, would \u201ccompletely offset\u201d the climate benefits of the U.S. completely decarbonizing.\n\n\u201cIf supporters of a Green New Deal truly believe climate change is an existential threat, they should focus on global solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nAs HuffPost reported on Tuesday, the Green New Deal resolution Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) are expected to unveil this week does just that, calling on the nation to \u201cpromote the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services with the aim to reclaim U.S. leadership on climate change to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nDuring a hearing by the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) dismissed the Green New Deal as an \u201cimpossible,\u201d \u201ctop-down\u201d proposal crafted by young, inexperienced politicians.\n\n\u201cYou only have to be 25 years old to be a member of Congress. We have young people that bring a lot of great qualities, but maybe they don\u2019t bring a lot of life experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I can understand if someone has not had a lot of life experience and they\u2019re proposing something that\u2019s extremely unrealistic \u2015 well, impossible. Impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is adults and grownups, who are older and more mature, who are also advocating something that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he added, referring to several of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nThe panel\u2019s Republican members also made a point, in a Twitter post, of deriding the Green New Deal as \u201cnot responsible policymaking.\n\nWe can all agree that these \u201cone size fits all\u201d programs like the Green New Deal, or even the Clean Power Plan, should be avoided. This is simply not responsible policymaking. \u2014 Natural Resources GOP (@NatResources) February 6, 2019\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) resorted to misrepresenting the Green New Del proposal in arguing against it. He said he and other Republicans \u201chave real concerns\u201d about shuttering military bases around the globe and cutting military spending by 50 percent \u2015 proposals floated not by any congressional Democrats in the climate change debate but by Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein in 2016.\n\nGohmert told panel witness Rev. Lennox Yearwood, president of the national, nonprofit Hip Hop Caucus, that he found it \u201cinteresting\u201d at the activist would support a Green New Deal, given Yearwood\u2019s previous service as an officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Chaplain Corps.\n\nInsisting that a Green New Deal would mean slashing military spending, Gohmert said the effect would be to leave the U.S. \u201cbasically indefensible,\u201d unable to protect itself against Russia, China or Islamic extremists.\n\nYearwood reminded Gohmert that the U.S. military has made clear that climate change looms as a threat to national security.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, the grassroots group whose protests helped propel the Green New Deal into the mainstream political debate last year, was unfazed by the Republican opposition.\n\n\u201cAny politician \u2015 Democrat or Republican \u2015 that doesn\u2019t back the Green New Deal is out of touch with what voters want,\u201d Stephen O\u2019Hanlon, a spokesman for the group, said by phone.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-green-new-deal-response_us_5c5c90cae4b0e01e32aa7ee8": "While Democratic 2020 candidates have rushed to sign on to the Green New Deal, party leaders are extending a more cautious level of support to the landmark carbon-slashing infrastructure plan.\n\nThe six-page proposal that freshman Rep.

The Republican-led state Legislature has other ideas.\n\nThe Utah Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would toss out a grassroots-driven, voter-backed ballot initiative to offer Medicaid benefits to any Utahn earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000 a year for a single person), paid for by raising the sales tax on certain goods from 4.7 percent to 4.85 percent.\n\nThe legislation instead would expand Medicaid to fewer people, enable Utah to receive less federal money for the program and impose limitations on benefits, including work requirements. And the entire plan hinges on a dubious promise of federal approval for aspects of the state Senate bill.\n\nThe Utah GOP clearly is prioritizing overturning the voters, considering the Legislature has been in session since just Monday and the bill made it out its Senate committee Tuesday and to the floor Wednesday. The fact that 53 percent of voters spoke in favor of a full Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in November is not swaying Utah Republican legislators, who have resisted the expansion since it became available in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative, known as Proposition 3, not only received majority support statewide but also in most state Senate districts, the Utah Health Policy Project reported. According to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis of the vote Wednesday, 10 Republican senators representing districts where a majority voted in favor of the expansion are supporting the bill to modify it, including the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Allen Christensen. A plurality of Utahns opposes changing the voter-backed policy, according to a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defer to the will of the people at some point,\u201d said state Rep. Brian King, the minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives and one of 16 Democrats in the 75-member lower chamber of the Utah State Legislature. \u201cWe should not be doing anything to substantively alter that Proposition 3 in a way that delays the implementation one more day.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill sends a message to voters, King said: \u201cWe don\u2019t really care what the people of the state of Utah want to do or say they want us to do at the Legislature. We\u2019re going to do what we want to do. That\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d\n\nThese actions by Utah Republican lawmakers are reminiscent of how then-Gov. Paul LePage (R) defied Maine voters last year by refusing to carry out a Medicaid expansion they approved in 2017. LePage\u2019s successor, Gov. Janet Mills (D), has already begun the process of implementing the expansion. In Idaho, where voters also passed a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, a conservative organization is challenging it before the state Supreme Court.\n\nEfforts by Republicans at the state level to undo or limit the Medicaid expansion, including the seven states that received federal approval for work requirements and the eight more seeking it, mirror the national Republican strategy on health care.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress devoted most of 2017 to attempting and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with plans that would have left millions without health coverage. And in December, a federal judge ruled in favor of 20 GOP state officials who argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in a lawsuit supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nRick Bowmer/Associated Press Tiffiny Malo, left, and Pam Harrison, supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid, at a rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law during the first day of the Utah Legislature on Monday.\n\nThe Utah Senate must vote again on the bill to significantly alter the Medicaid expansion enacted by voters, which it approved once this week against the opposition of all six Democratic senators and one of the chamber\u2019s 23 Republicans. The state House is poised to act quickly on the legislation after the Senate is finished.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving very quickly,\u201d said King, who expects the Utah House will pass the Senate bill by the end of next week.\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert has not taken a public position on the Medicaid bill. In response to questions from HuffPost, Herbert\u2019s office provided a statement from a spokesman.\n\n\u201cGov. Herbert has long supported the kind of common-sense guardrails for Medicaid expansion that are being discussed in the legislature. Many were components of his proposed Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion in 2015; most of these were part of legislation that he signed into law last general session. His primary concerns are that the state honor the will of the voters to fill the hole in the social safety net by helping those under the poverty line without health insurance and to implement without delay,\u201d Paul Edwards said in the statement.\n\nLast week, Herbert said he believed the state should allow the expansion to move forward as approved by voters and then be revisited at a later date. During his State of the State address Thursday, Herbert said only that \u201cthe much-needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay.\u201d\n\nBecause Republicans have supermajorities in the Utah House and Senate, however, the GOP would have the votes to override a veto even if Herbert decided to oppose the Medicaid legislation.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and the federal government finances at least 90 percent of the cost. This expansion was meant to be in place nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate. To date, 14 states have declined it. Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voters all approved expansion via ballot initiative last year, but the program is not yet in place in those states. Under the terms of the Utah initiative, benefits are supposed to become available April 1.\n\nThe Utah ballot initiative was straightforward in its approach by simply instructing the state to join the Medicaid expansion without any changes to the state\u2019s existing program or the need for federal approval. The Utah Governor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget assessed that the sales tax increase would raise more than enough money to finance the state\u2019s 10 percent share of the expansion\u2019s cost, although it noted that the revenue and costs in future years may not match up.\n\nBy contrast, the Utah Senate bill would trigger a complicated and uncertain process that would cover fewer people under Medicaid. The Senate began action on the measure before the Legislature\u2019s budget scorekeepers could analyze the legislation\u2019s effects, but it is designed to limit the Medicaid expansion\u2019s reach. That\u2019s despite the fact that the measure would leave the sales tax increase in place while also imposing a tax on hospitals that alone is intended to be large enough to cover the state\u2019s entire share of the expense of Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder the Senate legislation, Medicaid benefits would be available only to those with incomes below the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person. Utahns with incomes higher than that would continue to have access to subsidized private coverage via the health insurance exchange in the state. Unlike the Medicaid expansion voters approved, the state would receive about 70 percent of the funding for the partial Medicaid expansion from the federal government instead of the 90 percent offered by a full expansion.\n\nThe bill lacks detail on many key elements of the modified expansion, leaving those to the state\u2019s executive branch and federal officials to hash out. In order to maintain April 1 as the day benefits would come online, legislative Republicans are counting on all of that happening on an extraordinarily expedited basis.\n\n\u201cThis entire thing is being rammed through the Senate and the House as quickly as possible. It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters, that they\u2019re disrespecting voters by doing so,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a Washington-based organization that supported Medicaid ballot initiatives in Utah, Idaho, Maine, Montana and Nebraska over the past two years.\n\nIt is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn\u2019t be further from what voters wanted, and they\u2019re rushing it because they know that they\u2019re going against the will of voters. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project\n\nThe Herbert administration would have to resolve all the outstanding questions the bill poses and the federal government would have to approve waivers for standard Medicaid rules in less than two months, which is much more quickly than it typically acts.\n\n\u201cNothing about how the federal government moves and operates gives me much hope or assurance that you\u2019re going to get a waiver at all, much less one in a time frame that is going to be less than 60 days,\u201d King said.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty pertains to the funding. Under the legislation, Utah would ask the federal government to break precedent by providing the full 90 percent funding for a partial expansion. The Trump administration last year rejected such requests from Arkansas and Massachusetts, following the Obama administration\u2019s policy against partial expansions.\n\nUtah has even tried this before. Herbert signed legislation last year approving a partial expansion and submitted a request for approval to federal authorities. That would have covered about half as many people as a full Medicaid expansion. The state withdrew its application after the ballot initiative passed.\n\nThe new bill also calls for work requirements and for locking out enrollees who fail to meet them, but it does not specify what they would be and how they would be enforced. It also would cap enrollment for otherwise eligible Utahns if cost projections for the expansion exceed the amount of money appropriated for the year.\n\nThe attempt to overturn voters on Medicaid expansion comes a month after Herbert signed legislation to replace a medical marijuana initiative voters approved last year with a new law. In the aftermath of voters passing the marijuana and Medicaid measures, Utah lawmakers also are eying changes to the ballot initiative process to let the Legislature alter voter-backed policies before they take effect.\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from a spokesman for Utah Gov.

Greg Abbott, Secretary of State David Whitley and Attorney General Ken Paxton \u2015 and seeks damages if a judge finds that their alleged conspiracy violates the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought on behalf of several Texas voters and three organizations that run voter registration projects, is the latest in a string of legal challenges seeking to overturn a controversial voter probe that Republican leaders cite as evidence of voter fraud, but critics deride as a thinly veiled attempt to suppress the vote of naturalized citizens, who are overwhelmingly of Latin American or Asian birth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear as the purge effort has unraveled over the course of a week and the state officials have refused to withdraw the purge list that their real intentions are not related to maintaining the integrity of the voter rolls,\u201d MALDEF attorney Nina Perales told HuffPost, \u201cbut instead are to take eligible voters off the rolls and intimidate naturalized citizens from voting.\u201d\n\nGetty Editorial Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had called the list evidence of serious voter fraud.\n\nThe MALDEF lawsuit also alleges that the state\u2019s Republican leadership violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause and two Voting Rights Act provisions \u2015 one that bars officials from imposing different voter registration standards for different groups and another that prohibits them from racial discrimination.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Whitley announced that his office had identified some 95,000 suspected noncitizen voters, including 58,000 who had cast a ballot over the last two decades, by checking voter registrations against Department of Public Safety records. The secretary of state then distributed the list to county voter registrars, asking them to send letters verifying those voters\u2019 citizenship by sending a letter asking them to provide proof. Those who fail to respond in 30 days would be scrubbed from the rolls.\n\nPaxton, the attorney general, trumpeted the news the same Friday it was released, calling it evidence of voter fraud. Abbott echoed the sentiment and called for the state Legislature to enact stricter requirements for Texans to register to vote. The issue gained national attention on Sunday when President Donald Trump repeated the claims of voter fraud from his Twitter account, stating them as fact.\n\nBut the list generated by the secretary of state did not provide evidence of a single case of voter fraud, let alone a broad trend involving nearly 100,000 people. DPS, the agency that issues driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, doesn\u2019t keep up-to-date citizenship records, leaving open the possibility that people who obtained a driver\u2019s license before naturalizing as U.S. citizens and registering to vote would get flagged by the state\u2019s probe.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what has happened. Over the course of the week, the secretary of state\u2019s office itself contacted county officials to tell them to disregard tens of thousands of names that state officials had determined within days were actually citizens. The flaws in the process weren\u2019t limited to flagging citizens who naturalized after taking out a state ID \u2015 Harris County, which encompasses Houston, struck some 400 duplicates off its list.\n\nDemocrats characterize the crackdown on suspected noncitizen voting as an attempt to suppress the vote after a midterm election that saw Hispanic turnout skyrocket. Democratic members of the state Legislature, along with more than a dozen civil rights groups, have demanded that Abbott rescind the probe, without success.\n\nIt\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority of people on this list are citizens eligible to vote. Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center\n\nSome 78 percent of those flagged in the secretary of state\u2019s list live in counties that voted Democratic in the 2018 U.S. Senate election.\n\nLegal challenges have been quick to mount. The League of United Latin American Citizens, a Hispanic civic group, sued to block the voter probe Tuesday, alleging that it amounted to voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based nonprofit, joined the LULAC lawsuit Friday, filing an amended class action complaint to the earlier lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Antonio on behalf of Julie Hilberg, a 54-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in the United Kingdom.\n\nHilberg, who lives south of San Antonio in Atascosa County, registered to vote in 2015 and cast her first ballot in the following year\u2019s presidential election. She found that she was on the voter probe list after asking the county registrar, according to CLC attorney Paul Smith.\n\n\u201cThis program is a gratuitous attack on people\u2019s right to vote that has no factual basis,\u201d Smith told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority of people on this list are citizens eligible to vote, but they\u2019re going to get this notice saying they have 30 days to prove their citizenship. It\u2019s inevitable that some of them won\u2019t and they\u2019ll get purged.\u201d\n\nThe amended complaint filed on Hilberg\u2019s behalf Friday also accuses Whitley and Paxton of violating her First Amendment right to the vote as a form of self expression and 14th Amendment right to cast a ballot freely, calling the voter probe an \u201cunconstitutional voter purge.\u201d\n\nPaxton said he welcomed the opportunity to defend the probe after he was first sued on Tuesday. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the amended complaint.\n\nEven as the Republican-led probe unraveled, Abbott praised his administration\u2019s efforts, describing the crackdown launched by the secretary of state\u2019s office as a \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\nRepublican state legislators have also filed bills in both chambers that would codify the flawed process for identifying suspected noncitizen voters and require the secretary of state\u2019s office to perform the checks annually.\n\nBut any process requiring the state to use state driving agency records to verify voter registrations would also surely invite a federal lawsuit, according to Smith.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shutdown-state-of-the-union_us_5c5a4711e4b00187b55612d4": "The longest government shutdown in history happened on Donald Trump\u2019s watch. But the president made no mention of it in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.\n\nThe partial government shutdown lasted 35 days, affecting about 800,000 federal workers \u2015 in addition to thousands of federal contractors. Government employees missed two paychecks, with many wondering how they would pay for essentials like food, medicine and housing. They looked for new jobs, turned to relatives and friends for temporary loans and went to food pantries.\n\nThe shutdown occurred because Trump insisted that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the country\u2019s southern border, even though he once promised that Mexico would pay for that barrier. Democrats refused to go along with his demand and said he should simply fund the government and argue about immigration later. He refused.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump caved and signed a bill funding the government for three weeks. He has insisted that if he doesn\u2019t get his money for a wall by Feb. 15, he may declare a national emergency allowing him to build it anyway.\n\nTrump never mentioned what federal workers went through during his speech Tuesday night. He expressed no remorse for the shutdown, and he didn\u2019t promise that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. The closest he came to referencing the shutdown was in urging Congress to fund the border wall when passing legislation to fund the government beyond Feb. 15.\n\n\u201cCongress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland and secure our southern border,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers and human traffickers out of business.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s State of the Union address was affected by the shutdown. It was supposed to occur on Jan. 29, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) canceled it \u2015 she has that power since the president delivers it in the Capitol \u2015 and said they would discuss a new date only after the government reopened.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach is a break from what President Bill Clinton did in 1996, after what had previously been the longest shutdown ever. In his State of the Union speech that year, Clinton honored a heroic public servant who had been furloughed because of the shutdown. He then warned Congress to remember the pain of the shutdown when legislating in the future.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s address Tuesday night, Stacey Abrams \u2015 who ran for governor of Georgia \u2015 did address the shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-wall-national-emergency_us_5c53660be4b01d3c1f11c320": "Evan Vucci/ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump speaks in McAllen, Texas, during a tour of the U.S. border with Mexico on Jan. 10, 2019. Sen. Ted Cruz listens.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 One week into the three-week negotiating period before another possible government shutdown, President Donald Trump yet again demanded that lawmakers give him billions of dollars for a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nHe also hinted that he would declare a national emergency if they did not.\n\nAll while simultaneously claiming \u2015 falsely \u2015 that he has already built and is currently building \u201ca lot\u201d of the wall.\n\nSo went the latest twists Thursday in Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to get U.S. taxpayers to provide the money for a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall that he promised hundreds of times during his campaign he would force Mexico to pay for.\n\n\u201cThere is no wall going up,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential primaries. \u201cSo the only thing to conclude is that Trump is building a fake wall with fake pesos to stop fake caravans to prevent a fake border crisis for which he will declare another fake victory.\u201d\n\nThe president triggered a 35-day government shutdown just before Christmas over the refusal by the then wholly Republican-led Congress to appropriate billions of taxpayer dollars for his signature campaign promise.\n\nA week ago, he signed the exact short-term spending deal \u2015 with no wall money \u2015 that he said he would not sign in December. On Thursday, he said he did so to help the 800,000 federal workers who already had missed a month of pay. He claimed, without evidence, that \u201cmany\u201d of them had wanted him to continue the shutdown to get wall money.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to do it because people were getting hurt,\u201d Trump told reporters following an Oval Office photo opportunity.\n\nHe added that the shutdown had great value because it focused attention on the wall and illegal immigration. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do the shutdown, people wouldn\u2019t know, people wouldn\u2019t understand the subject,\u201d the president said. \u201cNow they understand the subject. They understand what a humanitarian crisis it is.\u201d\n\nThe fact of the matter was it\u2019s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants. A former Trump campaign official, on the president's criticism of the former House speaker\n\nTrump has taken to blaming former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan for failing to get him funds for a wall during Trump\u2019s first two years in the White House, when his own party controlled both chambers of Congress. \u201cI was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed,\u201d he told the conservative website Daily Caller.\n\nBut one former Trump campaign official said the president failed to take advantage of his first-year power when he had it. \u201cThe fact of the matter was it\u2019s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nNow, with the House under the control of Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is facing vocal opposition to his wall rather than just passive resistance. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday, but allowed that she is open to some new barriers in some areas as well as money for better technical monitoring. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nTrump made illegal immigration and caravans of asylum-seekers heading to the border the centerpiece of his midterm election message last year. In speech after speech, he told audiences at his rallies and those watching at home that the migrants would bring crime and drugs and that Pelosi wanted \u201copen borders\u201d and would welcome those people in.\n\nDespite his efforts \u2015 and in some congressional districts, because of them \u2015 Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House. Meanwhile, Republicans, although they had the most favorable Senate election map in decades, picked up only two seats in that chamber.\n\nAs a Dec. 21 government funding deadline approached, Trump resumed talking about caravans and immigrants coming to commit crimes \u2015 including one particularly lurid but apparently apocryphal description of kidnapped women being bound and gagged with duct tape as they\u2019re smuggled across the border.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters that he doubted the House and Senate conference committee negotiators working on a new Department of Homeland Security funding bill would include money for his wall. He acknowledged that he might yet declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d which he believes would let him transfer money from other executive agency accounts to build the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting till Feb. 15,\u201d Trump said, referring to the next shutdown deadline. \u201cOn Feb. 15, the committee will come back. And if they don\u2019t have a wall, I don\u2019t even want to waste my time reading what they have.\u201d\n\nMedia reports from when Trump previously threatened to declare an emergency noted that he was thinking of raiding billions of dollars from the Defense Department\u2019s Army Corps of Engineers budget to repair hurricane damage in places like Puerto Rico and Houston.\n\n\u201cThose are not great ideas,\u201d said Michael Steel, once a top aide to then GOP House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nSteel added that since Democrats seem willing to agree to money for some new physical barriers, he did not fully understand talk about an emergency or another shutdown.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-syria-afghanistan-senate_us_5c5342d4e4b0bdf0e7d9383d": "WASHINGTON \u2015 A big bipartisan majority in the Senate bucked President Donald Trump over his foreign policy in the Middle East on Thursday, expressing their symbolic opposition to Trump\u2019s plans for a quick withdrawal of U.S. troops from their yearslong fight against terrorism abroad.\n\nTrump\u2019s planned drawdown in Afghanistan and total withdrawal from Syria triggered a backlash from the U.S. national security establishment earlier this month, including the resignation of top officials like former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. The surprise troop announcements also alarmed Republicans on Capitol Hill, who managed to convince Trump to delay the pullout of 2,000 troops from Syria for several months to ensure a slow and orderly withdrawal.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted 68-23 to advance an amendment offered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a key Trump ally, that expressed the sense of the chamber that the U.S. \u201cfaces continuing threats from terrorist groups operating in Syria and Afghanistan\u201d and that the \u201cprecipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.\u201d\n\nWhile the amendment is a nonbinding provision without the force of law, it sent a clear message to the White House that any plans to immediately pull troops out of war zones could jeopardize the fight against groups like the so-called Islamic State, leave Kurdish allies on the ground defenseless, and embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran.\n\nWhether to withdraw from the conflicts could become a big issue in the coming Democratic presidential primary, however. Many likely or declared candidates have struggled to voice a clear position on Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves in the Middle East.\n\nThe vote to advance McConnell\u2019s amendment took place just a day after Trump called the heads of his own intelligence agencies \u201cnaive\u201d on Twitter for contradicting him about the threats North Korea and the Islamic State pose to the U.S. The tweet came after Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel testified on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Intelligence should go back to school,\u201d Trump said in the tweet on Wednesday, which is only the latest example of him ridiculing and refusing to take advice from his own top national security advisers.\n\nTrump\u2019s public broadsides against the intelligence community \u2015 which follows his denials about the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessments regarding the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 presidential election \u2015 irked GOP leadership in the Senate this week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you can say this but I prefer the president would stay off Twitter \u2014 particularly with regard to these important national security issues,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nLast year, a big bipartisan majority of senators similarly rebuked the Trump administration over its support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets criticizing intelligence officials also alarmed Democratic leadership in the House and Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence leaders this week urging them to stage an \u201cintervention\u201d with Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, said it was \u201ccourageous\u201d that intelligence officials \u201cspoke truth to power. \u201d"}
