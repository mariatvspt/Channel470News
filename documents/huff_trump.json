{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-election-fraud-evidence_n_5c6ae122e4b01757c36e79ae": "The executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections revealed Monday that state officials had uncovered a \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d effort to collect absentee ballots on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate in the November election.\n\nKim Strach, the board\u2019s executive director, made the comments at a closely watched public evidentiary hearing in Raleigh on Monday following a monthslong investigation into election irregularities in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The state board declined to certify the race last November and could order a new election after the hearing. Republican Mark Harris currently leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the race.\n\nIn the first public comments outlining the results of the state\u2019s probe, Strach said investigators had evidence that McCrae Dowless, a political operative working on behalf of the Harris campaign, filled out and mailed in incomplete or blank ballots from both his office and home. She said Dowless paid people in cash to collect requests for absentee ballots and the ballots themselves. The state board also has evidence, she said, that Dowless paid people to falsify signatures on absentee ballots indicating that they had witnessed those ballots being filled out (North Carolina requires two witnesses to someone filling out an absentee ballot).\n\nIt is not illegal to help someone request an absentee ballot in North Carolina, but it is illegal for anyone other than a close relative to take custody of the actual ballot.\n\nStrach said Dowless took several steps to conceal the fraud. Those measures included using the same color ink as the voter who filled out other parts of the ballot, mailing the ballot from a post office close to the voter and placing the stamps on the envelopes in a certain way not to raise red flags.\n\nPaid To Collect Absentee Ballots\n\nThe first witness at the hearing \u2015 Lisa Britt, a Dowless employee \u2015 testified that she was paid to go out and help voters ask for absentee ballots and to collect the absentee ballots themselves. Britt, whose mother was married to Dowless decades ago, said she received $150 to $175 for every 50 request forms she turned in. She said she was initially paid about $125 for every 50 absentee ballots she turned in, but later that was turned into a weekly fee because it was more difficult to get people to hand over their absentee ballots.\n\nBritt said Dowless never told her to not take custody of the ballots.\n\nShe also accused Dowless of trying to obstruct the investigation into irregularities and even attempting to influence her testimony before the board. She said that after the election, he had told his workers that if they stuck together, nothing would happen because officials didn\u2019t have evidence of wrongdoing. According to Britt, Dowless instructed her last Thursday to testify on Monday that neither she nor Dowless had done anything wrong and to plead her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nIn her testimony, Britt confirmed what Strach said as well. She said she herself had collected between 35 and 40 absentee ballots, about half of which had been properly witnessed. She said she didn\u2019t mark anyone\u2019s ballot to indicate a vote for Harris, but on unsealed ballots, she did fill out downballot races for Republicans. She said she did this so that election officials wouldn\u2019t get suspicious as to why there were so many races left blank and because Dowless was working on behalf of Republicans.\n\nAccording to Britt, Dowless instructed her to mail only nine or 10 absentee ballots at a time from a post office close to where the voters lived. Mailing more could raise suspicions.\n\nShe said she had accidentally placed a stamp upside down on an absentee ballot and Dowless had told her not to do that because that too could raise red flags with election officials.\n\nWhen Marc Elias, a lawyer for McCready, pressed Britt as to why she never questioned Dowless about the underlying purpose behind all these steps, she said it was because he was like a father figure to her and she trusted that he wouldn\u2019t ask her to do anything illegal.\n\nBritt said that she now believed she had engaged in wrongdoing, but that she didn\u2019t know at the time what she was doing was wrong. Dowless, she said, had done things wrong as well.\n\nShe also said she did not believe that Harris knew anything about the absentee ballot scheme.\n\nCynthia Singletary, an attorney representing Dowless, told reporters in Raleigh on Monday that he had not tried to obstruct testimony.\n\nAsked To Falsely Sign As Voter\u2019s Witness\n\nThe second witness called by the state board on Monday was Kelly Hendrix, who also worked for Dowless. She said she got to know him when he gave her rides to her job at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nHendrix said that Dowless asked her to sign as a witness on absentee ballots that she personally had not collected.\n\nJust as the first day of the hearing was coming to a close, the board called Dowless as a witness. But Singletary, his lawyer, said her client would decline to testify unless the board ordered him to do so.\n\nAfter the board went into a brief closed session, board member Robert Cordle said a state statute required Dowless to be given immunity if he was ordered to testify \u2015 something the board was unwilling to do. Instead, Cordle asked him to testify voluntarily and said they would assume \u201cnegative inferences\u201d if he did not. Singletary said again that Dowless would not testify.\n\n\u201cMy client would love to testify under the right conditions,\u201d Singletary told reporters after the hearing.\n\nWhat About The Ballots Never Mailed In?\n\nRepublicans have called on the state board to certify Harris as the winner of the congressional race if the board does not have evidence that the alleged illegal activity could have swayed the outcome of the election.\n\nIn her opening remarks on Monday, Strach said the state board was looking not only at absentee ballots that were mailed in but at the unusually high number of absentee ballots that voters requested but didn\u2019t return to election officials in two counties in the 9th District. She said that over 2,000 absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties went unreturned.\n\nStrach said that Harris had hired Dowless through a third party, Red Dome Group, and paid him $131,375 between July 2017 and November 2018.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will unveil a major new initiative on Tuesday designed to make sure every family can afford high-quality child care, according to several people who have heard about the proposal or seen material describing it in the past week.\n\nThe plan seeks to make access to child care universal, the sources told HuffPost, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale.\n\nNo family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing.\n\nOnly providers that meet federal safety, staffing and curriculum standards could qualify for the funding.\n\nOfficials with Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment on the proposal and the sources familiar with the plan cautioned that some details were still in flux as of last week.\n\nBut, the sources said, the campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. That is a net figure, taking into account higher economic benefits of early childhood investments, such as making it easier for new parents to return to work.\n\nIf that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren\u2019s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs, which include Head Start, a block grant for state-level child care programs, and a tax credit that mostly benefits middle-class families.\n\nTo offset the cost of the initiative, the sources said, Warren will propose using revenue from her proposal for a new tax on wealth.\n\nA Focus On Affordability \u2015 And Quality\n\nThe goal of capping costs at 7 percent of income doesn\u2019t come out of thin air: That\u2019s the figure the Department of Health and Human Services uses to officially define \u201caffordable\u201d child care. But these days, care costs a lot more than that for large numbers of families across the country.\n\nAs of 2017, married couples paid an average of 11 percent of their household income on child care, while single parents paid 37 percent, according to the research and advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America. And that figure masked enormous variation, depending on the community and type of care.\n\nIn Mississippi, for example, care for one infant at an accredited center costs about $5,300 a year, which works out to about 7 percent of median income for a married couple there. But in California, that care costs an average of $16,000 a year, which is 18.6 percent of the median income for married couples.\n\nAnd the figures are dramatically higher for single-parent families, because their incomes are so much lower.\n\nHelping families pay for child care isn\u2019t Warren\u2019s only goal. She also wants to do something about the inconsistent and frequently low quality of care options available.\n\nIn the new proposal, the sources said, Warren will call for requiring child care providers that receive federal funds meet standards similar to those that now apply to the Head Start program or the U.S. military\u2019s child care system, which early childhood experts have long praised. Those standards include things like more rigorous training requirements for caregivers and more frequent safety inspections.\n\nThe initiative would also require qualifying child care centers to pay caregivers salaries that are competitive with what public school teachers in their communities make. That would be a dramatic shift, given the notoriously low wages child care workers currently make.\n\nLast year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that more than half of child care workers had, over a two-year period, relied on at least one federal assistance program for low-income people. Boosting their pay is part of Warren\u2019s effort to boost child care quality, because it would allow providers to attract and retain more qualified workers.\n\nOf course, that also makes the whole initiative more expensive.\n\nPutting Child Care On The Political Agenda\n\nChild care has rarely gotten serious attention in American politics. One of the exceptions was during World War II, when the federal government had to arrange for \u2015 and finance \u2015 care of children whose mothers were working in factories.\n\nSubsequent research found that the initiative, known as the Lanham Act, had beneficial effects that lasted for many years. Kids who were in the program were less likely to drop out of high school, for example. But lawmakers let the measure lapse after the war ended.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as traditional gender roles started to break down and more women moved into the workplace, Congress took up child care again and actually passed major legislation that looked quite a bit like what Warren is proposing now. Then-President Richard Nixon, following the advice of conservative advisers, vetoed the legislation and said it was anti-family.\n\nThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign. a source who has seen the Warren plan\n\nThe issue mostly disappeared from the political agenda after that, until a few years ago when President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued a series of high-profile reports on work-family and early childhood issues, and started including major child care proposals in his annual budgets.\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called for major new child care initiatives \u2015 and Clinton, who had a long history of advocacy on the issue, indicated that she intended to give it high priority if elected. But these proposals got little media attention and there were no signs they got the attention of voters, either.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) put together a major new bill called the Child Care for Working Families Act, which has similar goals to Warren\u2019s proposal but differs in the policy particulars. Murray and Scott have said they intend to introduce an updated version of their legislation this year.\n\nBut these kinds of child care initiatives are unlikely to become law anytime soon, given Republican control of the Senate and the White House and the GOP\u2019s skepticism of large-scale government spending programs. The first chance to pass major child care legislation would probably be 2021, if Democrats win the White House \u2015 which means the attention Democratic candidates could determine what priority, if any, it is given in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact that somebody is coming out of the blocks and talking about it in such a big way, it\u2019s a really important sign,\u201d said one person who had seen the Warren plan.\n\nA proposal like Warren\u2019s would likely face serious political opposition, in part because of its scale. But Warren has spoken frequently about her difficulty finding child care as a working parent, suggesting she considers the issue worth trying to push as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe cycled through one child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near panic \u2015 every time it represented a failure,\u201d Warren said during a speech before the National Women\u2019s Law Center in 2017. A few months later, she was a key player on a bipartisan agreement to increase federal funding for early childhood programs by $2.8 billion.\n\nWarren is by no means the only declared or prospective Democratic presidential candidate who has shown an interest in these issues.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in particular has a long record of proposing and endorsing policies that would help working parents, including proposals to reduce child care expenses, while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is a longtime advocate for expanding a child-based tax credit.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has frequently touted his signature accomplishment, the city\u2019s new pre-kindergarten program, as a model for the nation.\n\nOne source suggested that with Warren\u2019s plan on the table, other 2020 candidates are more likely to introduce major proposals of their own. Creating an \u201carms race in child care,\u201d said one source, \u201cwould be a big accomplishment.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-sue-trump-national-emergency-wall_n_5c6b53a6e4b0e8eb46b8fb7d": "Sixteen states joined together to file a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

Tony Evers (D) has announced a proposal that would legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize possession of small amounts in his state, falling in line with a campaign promise that advocates say would reduce opioid use and inmate populations.\n\n\u201cAs a cancer survivor, I know the side effects of a major illness can make everyday tasks a struggle,\u201d Evers, who survived esophageal cancer, said at a news conference on Monday. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be treated like criminals for accessing medicine that could change or maybe even save their lives.\u201d\n\nEvers\u2019 proposal, which will require approval from the state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature, follows overwhelming support from voters back in November to legalize marijuana.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers announced a proposal on Monday that would legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize possession of small amounts in his state.\n\nEvers\u2019 predecessor and campaign opponent, Scott Walker, had said he would not support legalizing marijuana, which he called a gateway drug. Based on the results of last year\u2019s ballot measures, some political observers have suggested that Walker\u2019s aversion to legalizing it in any form cost him his re-election bid.\n\nMore than 30 states have already legalized medical marijuana.\n\nEvers\u2019 proposal would legalize the drug only for medical use and would require a recommendation by a physician, or a practitioner under the direction of a physician. He also wants to legalize cannabidiol, also known as CBD oil, and expunge criminal records for those who have completed their sentence or probation for possession. Possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana would also be decriminalized.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about access to health care, this is about connecting the dots between racial disparities and economic inequity,\u201d Evers said. \u201cWisconsin has the highest incarceration rate in the country for black men, and drug-related offenses account for a significant proportion of those inmate populations. The bottom line is that we\u2019re spending too much money prosecuting and incarcerating people and often people of color for nonviolent crimes related to possessing small amounts of marijuana.\u201d\n\nWisconsin has the highest incarceration rate in the country for Black men, and drug-related offenses make up as much as 75-85% of inmate populations.\n\n\n\nBy decriminalizing marijuana, we\u2019ll begin to address racial disparities and cycles of poverty in communities across our state. \u2014 Governor Tony Evers (@GovEvers) February 18, 2019\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make our state any safer or stronger, and in the end, it hurts our kids and our families and our communities in the long run,\u201d he added.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has also advocated for legalizing medical marijuana as an alternative to prescribing opioids to combat pain.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of an opioid epidemic and when people are facing pain issues \u2014 I would much rather have a doctor prescribing medical marijuana than an opioid,\u201d he told local station WTMJ-TV last month. Kaul also suggested that the legalization could become a \u201cgood source of revenue for the state.\u201d\n\nThis doesn't make our state any safer or stronger, and in the end, it hurts our kids and our families and our communities in the long run. Wisconsin Gov.

The Venezuelan opposition, along with the U.S., European Union, and some governments in Latin America, refused to accept the result as legitimate.\n\nSupport for Maduro has eroded since 2014 amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, which has led to spiraling inflation and food, water and medical shortages, according to human rights observers. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn February, the White House toughened sanctions on members of the Maduro government and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in an effort to further strangle the country\u2019s economy and break the will of Maduro and his supporters.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened: Maduro has held onto power, with much of the military\u2019s top brass maintaining their support. That has fueled concerns among Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters and officials in countries like Colombia and Brazil who assumed there was \u201ca more developed strategy\u201d for toppling Maduro, Bloomberg reported. In the U.S., former officials told The Wall Street Journal that the White House and its advisers thought bringing down Maduro would be \u201ca 24-hour operation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech, and his decision to turn Venezuela and socialism into an early campaign issue, came against that backdrop, and he directly threatened members of the Venezuelan military on Monday, urging them to abandon Maduro or else.\n\n\u201cThere are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are risking their future, they are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven before the speech, Venezuela experts had worried that the administration\u2019s increasingly political calls for Maduro\u2019s ouster might only bolster his position and undermine attempts to address Venezuela\u2019s ongoing political and humanitarian crises.\n\n\u201cThe more the U.S. makes this about Trump versus Maduro, the more that plays into Maduro\u2019s hands,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cIt makes it easier for him to paint himself as a victim of imperialist menace.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already lacks credibility in a region where it has a long history of backing efforts to oust political leaders it dislikes, including in Venezuela, where the Bush administration was linked to a 2002 effort to conduct a coup against Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMaduro has denied that Venezuela is suffering food shortages or undergoing any semblance of a humanitarian crisis, despite doctors reporting children dying from malnutrition and widely shared images of empty shelves at grocery stores. He has also reportedly used special police forces to crack down on protests and dissent.\n\nBut pro-government protests have also occurred, and Maduro and his supporters have painted Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-declared legitimacy, and the U.S. backing of him, as little more than another attempted coup.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions have played into Maduro\u2019s hands, said Temir Porras Poncele\u00f3n, a former adviser to Ch\u00e1vez who is now a critic of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very public regime change strategy,\u201d Porras, who is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris, said. \u201cThe involvement of the U.S. administration makes it easier for the Maduro government to depict it as a U.S.-led plan to achieve regime change in Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t make things easier. It doesn\u2019t solve the political problem.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump appointed Elliott Abrams as the White House\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela. A veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, Abrams backed efforts to overthrow multiple governments and has been linked to cover-ups of human rights violations and potential war crimes in Latin America during the 1980s, at the height of the U.S. governments efforts to prevent the rise of leftist governments in the region. Abrams reportedly backed the 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, though he has denied those claims.\n\nThe United States last week used military aircraft to deliver what it described as humanitarian aid to Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, even as Maduro promised he would block its entry into the country.\n\nThe aid package, though, appears to be little more than a propaganda effort from a U.S. government that has historically used the cover of humanitarian assistance to bolster regime change efforts in Latin America.\n\nThe U.S. government ignored urgings from the United Nations and International Red Cross that the attempted delivery risked \u201cpoliticizing\u201d vital aid those organizations and other countries with stronger diplomatic ties to Venezuela were already delivering, and the U.S. quickly turned Maduro\u2019s refusal into a convenient photo opportunity: On Feb. 6, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a picture of a supposedly-blockaded bridge between Colombia and Venezuela to draw attention to Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept aid.\n\nThe Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The U.S. & other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela\u2019s military under Maduro's orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE. #EstamosUnidosVE pic.twitter.com/L4ysYJaM6H \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) February 6, 2019\n\nThe bridge in the photo, however, has been closed closed since construction on it completed in 2016, and has never been used by those fleeing Venezuela or international groups delivering aid to the country.\n\nTrump reiterated Monday that Maduro should allow the aid to enter Venezuela.\n\nBut aid delivery has \u201cbeen done quietly and under the radar,\u201d Ramsey said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s really important that any aid efforts are coordinated with these actors who are already on the ground.\u201d\n\nEven some who support the administration\u2019s actions on Venezuela have acknowledged that Trump has \u201czero credibility when it comes to human rights concerns,\u201d and Trump\u2019s governance of his own nation has also undermined his purported cause in Venezuela.\n\nMaduro blasted Trump as a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d in an interview with the BBC last week, adding that the White House is ruled by the Ku Klux Klan. National Security Adviser John Bolton was also roundly criticized Monday when he praised Colombia for accepting Venezuelan refugees at a time when Trump has attempted to close the U.S. borders to refugees and immigrants, especially those from Latin America.\n\nThe obvious reaction to this - ironic that the US would ask other countries to give refuge to Venezuelans when its own refugee policy has been so restrictive - is yet another example of how the Trump admin\u2019s immigration policies conflict w its stated foreign policy priorities https://t.co/u2Ug8z8aaV \u2014 Yeganeh Torbati (@yjtorbati) February 18, 2019\n\nTrump discussed Venezuela with Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque during a White House meeting last week, and Maduro has said he would meet with Abrams or other Trump officials. But even as Trump intensified his rhetoric against Maduro on Monday, his administration has found itself somewhat isolated in its approach to Venezuela on some fronts.\n\nThe Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American democracies and Canada that also backed Guaid\u00f3, has said it would not support any military intervention in Venezuela, an option that experts see as unlikely but that the Trump administration, by contrast, has refused to take off the table. Top Trump allies in the region, like right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have said military use is not acceptable.\n\nIn early February, meanwhile, a collection of eight European Union nations and three Latin American countries \u2015 all of whom have stronger diplomatic ties with Maduro\u2019s government than the U.S. \u2015 began talks to \u201cforge a common international approach to support a peaceful, political, democratic and Venezuelan-owned resolution to the crisis ... through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not a part of the group, largely due to its lack of historical credibility in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the United States government cannot be a member of this contact group,\u201d the Washington Office for Latin America said last week, \u201cbecause the U.S. government lacks the positioning to lead a negotiated solution.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s continued escalation, though, could threaten any ongoing talks, said Porras, who has warned that U.S. involvement carries substantial risks, including the potential for civil war.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-bureaucratic-coup-trump_n_5c6a69c7e4b033a79943feaa": "Sen.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is a powerful and ambitious statement. It\u2019s more than just a delineation of the enormous changes that will be required to stave off the most cataclysmic impacts of climate warming. It offers a portrait of the better world we can create by doing so.\n\nIt also has no chance of becoming law, not while Republicans control the Senate and climate change denier Donald Trump resides in the White House.\n\nMarkey and Ocasio-Cortez know this. That\u2019s why the Green New Deal is framed as a joint resolution, not a formal law, meaning even if it passed, the measure wouldn\u2019t bind the government to any new policies. This distinction is key to understanding what the Green New Deal is \u2014 and is not \u2014 and how to usefully talk about it now. It is a major statement of the Democratic Party\u2019s political priorities. It is not a detailed blueprint of how to get there \u2014 or how to pay for it.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda, however, is clear: Dramatic action must be taken to avert a climate disaster that will otherwise render much of the world uninhabitable. This is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nInstead of extreme weather disasters, famines and wars over natural resources, the Green New Deal envisions a future in which our nation overcomes its addiction to oil, gas and coal. The federal government would need so many workers to deploy renewable energy, retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient and construct more durable infrastructure that it could guarantee a job to every American who wants one. Those jobs would pay well and offer union protections. And because climate change touches on every facet of life, the transition away from fossil fuels would happen alongside a rapid expansion of safeguards for Americans already suffering the ill effects of dirty energy, from poisoned waterways to the coal industry\u2019s monopolistic domination of entire regional economies.\n\nOne priority the Green New Deal does not include? Balancing the federal budget. Neither the Green New Deal legislation nor an FAQ released by Ocasio-Cortez last week included a detailed set of plans about how to pay for it.\n\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images California suffered another record wildfire year in 2018.\n\nThis is as it should be. Anyone who cares deeply about balancing the budget can find a welcoming political home in the arms of billionaire Howard Schultz. Legislation should be crafted to solve social problems. The financial details affiliated with solving those problems are just that \u2015 details \u2015 which can be developed as political circumstances warrant. There is plenty of time between now and 2021 to sort them out.\n\nThis was the approach taken during the original New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw fighting the Depression and the Nazi war machine as emergencies that required immediate action. Roosevelt himself liked balanced budgets as much as the next fellow. He raised taxes on the rich repeatedly \u2015 the top rate rose as high as 94 percent during the war. But he didn\u2019t let a balanced budget get in the way of progress. If he couldn\u2019t get enough money from taxes, Roosevelt borrowed it, fighting both the Depression and World War II with enormous federal debts.\n\nAnd yet among contemporary thinkers, the Green New Deal\u2019s very clear statement of priorities has prompted furious controversy. Noah Smith intones that Ocasio-Cortez is calling for \u201cunlimited deficit spending\u201d that will march America into \u201coblivion.\u201d Steven Rattner accuses Green New Deal advocates of \u201cintergenerational theft.\u201d Marc Thiessen declares that Ocasio-Cortez has proffered \u201cthe neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing.\u201d Even Paul Krugman is warning against putting forward ambitious new government programs without levying new taxes.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez and Markey haven\u2019t advocated for any of these things. They simply haven\u2019t detailed their tax and debt agendas in this particular piece of symbolic legislation.\n\nNot that Ocasio-Cortez has a problem with tax hikes. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she has proposed a 70 percent marginal income tax rate for the highest-income American households. There is quite a bit of competition in the 2020 Democratic primary field among different programs to tax the rich \u2015 robust new wealth taxes and estate taxes to go alongside higher income taxes. There seems little risk that supporters of these popular tax hikes will suddenly sour on them once they find out they are not included in the Green New Deal\u2019s first piece of legislative text.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s useful to keep these tax and climate discussions separate, at least for the moment. Doing so sets up taxing the rich as an end in itself \u2015 something that should be done for the sake of democratic fairness and accountability, rather than a mere source of funding. According to new research from University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, in today\u2019s America \u201cwealth concentration has returned to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties.\u201d Billionaires not only can purchase politicians; they can buy their way out of social accountability. Inequality is its own pressing problem.\n\nIt is also very likely that even taxing the living daylights out of the rich won\u2019t generate enough money to fund a climate program that gets the job done. And that\u2019s fine. The government runs deficits all the time.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2019s agenda is clear: Climate change is an emergency that deserves immediate attention. Millions of lives are quite literally at stake.\n\nSome of this faux controversy over the Green New Deal comes down to a feud within the economics profession over the rising prominence of a school of thought known as modern monetary theory. MMT began getting a hearing in Washington when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hired economist and MMT proponent Stephanie Kelton as an adviser ahead of his 2016 presidential run. Ocasio-Cortez has created more buzz for the doctrine by talking it up in interviews with journalists.\n\nMMT is essentially a revival of a tradition of Keynesian economics going back to, well, John Maynard Keynes \u2015 the name is a reference to \u201cmodern money\u201d in Keynes\u2019 1930 book, A Treatise on Money. According to MMT economists, taxes are not really a method of raising revenue for the federal government. The government, they note, raises revenue for itself by printing money. Taxes, instead, are a regulatory tool \u2015 a way to manage inflation, economic inequality and production incentives. MMT doesn\u2019t say the government can or should implement multitrillion-dollar proposals without raising any taxes. It just offers a different rationale for taxes, their uses and their limits.\n\nThe window for avoiding climate catastrophe is closing fast. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a world just half a degree hotter on average than today\u2019s will lead to at least $54 trillion in damages. That level of warming is all but guaranteed unless world governments not only halt but cut in half surging global emissions and begin removing carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere over the next decade.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-mccabe-trump-russia-putin_n_5c6a0de4e4b033a79943bd2b": "Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe \ufeffmade a series of startling allegations during a sweeping interview with \u201960 Minutes\u2019 that aired Sunday, including claims that President Donald Trump\ufeff took advice from Russian President Vladimir Putin over the counsel of his own intelligence chiefs.\n\nSpeaking with host Scott Pelley, McCabe, who was fired last March just two days before his retirement, alleged that Trump regularly launched into unprompted diatribes about his fondness for Russia.\n\nIn one instance, McCabe claimed, Trump said he didn\u2019t believe North Korea had the capability to launch a missile at the United States because Putin had told him so.

Trump rescinded those protections upon taking office but their status remains in limbo due to pending court cases.\n\n\u201cCongress has the power to address this move by the president, and we must use it. As President Obama said himself in 2013, he is not an emperor; his job is to execute laws that are passed, not write his own. Congress must hold him accountable,\u201d Jordan said in a statement in 2014.\n\nThe comparison between Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and his predecessor\u2019s executive action on immigration is not perfect; Trump is claiming authority via the National Emergencies Act of 1976, a legally dubious move in itself. But the case does illustrate the willingness of some Republicans to cheer on a president as he attempts to circumvent Congress \u2015 as long as it\u2019s for a priority they support.\n\nDuring a separate interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) expressed concern about the consequences of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration setting a precedent for future Democratic administrations. But the Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman, who once called Obama\u2019s actions on immigration \u201cunconstitutional overreach,\u201d did not voice a similar objection to Trump\u2019s attempt to unilaterally secure funds for his border wall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly the expansion of authority Congress has given past presidents, this president has the same authority. I wish he wouldn\u2019t use it in this case. But again, I understand his frustration,\u201d Johnson said Sunday.\n\nWhile six previous presidents collectively declared dozens of national emergencies, Trump\u2019s declaration over a border wall would be the first to finance a project that Congress explicitly refused to pay for.\n\nTrump on Friday signed a spending bill into law that allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 a fraction of the president\u2019s $5.7 billion demand for more than 200 miles of concrete or steel barriers. He said he would obtain an additional $8 billion in part by redirecting billions that Congress approved for Department of Defense military construction projects.\n\nDemocrats hammered the announcement as \u201cunlawful\u201d and vowed to quickly challenge it in the courts. A number of Republicans also expressed concern about a future Democratic president moving to circumvent Congress on gun violence and climate change.\n\n\u201cWe have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a statement, arguing that Trump\u2019s move would enable a future president to use the same tactic to implement the Green New Deal, a Democratic-backed economic and environmental initiative.\n\nTrump\u2019s emergency declaration is likely to face a vote of disapproval in both the House and Senate, potentially setting up his first veto as president. It\u2019s not clear, however, whether there is enough support among Republicans to override him.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adam-schiff-trump-russia-collusion_n_5c697e4de4b05c889d20258e": "House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) insisted Sunday there is no question that evidence points to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign colluding with Russia, despite what his Republican counterparts in the Senate say.\n\n\u201cYou can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence,\u201d the congressman said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d However, he noted, \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Senate intelligence committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told CBS News his panel had discovered nothing to indicate collusion had occurred, though Schiff has stood firmly against that conclusion.\n\nSchiff cited the 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which Donald Trump Jr. was promised dirt from Russians on then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as Trump\u2019s soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition.\n\nDemocrat @RepAdamSchiff : \u201cYou can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence.

She took many lessons from those episodes, but one of the biggest was that threatening the insurance of people with good employer benefits is a terrible idea, no matter how appealing the new alternative sounds.\n\n\u201cThere are 160 million people who get their insurance through their employer,\u201d DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, told HuffPost recently. \u201cYou cannot tell them overnight that it is gone.\u201d\n\nLots of Democrats are making similar argument these days as proposals to create a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system get serious attention and scrutiny. The proposal getting the most attention right now comes from Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who made \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. House Democrats are working on a version of their own. Progressive supporters say the approach offers the most efficient way to make sure everybody can get affordable medical care \u2015 plus, they note, it would mean ending private insurance hassles once and for all.\n\nBut enrolling everybody into a government-run insurance plan would also mean wiping away employer-sponsored coverage, and the available polling, consistent with DeLauro\u2019s viewpoint, suggests the public would be wary. That is one reason even some Democrats who endorsed \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in the past are balking at committing to it now, while others are pushing explicitly to start much more slowly \u2015 perhaps by taking one of the two big existing programs, Medicare or Medicaid, and opening them up to carefully targeted groups of people. An example is a new bill from several Democratic senators that would let people older than 50 buy into Medicare.\n\nDeLauro, whose district includes some of the most liberal-leaning parts of New Haven, has bigger plans in mind. Along with another House Democrat, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, DeLauro has put together a proposal that envisions more dramatic reforms than those limited Medicare or Medicaid expansion proposals would launch, even though it would stop short of the kind of immediate, wholesale transformation that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would unleash.\n\nAlex Brandon/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) wants to create a government-run program open to everybody while allowing employers to keep offering benefits if they choose.\n\nThe legislation, which DeLauro and Schakowsky are calling \u201cMedicare for America,\u201d would create a comprehensive, government-run insurance program that would replace the big existing federal programs as well as the private insurance policies that people today buy on their own. But large employers would get to keep offering private coverage, leaving employees with the choice of sticking with their company plans or moving to the new public option, where they could potentially get much lower premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLike any health care initiative, the DeLauro-Schakowsky bill would entail real and complicated trade-offs. A skeptical take on the proposal is that it\u2019s just ambitious enough to carry the same political liabilities as something like the Sanders bill but not ambitious enough to carry its strengths. \u201cMedicare for America\u201d envisions less sweeping changes than \u201cMedicare for all\u201d does, but that could mean leaving in place more of the current system's waste and complexities.\n\nA more optimistic read on the \u201cMedicare for America\u201d bill is that it could create a stable, well-functioning universal coverage scheme \u2015 one that, with maybe a few adjustments, would offer Americans the kind of financial protection and convenience that many European systems do. The possibility might be enough to make the proposal an attractive landing spot for those Democrats who crave bold action but have qualms about \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\nSome Major Disruption, But Mostly For Half The Population\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d resembles some more skeletal proposals that have been in circulation for the past year or so \u2015 from analyst and Shadowproof contributor Jon Walker, Yale University political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Center for American Progress (CAP). Those last two are not coincidental: DeLauro and Schakowsky worked with Hacker and CAP experts as they crafted the bill, which the lawmakers introduced in December.\n\nThe CAP role might rankle those progressives who consider the think-tank too timid or protective of the Democratic Party establishment. But Walker is well-known on social media for his sharp progressive posts, while Hacker is famous for his role developing, and then fighting for, a strong public option in the Affordable Care Act. All of them have long records of supporting government-run insurance, as do DeLauro and Schakowsky.\n\nThat political pedigree may explain why, for all the talk about minimizing disruption, \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would actually disrupt quite a lot. For starters, it would automatically enroll everybody who does not have employer-sponsored insurance into the newly constructed government program. That\u2019s basically half the U.S. population, including people on Medicaid or Medicare as well as those who currently buy coverage on their own, whether directly from insurers or through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges.\n\nBryan Bedder via Getty Images Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker, who fought for a public option in the Affordable Care Act, advised the lawmakers writing the new \"Medicare for America\" bill.\n\nTransferring all of those people into a new government program is no small matter and something that proponents of major health care reforms (on the political right as well as the left) frequently overlook. Medicaid, in particular, has evolved considerably in its 50 years, as lawmakers have tacked on provisions in order to address the very specific needs of the program\u2019s vulnerable populations, including the disabled and the elderly. A proposal that simply dumped these groups into a regular insurance program could easily leave them struggling to pay for care and support.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d doesn\u2019t appear to have that problem. DeLauro and Schakowsky worked closely with representatives of the disability community, who now praise the bill for its attention to their needs and its potential to improve access to care rather than diminish it. They cite, among other things, the high standard of support for people who use home- and community-based services (everything from help with bathing to job counseling) in order to live independently and stay out of institutions.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first bill that considers long-term supports and services when it thinks about universal health care,\u201d Nicole Jorwic, director of rights policy at The Arc, an organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, told HuffPost.\n\nA Big Role For Private Insurance\n\nAs for the basic medical coverage, \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would provide an insurance package that looks a lot like what the Affordable Care Act is supposed to provide, except that benefits would come directly from the government and would be considerably more generous. The difference is particularly stark for people making up to twice the poverty line, or about $50,000 in annual income for a family of four, because they would pay virtually nothing.\n\nAbove that income threshold, premiums and out-of-pocket expenses would gradually become more substantial. And although they would still compare favorably with the standard policies available through the Affordable Care Act, this is where the really big differences between the DeLauro-Schakowsky and Sanders approaches start to emerge.\n\nIn the kind of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system that Sanders envisions, nobody would pay premiums and nobody would pay out-of-pocket costs, except for some token extra charges for people who buy brand-name drugs when cheaper, equivalent generics were available. This is a point of principle for progressives who think the financial burden of health care spending should be a collective responsibility exclusively (taxes finance the system) and who fear, with good reason, that high out-of-pocket spending penalizes the poor and sick.\n\nKaren Ducey via Getty Images Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) is putting together a new version of \"Medicare for all,\" a single-payer bill, and hopes to introduce it in the next few weeks.\n\nAnother conspicuous difference between \u201cMedicare for America\u201d and \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is the role of private insurance. \u201cMedicare for America\u201d would not only allow employers to keep offering private plans. It would also allow private insurers to keep offering so-called Medicare Advantage plans that roughly one-third of seniors now use instead of traditional Medicare \u2015 and it would allow insurers to offer those plans to non-seniors as well.\n\nProponents of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d think that allowing private insurers to maintain this foothold preserves some of the worst parts of today\u2019s health care system, in part because it means doctors and hospitals must still deal with multiple payers of services. One of the clearest benefits of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is that it would vastly simplify billing, allowing hospitals to cut administrative staff and ultimately save the system money.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d wouldn\u2019t do that, at least to the same degree. Nor would it sever completely the attachment between employment and coverage: As long as some businesses kept offering plans, employers would have some role in employee benefits. Plus, there are a lot of data to suggest that government overpays insurers that provide Medicare Advantage plans, allowing them to make extra profits at taxpayer expense.\n\nKeeping the private insurance industry in the driver\u2019s seat is simply too hazardous for our health care. Adam Gaffney, Physicians for a National Health Plan\n\n\u201cThe shenanigans and gaming of wasteful privatized Medicare plans have drained the public purse for decades,\u201d Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Plan, told HuffPost. \u201cThe excess administrative costs, and profits, imposed by our fragmented system produce hundreds of billions of dollars in waste. And patients are ill-served by narrow networks of providers, and by copays and deductibles, all of which would be retained under this plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeping the private insurance industry in the driver\u2019s seat is simply too hazardous for our health care,\u201d Gaffney said.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d supporters, by contrast, figure that most private plans from employers and through Medicare Advantage provide decent coverage \u2015 good enough, at least, that the political cost of forcing people to give up those plans isn\u2019t worth the potential upside. The key, they say, is using automatic enrollment at the workplace to make sure everybody really gets insurance, holding private plans to high standards, scrutinizing those Medicare Advantage plans more carefully and then making sure everybody has the opportunity to move into the public alternative \u2015 where premiums and out-of-pockets could end up being a lot lower because of the sliding income scale.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who collaborated with DeLauro on the \"Medicare for America\" bill, is a longtime advocate of government-run insurance.\n\nThis does not amount to a guarantee that people will get their current plans, as Obama infamously promised about the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s more like a vow to make sure everybody has access to coverage at least as good as most employer plans today \u2015 with an openly stated hope that a well-performing public plan would either force private insurers to keep up or force them to abandon the business.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who is frustrated with their private insurance, this plan would provide an immediate off-ramp,\u201d said Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at CAP. \u201cThe 150 million workers with employer coverage can move over at their own pace, whether they\u2019re fed up with their private insurance right now or prefer to wait until the Medicare plan is proven to work well. ... In other words, private insurance would no longer be a necessity.\u201d\n\nAs Charles Gaba, the Michigan-based analyst who runs ACAsignups.net, put it recently, the goal of \u201cMedicare for America\u201d is to make the new government program \u201cmandatory for roughly half the country (those least likely to object) but completely optional for the other half (those most likely to object).\u201d\n\nGovernment Control Of Prices, In A Roundabout Way\n\nA key ingredient in other nations\u2019 successful health care systems, which reformers in this country frequently cite as models, is government control of budgets and prices. That\u2019s why all of those countries are able to cover everybody with so much less money than the U.S. devotes to heath care.\n\n\u201cMedicare for America\u201d proposes to fix this by, in effect, setting a loose upper limit on doctor and hospital charges while allowing the government to negotiate drug and medical device prices. It\u2019s similar to the approach that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would take, but it would be less direct and less aggressive.\n\nWhere the Sanders proposal envisions paying hospitals at current Medicare rates, for example, the DeLauro-Schakowsky bill would establish a payment baseline that\u2019s 10 percent higher than Medicare\u2019s. That would still be less than commercial coverage, and the result would put some pressure on hospitals to lower prices, but not as much pressure as a proposal like the Sanders bill would apply.\n\nWithout that pressure, guaranteeing comprehensive benefits for so many people who don\u2019t have them would cost even more money. Exactly how much money is hard to say right now, and that is one reason it\u2019s difficult to predict with any confidence how many \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d the plan would produce.\n\nIf the DeLauro-Schakowsky proposal gets serious attention, influential groups, such as unions, will watch closely to see what it would mean for their members, many of whom have employer benefits more generous than what \u201cMedicare for America\u201d as presently written would guarantee. Groups representing the elderly citizens will be equally vigilant, checking to see how the new coverage and costs would compare to what seniors see once they are on Medicare.\n\nBut those questions don\u2019t need answers right away. With the new congressional session just starting, the presidential campaign still in its embryonic phase and opportunities to pass laws almost certainly two years away at least, bills and campaign proposals seem important primarily as markers politicians can use to signal their priorities and stake out early negotiating positions.\n\nFor anyone who is frustrated with their private insurance, this plan would provide an immediate off-ramp.

CNN\u2019s Laura Jarrett reported that his replacement could be announced as early as this week.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to the DOJ for comment.\n\nReports that Rosenstein\u2019s departure was imminent first appeared in January. He initially planned to leave shortly after Trump\u2019s pick to become the next attorney general, William Barr, was confirmed by the Senate, ensuring he\u2019d stick around to aid in a smooth transition.\n\nBarr was confirmed in a 54-45 vote last week, mostly along party lines, and will succeed Jeff Sessions. He is expected to tap Jeffrey Rosen, who currently serves as the deputy transportation secretary, as his deputy at the Justice Department. That position will require its own Senate confirmation vote.\n\nBarr will assume control over special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing inquiry into Russian meddling in the presidential campaign, but lawmakers have already expressed worry about his impartiality due to his views on presidential power.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Barr wrote a 19-page memo criticizing the opinion that Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI Director James Comey amounted to obstruction of justice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming pretty clear that the president is basing his choices for leadership at the Justice Department on candidates\u2019 criticism of the Mueller investigation,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) wrote on Twitter at the time.\n\nTrump has long been critical of Rosenstein\u2019s tenure at the DOJ following Sessions\u2019 recusal over any matter at the agency related to the Russia probe. The deputy attorney general appointed Mueller in May 2017, giving the special counsel broad authority to investigate Russian interference but also \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\u201d\n\nSuch a wide purview has already swept up many members within Trump\u2019s orbit, including the president\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his former personal attorney Michael Cohen and his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, among others.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-oliver-donald-trump-interview_n_5c681a1ae4b033a799431618": "John Oliver thinks President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cvacuous nonsense\u201d has forced comedians to cover his administration in a totally different way.\n\nIn a new interview with Newsweek, the host of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d said \u201cthe job of comedy is to take something substantial and kind of break it down into comedy.\u201d\n\nBut with Trump, comedians have \u201cto go through a different system where you\u2019re trying to inject meaning into something that he said that\u2019s objectively meaningless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s so much vacuous nonsense that you feel like he\u2019s just chumming the water with bullshit.

A former top Drug Enforcement Administration official who helped hunt him down said a wall on the border with Mexico wouldn\u2019t do much to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S.\n\nA former top Drug Enforcement Administration official who helped hunt down Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman said President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall wouldn\u2019t do much to stop the flow of deadly substances into the country.\n\nWith most major drug loads coming through ports of entry rather than isolated parts of the border, former DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley said the government should be focusing on better manpower and screening at official channels.\n\n\u201cIt is far too risky and expensive for any of the cartels to move high-volume drugs through those desolate, really unwalled areas,\u201d Riley told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m a little confused as to why our guy in the White House really doesn\u2019t understand that. ... On the drug side, we know that nearly 80 percent of all the drugs we\u2019re dealing with \u2015 coke, heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl and marijuana \u2015 they come through existing ports of entry.\u201d\n\nTrump, in declaring a national emergency on Friday in an attempt to reroute billions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund his border wall, dismissed the views of drug trafficking experts who say that most drugs coming over the border come through ports of entry.\n\n\u201cA big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads don\u2019t go through ports of entry,\u201d Trump said at a White House press conference after declaring the emergency. \u201cThey can\u2019t go through ports of entry.\u201d He called it a lie that drugs are mostly coming through the ports of entry.\n\nBut Riley, who was the target of an assassination plot by El Chapo\u2019s crew, said that \u201cvery little\u201d drug trafficking takes place outside ports of entry and that more manpower and technology at those entry points would be much more efficient. Fewer than a third of vehicles coming through ports of entry are thoroughly searched, Riley said, and it was part of El Chapo\u2019s business model to use expressways and ports of entry because those are the \u201cmost economical way\u201d to get shipments across the border.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re El Chapo Guzman and you\u2019re sitting in Sinaloa, you\u2019re thinking \u2018Hell, that\u2019s damn near a 70 percent chance. I\u2019m going to get seven of those 10 cars through.\u2019 It\u2019s like they say, you only had to bat .300 to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame,\u201d Riley said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Jack Riley (left) in Chicago at the announcement of Guzman as the city's public enemy No. 1 in February 2013. A former top DEA official, he recently told HuffPost that focusing on ports of entry to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S. would be much more efficient than a border wall.\n\nSlightly more than half the drugs by weight seized by U.S. Border Patrol agents last year were discovered outside legal ports of entry, according to preliminary Customs and Border Protection data for last year. But marijuana, which is legal in several U.S. states, accounted for 95 percent of the haul. As for the more serious drugs that have raised concern amid the opioid epidemic, the vast majority of seized shipments last year \u2014 including 90 percent of the heroin and 80 percent of fentanyl \u2014 were found at ports of entry.\n\nRiley is out with a new book, Drug Warrior: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo and the Rise of America\u2019s Opioid Crisis, which recounts his career at the DEA from his days as an undercover officer in Chicago to his time as the agency\u2019s No. 2 official. It also focuses on his work catching El Chapo, who was recently convicted on federal charges that will send him to prison for life.\n\nRiley said he fears that Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Mexico is damaging the relationship between U.S. law enforcement officials and their counterparts across the border.\n\n\u201cWe would have never been able to capture El Chapo twice without the help of the [Mexican] marines,\u201d Riley said, referring to El Chapo\u2019s initial 2014 capture and recapture after his 2015 escape from a Mexican jail cell. \u201cThat was a trust-building situation that took years to do, and unfortunately with one condescending tweet, you can affect the relationships that guys worked so hard to build. I\u2019m fearful that that\u2019s what\u2019s occurring.\u201d\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s plan would pull $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities. The plan doesn\u2019t directly affect the DEA\u2019s budget, but Riley said the agency is \u201cresource starved\u201d and operating with far fewer agents than it needs to execute its mission.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Feb. 15 in an attempt to reroute billions of federal funds to his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He dismissed the views of drug trafficking experts who say most drugs come into the country through ports of entry.\n\nDespite the title of his book, Riley said that the opioid crisis has shifted his thinking on the best ways to combat drug problems in the United States and that terms like \u201cwar on drugs\u201d are inappropriate, if only because wars typically end.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have told you this 20 years ago: We can\u2019t arrest our way out of this. We\u2019ve got to have a balanced approach, with universal treatment available for people who need it and want it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be dealing with addiction, cartels and violence for the rest of our existence. It\u2019s just how we choose to attack it.\u201d\n\nRiley said that he has big concerns about the \u201ccozy relationship\u201d between big pharma and members of Congress and that the DEA had to \u201csettle for a civil fine\u201d instead of pursuing criminal cases time and time again.\n\n\u201cA lot of that had to do with the influence of Congress on the Department of Justice,\u201d he said. But fining big pharmaceutical companies a few million dollars was just the \u201ccost of doing business\u201d for them, he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s like taking a truckload of narco-dollars from El Chapo. It has no effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I wish we would do is go after some of the executives criminally, where appropriate, and put them in jail, and that would send a signal throughout the industry that we\u2019re serious,\u201d Riley added. \u201cMillionaire executives in custom suits, they\u2019re not going to do too well playing kickball on the prison yard with some real felons. It will change the industry.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anderson-cooper-donald-trump-emergency-constitution_n_5c666964e4b01757c36a117a": "CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Thursday explained why President Donald Trump has \u201cturned his back\u201d on the Constitution with his plan to declare a national emergency to secure funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nThe host of \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d shared Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which states that \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d He then explained that Trump, who wants to use the possible declaration to circumvent the need to obtain funding from Congress, had \u201cjust made his own political difficulties over the border and the budget into a national emergency.\u201d\n\nCooper also highlighted this old Trump tweet about former President Barack Obama:\n\nRepubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress. \u2014 Donald J.

Instead, he decided to force a costly government shutdown over his proposed wall that angered just about everybody while producing no extra money for his priority.\n\nThe government funding bill that Congress is expected to send to the president\u2019s desk on Thursday provides just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 approximately the same amount of money for barriers that Congress offered the president late last year. A Senate committee approved even more for border security \u2015 $1.6 billion \u2015 in a bipartisan agreement last summer.\n\nBut Trump bet he could extract a lot more, as much as $5.7 billion, from the newly elected Democratic majority in the House by partially closing down the government and daring them not to blink and agree to fund a wall he initially said Mexico would pay for. Heeding calls from conservative media personalities like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter \u2015 his pseudo kitchen Cabinet \u2015 Trump refused to accept a deal that even Republicans had agreed to, thereby forcing 800,000 federal workers to go without pay in a shutdown that cost the economy $11 billion.\n\n\u201cThis White House, supposedly the best dealmakers on earth, really dropped the ball. I mean, we had a chance here to solve this problem two months ago without a shutdown,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is now planning to declare a national emergency to obtain the remaining funds to build the wall, the White House said. But that legally dubious option isn\u2019t likely to net him more miles of border barrier either.\n\nLast year, the president actually might have obtained as much as $25 billion to build his wall. The Senate considered legislation in February 2018 that would have funded the wall\u2019s construction in exchange for permanent protections for those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, providing a path to citizenship for some 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Dubbed the \u201cCommon Sense\u201d compromise, the bill seemed like the most viable way forward with some rare areas of bipartisan agreement.\n\nBut Senate Republicans, even those who were sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers, came out in opposition to the bill after the White House issued a veto threat and began whipping members to vote against it. The Senate bill failed to reach a filibuster-proof majority on a 54-45 vote, despite near-unanimous Democratic support.\n\nTrump attempted to revive a form of that deal in January, offering temporary protections for DACA recipients in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding. Democrats refused, however, maintaining that three years of deportation relief for Dreamers, who remain in legal limbo since Trump rescinded their protections, wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy during the shutdown angered members of his own party as well. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) got into a heated confrontation with a fellow GOP senator during a weekly lunch last month as frustration reached a boiling point and poll after poll showed the American public blaming Trump and congressional Republicans over Democrats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the shutdown was a good idea. I think it was just all about point scoring. But a lot of people got hurt unnecessarily,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost this week, when asked if he felt that the shutdown had been worth the trouble. He lamented that Democrats seemed to be focused on \u201ctrying to embarrass\u201d Trump by opposing barriers on the border.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said they hoped the bitter monthslong fight over border security, with no additional funding to show for it, had taught Trump not to use the tactic again.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-obama-tweet-national-emergency_n_5c65f3e8e4b033a79940c986": "The Twitter blowback over President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to declare a national emergency to build his border wall has zeroed in on Trump\u2019s own past tweet bashing then-President Barack Obama for \u201csubverting\u201d the Constitution with an executive action because he was \u201cunable to negotiate with Congress.\u201d\n\nTrump wrote that post in 2014 after Obama announced executive actions to crack down on illegal immigration at the border while offering temporary legal status to more undocumented migrants already in the U.S.\n\nRepubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress. \u2014 Donald J.

The national emergency declaration gives Trump a chance to reroute other government money to fund the project \u2015 and sets up a legal battle that could tie up the president\u2019s signature project for months or years.\n\nTo justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.\n\n\u201cWe have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. There were roughly 520,000 arrests for unauthorized border crossings last year, which is about one-third of the 1.6 million arrests that happened in 2000. Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum.\n\nThe total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone. That will buy the administration some 234 miles of border wall, a senior administration official told reporters Friday.\n\nThe national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nThe Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture account.\n\nNone of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said.\n\nThe DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed. Those restrictions won\u2019t apply to the portions built with national emergency money, a senior administration official said.\n\nIt's not as if he just didn\u2019t get what he wanted so he's waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision. Congress passed a government funding bill Thursday evening.\n\nMcConnell warned Trump in private that declaring an emergency would spark a backlash among Republicans, according to The Washington Post.\n\nA national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis. In this case, Trump is sidestepping Congress so that he can gain access to certain federal funds without congressional approval.\n\nAdministration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by \u201cunlocking\u201d new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if he just didn\u2019t get what he wanted so he\u2019s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nThe move is almost certain to be challenged in court.\n\n\u201cAny crisis on our border is of President Trump\u2019s own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more. There is no national emergency,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement. \u201cIf Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won\u2019t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nFor two months, Democrats in Congress have been enmeshed in stalled negotiations with Trump as he refused to accept anything less than $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his border wall. The stalemate caused a record-breaking partial government shutdown that forced an estimated 800,000 government employees to go without pay for 35 days.\n\nTrump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ann-coulter-mariah-carey_n_5c66eebde4b01757c36b3a67": "People think President Donald Trump displayed some true diva behavior while declaring a national emergency to build his border wall Friday \u2014 particularly when it came to Ann Coulter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d Trump told reporters of the far-right talking head who spoke at his rallies.\n\nThe dig resembled the heavy heaping of shade Mariah Carey delivered to Jennifer Lopez while speaking to the paparazzi in the early 2000s.\n\nPeople on Twitter immediately picked up on the now-legendary diss.\n\nmy mans out here giving Ann Coulter the Mariah Carey treatment https://t.co/8Pw6RMopAj \u2014 Christopher Johnson (@chris_bro_chill) February 15, 2019\n\nWhen the president pulls a @MariahCarey and says \u201ci don\u2019t know her\u201d when asked about @AnnCoulter \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/APfh41BtkT \u2014 Naomi Pe\u00f1a (@naomi325) February 15, 2019\n\nPOTUS just Mariah Carey\u2019d Ann Coulter! \ud83e\udd2dhttps://t.co/ZwolDvPU1p \u2014 Matthew G.

Those include letting the federal government seize private vessels at sea, assuming control of internet traffic, deploying the military as a domestic police force and dozens of other actions unrelated to the national emergency he\u2019s claiming.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-native-american-warren-joke_n_5c646c11e4b09e2092c281bc": "Pool via Getty Images President Donald Trump in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson, the former president and slave owner who signed the Indian Removal Act that led to the Trail of Tears. Trump chose to put Jackson's portrait in the Oval Office and has said he is \"a fan.\"\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Over the weekend, the president of the United States appeared to make a punchline out of Native American genocide to score political points. You might have missed it because hardly any of the nation\u2019s top leaders called him out on it.\n\n\u201cToday Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWill she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the apparent offensiveness of the president\u2019s words. Trump\u2019s use of \u201cTRAIL\u201d in all-caps evokes the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of Native Americans from their homeland in the southeastern United States, which led to thousands of deaths from disease, starvation and exposure. His constant mockery of Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d meanwhile, demeans a historic Native woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Cherokee woman. I have ancestors who were on the trail. And I was \u2015 at this point, I shouldn\u2019t be shocked by anything that President Trump says or does \u2015 I was honestly shocked,\u201d said Candessa Tehee, an assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Northeastern State University. \u201cThat he\u2019s willing to so casually invoke the darkest chapter of American history to take a cheap shot at a rival, I was flabbergasted.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for clarification on what Trump was getting at with this remark.\n\nBut the paradox of Trump is that he is so casually racist against Native Americans, and yet, his slurs go largely unchallenged by both Democratic and Republican leaders \u2015 even as Native groups denounce him.\n\nThis time, some Republicans even tacitly endorsed Trump\u2019s mockery: Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who chairs the House GOP Conference, shrugged off his tweet when asked about it Sunday and tried to refocus on Warren. On the same day as the president\u2019s tweet, the Republican Party sent out a press release titled \u201cFauxcahontas\u2019 Failure To Launch.\u201d Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., piled on Trump\u2019s remark with his own slur.\n\n\u201cWe see our elected officials speaking out vehemently against racism regularly, yet very few have condemned Trump\u2019s racist rants against Natives,\u201d said Raina Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes under President Barack Obama and currently a consultant on tribal policy. \u201cI believe this silence is rooted in the continued invisibility of Native people and the lack of political will by politicians. Some don\u2019t think they have to speak out, so they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNone of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders appeared to directly condemn Trump\u2019s apparent Trail of Tears reference. None of the top four House and Senate Democratic and Republican leaders pushed back on it, either. The only one of those four who responded to a request for comment was Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said, \u201cIf he issues a comment on the President\u2019s tweet I will send it your way.\u201d\n\nWe see our elected officials speaking out vehemently against racism regularly, yet very few have condemned Trump\u2019s racist rants against Natives. Raine Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes under President Barack Obama\n\nOne House leader did speak up. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), chair of the Democratic Caucus, questioned when any Republicans will ever denounce Trump.\n\n\u201cTrail of tears massacre is part of Native American genocide perpetrated against millions of indigenous people,\u201d Jeffries tweeted Monday. \u201cMocking this shameful episode is a hateful trope.\u201d\n\nTrump chose the picture of Jackson for the Oval Office and has said that he is \u201ca fan\u201d of Jackson\u2019s populism.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Here's Trump standing with Native American veterans in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office. He attacked Elizabeth Warren as \"Pocahontas\" at this event.\n\nOn Friday, Trump made a reference to a conservative pundit going \u201coff the reservation,\u201d yet another phrase offensive to at least some Native people.\n\nElected leaders may be understandably reluctant to wade into Trump\u2019s criticisms of Warren, and it would be essentially impossible to respond to every offensive tweet the president fires off. But if they\u2019re not willing to tease apart the difference between Trump attacking Warren versus his slurs and mockery of Native people and culture, it means the president gets away with normalizing racist language in the name of a joke or a campaign attack.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it\u2019s not the Massachusetts senator bearing the brunt of those attacks. It\u2019s indigenous people, over and over again.\n\nPeople in positions of power have a responsibility to call out Trump every time he dehumanizes Native people, said Mary Kathryn Nagle, an attorney and Cherokee Nation citizen. She noted the contrast between the recent widespread condemnation of Virginia elected officials for wearing blackface and the relative silence in response to Trump\u2019s apparent mocking of the Trail of Tears.\n\n\u201cThe effect of that silence is incredibly traumatic, especially for our kids, because when they see that, OK, everyone is upset about blackface but no one is upset that apparently the genocide of my people is a joke? What does that mean about me and my worth as a human being?\u201d Nagle said.\n\nThe president\u2019s attacks on Native people have the equally distressing effect of erasing the stories of real people, she added. Trump is using indigenous people \u201cas characters, as almost cartoons in a political feud,\u201d she said, and that \u201cgives the American public the implicit permission to do that to the actual Native people living here.\u201d\n\nNagle\u2019s take echoes the findings of a groundbreaking, multi-year study conducted by Native researchers that surveyed how the American public views indigenous people. They found that the vast majority of Americans learn about Native people only through pop culture and media, where Native Americans are barely represented \u2014 and when they are, it is typically in the context of racist team mascots for sports teams or stereotypes. Just 13 percent of state history curriculum standards about indigenous people cover events past the year 1900, which means most Americans have no concept of contemporary Native American people.\n\nThe fact that Americans are taught a distorted version of history early on \u2015 one that glosses over the atrocities the U.S. committed against indigenous people \u2015 makes it easier for them not to feel guilty about the country\u2019s history of mass genocide and to keep Native people in the margins, said Dr. Arianne Eason, one of the project\u2019s researchers.\n\n\u201cUntil we start unpacking that, we can live in this space where omission feels OK. It assuages our guilt,\u201d Eason said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to feel bad about what\u2019s happening and contend with a group of people saying literally in our faces, \u2018We are still here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat he\u2019s willing to so casually invoke the darkest chapter of American history to take a cheap shot at a rival, I was flabbergasted. Candessa Tehee, assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Northeastern State University\n\nAdrienne Keene, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and assistant professor of American studies and ethnic studies at Brown University, tweeted that every time she hears \u201cPocahontas\u201d or \u201cLie-awatha\u201d or \u201cchief\u201d jokes, it\u2019s a reminder of how close to the surface and accessible these stereotypes are.\n\n\u201cThese \u2018jokes\u2019 show me that most Americans don\u2019t think of Native folks as your neighbors, your professors, your friends, or your fellow citizens,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump has given no indication that he\u2019s listening to Native communities or their concerns when he goes after Warren. To the contrary, he treats \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2015 a name he has called Warren at least 18 times on Twitter alone \u2015 as a clever insult.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has tried to defend Trump for invoking Pocahontas\u2019 name when attacking Warren by arguing that her name is not a racial slur.\n\nBut Pocahontas was a real Powhatan woman \u201cwhose life was cut short in a terrible way,\u201d as Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) has put it. \u201cWhen I think of that story \u2014 and the hundreds of sad and disturbing stories of how Native people have suffered throughout history, I can\u2019t imagine making a mockery of their names or their lives,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt may seem futile to try to stop Trump\u2019s racist comments about Native people or any other group. But the way people in positions of power respond to him when he does \u2015 or when they don\u2019t respond at all \u2015 arguably matters more.\n\nTrump may never get the message that Native Americans aren\u2019t a mascot or political joke, Nagle said, but hopefully, the next generation will learn \u201cthat what Trump is doing is wrong, and they shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-impeachment-house-democrats_n_5c647b6ee4b09e2092c2987f": "A few weeks ago, Americans got a sneak peek at what it will look like if Congress decides to impeach President Donald Trump. On Jan. 18, BuzzFeed News published a report alleging that Trump had ordered his fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about their efforts during the 2016 presidential campaign to secure Russian government approval to build a Trump Tower Moscow.\n\nCongressional Democrats pounced on the allegation that the president had suborned perjury. It was evidence of \u201cobstruction of justice,\u201d a \u201chigh crime\u201d and an impeachable offense, Democrats tweeted. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) promised to investigate.\n\nThen, special counsel Robert Mueller disputed the report. (BuzzFeed stands by its reporting.)\n\nMueller\u2019s intervention doused the latest excitement. But Democrats\u2019 rapid-fire response revealed that they sense they\u2019re heading toward an inevitable reckoning with this president.\n\n\u201cEvery day it becomes more and more difficult to say we\u2019re not interested in impeachment,\u201d said one Democratic member of Congress.\n\nPutting aside the disputed allegations in the BuzzFeed story, there are already more than a handful of potential areas of inquiry that carry the hallmarks of impeachable offenses. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey to relieve the \u201cgreat pressure\u201d of the investigation into whether his campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election. Before that, he asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to intervene to stop the FBI investigation. Trump has also been named as the \u201cIndividual-1\u201d in a criminal plea agreement who ordered Cohen to break campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cAt some point it\u2019s like if this guy did this bad stuff, he needs to be impeached and we need to do it \u2015 even if there\u2019s a political cost to it,\u201d the Democratic member of Congress said.\n\n\u2018Numerous Allegations Of Corruption And Obstruction\u2019\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the new chair of the House Judiciary Committee, hired two investigators who have previously argued that Trump may have already committed impeachable offenses.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, the first stop for impeachment discussions, made its first real step toward investigating potentially impeachable actions committed by the president on Tuesday. Nadler, the new chairman, announced that he\u2019d hired two legal consultants: Norm Eisen, the former Obama administration ethics czar and chairman of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and Barry Berke, a top-flight white collar defense attorney. Eisen and Berke are both esteemed investigators who have publicly argued that Trump\u2019s actions may already constitute impeachable offenses.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time in our Nation\u2019s history,\u201d Nadler said in a statement announcing the hires. \u201cThe President of the United States faces numerous allegations of corruption and obstruction. His conduct and crude statements threaten the basic legal, ethical, and constitutional norms that maintain our democratic institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House Judiciary Committee is determined to ask critical questions, gather all the information, judiciously assess the evidence, and make sure that the facts are not hidden from the American people,\u201d the chairman added.\n\nNadler\u2019s sober statement reflects the tone that Democratic leadership in Congress would like to project as they begin the methodical effort to build a public case. The understanding among most Democratic lawmakers is that impeachment is a constitutional tool that should only be used on the rare occasion when a president\u2019s acts undermine the rule of law, threaten the liberty of American citizens or attack the integrity of the American government. The acts that could constitute impeachable offenses may include actual crimes, but are not limited to criminal acts.\n\nMany Democrats believe that this standard requires a yet-to-be-disclosed major revelation \u2015 like the obstruction of justice alleged by the BuzzFeed report \u2015 to tip the current situation into impeachment territory. Nadler\u2019s new hires show that he will begin to build a public record while waiting to see if Mueller or anyone else drops the anticipated bombshell.\n\n\u2018Our Elected Officials Haven\u2019t Done Anything\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Billionaire Tom Steyer plans to spend as much as $90 million to advocate for Trump's impeachment.\n\nNot everyone is so patient. Ten days after the BuzzFeed report, hundreds of activists from around the country descended on Washington to urge their elected representatives to impeach the president \u2015 now.\n\nThe conference was hosted by Need to Impeach, an organization launched by billionaire investor Tom Steyer in 2018. Steyer has already gotten 7.1 million Americans to sign a petition calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. He is promising to spend up to $90 million on an advertising and grassroots campaign to pressure Congress to impeach Trump. The former hedge fund manager talked about running for president in 2020, but decided against it after looking at the polling. Instead, he is focused on raising a grassroots army to get Congress to oust Trump before the next election.\n\nSteyer told the 300-some conference attendees that those in favor of impeachment have \u201cwon the argument,\u201d but are losing the public relations battle.\n\n\u201cOur debating team got an \u2018A,\u2019 but in the schoolyard we\u2019re still getting our ass kicked,\u201d he said.\n\nThis man is the crisis in our country. I don\u2019t know why our elected officials haven\u2019t done anything. And I'm really angry. Rita Fox, a Need to Impeach activist\n\nRita Fox, a 63-year-old retired veteran, came to Washington from the Tampa Bay, Florida, area to lobby her congressman, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), to support impeachment.\n\nFox had seen an ad for Steyer\u2019s organization on CNN one day and went online to sign the group\u2019s petition. She went to see him speak in St. Petersburg in September and got further involved with Need to Impeach by organizing her friends to write letters and make phone calls to elect a Democratic House majority in the 2018 elections. In January, she joined Need to Impeach\u2019s push in Washington.\n\n\u201cThis man is the crisis in our country,\u201d Fox said of the president. \u201cI don\u2019t know why our elected officials haven\u2019t done anything. And I\u2019m really angry. I think I\u2019m more angry at them because they alone have the power to do it legally. And I\u2019m just not seeing it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Congress Is Just Getting Started\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Richard Nixon leaves the White House on Aug. 9, 1974, after resigning office to avoid being impeached.\n\nA handful of House Democrats have already signaled a willingness to begin impeachment proceedings. In the previous Congress, Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) introduced two resolutions calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment that focused on the president\u2019s defense of neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, his retweeting of anti-Muslim hate videos and other bigoted statements he\u2019s made. These are not what have traditionally been considered impeachable offenses.\n\nThe House voted to table both of Green\u2019s resolutions. But the number of members who voted to debate them increased from 58 in 2017 to 66 in 2018.\n\nThis year, Green co-sponsored articles of impeachment introduced by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.). These articles are specifically tailored to Trump\u2019s actions in removing Comey in an effort to quash the investigation into his campaign \u2015 an act that comes closer to the impeachable offenses approved by the House Judiciary Committee in Nixon\u2019s case. It is almost certain that this resolution will not be used if Democratic leaders choose to move forward with impeachment.\n\nTrump\u2019s alleged high crimes mirror Nixon\u2019s, former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman (D-N.Y.) told the Need to Impeach conference in January. Holtzman served on the House Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach Nixon.\n\nMueller is way down the road. Congress is just getting started. I\u2019d like Congress to get way down the road, too. Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswoman who voted to impeach Nixon\n\nConsider the parallels: Nixon ordered the CIA to stop the FBI from investigating the Watergate break-in. Trump told Coats to get Comey to stop the Russia investigation. Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the Saturday Night Massacre. Trump fired Comey and then he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions because he felt Sessions had not done enough to stop the investigation. Nixon ordered his chief of staff H.R. Haldeman to lie to Congress. That is what the disputed BuzzFeed story alleges Trump did with Cohen. Nixon dangled pardons in front of the Watergate burglars to keep them quiet. Trump is openly dangling a pardon before his former campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nDespite these similarities, Holtzman told the impeachment-hungry attendees that she did not think Congress should \u201cbegin impeachment now.\u201d Instead, she said that Congress needed to start educating the public through televised committee hearings about the allegations against the president. The only reason that Nixon was about to be impeached before he resigned and the public was prepared for that result was that Congress had held open hearings on the Watergate scandal, she argued.\n\n\u201cMueller is way down the road,\u201d Holtzman said. \u201cCongress is just getting started. I\u2019d like Congress to get way down the road, too.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats appear ready to start down that path.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-emergency-tantrum_us_5c62fbf3e4b00ba63e4b0a53": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While the six previous presidents collectively declared dozens of national emergencies, Donald Trump\u2019s one over a border wall would be the first to finance an unpopular construction project that congresses in both his own country and a neighboring one have refused to pay for.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House said Trump would sign a spending bill to keep the government funded \u2015 but he would also declare a national emergency since Congress wasn\u2019t going to give him the billions he wants for a wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\nTrump has been warning for months that he would declare an emergency if Congress failed to appropriate $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico. He repeated the threat at a recent re-election rally in El Paso, Texas.\n\n\u201cAs I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee,\u201d he said of a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.375 billion for border barriers. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re building the wall anyway.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, though, choosing to declare a national emergency would likely trigger a law from Congress finding his declaration invalid, lawsuits challenging its legality, or both.\n\n\u201cThe National Emergencies Act does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because Congress chooses not to give him the toys that he likes,\u201d said Greg Chen, the head of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the legal challenges would be filed instantly,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on national emergencies at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nOf late, Trump and his allies have argued that national emergencies are nothing extraordinary, that every previous president going back to the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976 has used it and that nearly three dozen are still in force.\n\nOn Sunday he tweeted to his 58 million followers a statement from Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.): \u201cThere have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.\u201d\n\nYet what the White House and Trump\u2019s defenders do not mention is that no previous president has declared a national emergency for a pet project that most Americans oppose, that Congress has refused to support and that he promised during his campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because Congress chooses not to give him the toys that he likes. Greg Chen, American Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nDouglas Rivlin, a spokesman for the pro-immigration group America\u2019s Voice, said Trump is primarily trying to work up his hard-core base by painting immigrants as criminals, just as he did in the weeks leading up to the November midterm elections.\n\nRivlin added that it was ironic that an absurd campaign promise has now become the singular focus of his administration. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a joke. It\u2019s always been a promise that didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an applause line. And yet it is driving national policy at this point.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump did not offhandedly joke about forcing Mexico to pay for a massive, 30-foot-tall, reinforced concrete wall. He promised that he would force Mexico to pay for it \u2014 literally hundreds of times in his rallies, and even in interviews when he was asked whether he was serious.\n\nIn a March 2016 memo, Trump claimed he would force Mexico to make \u201ca one-time payment of $5-$10 billion\u201d or face garnishment of remittances from Mexican immigrants to their families in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThat fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cBut even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt.\u201d\n\nUpon taking office, Trump did not once broach the idea of Mexico paying in his conversations with that country\u2019s leaders, according to the Mexican government. In fact, in his first conversation with Mexico\u2019s then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto days after taking office, Trump acknowledged that Mexico would never pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly to avoid hurting Trump\u2019s standing with his supporters.\n\nAfter that phone call, more than a year passed before Trump started demanding a wall, only this time from U.S. taxpayers and Congress, which led to his claims starting in October that he had the power simply to ignore Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen the rules don\u2019t suit him, he breaks the rules, and then it gets tied up in courts,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cThis has been the pattern of his life.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the exclusive role given to Congress in the Constitution to decide whether and how much to spend for any given priority, Chen said.\n\nThat fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn\u2019t want to do. But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt. Douglas Rivlin, spokesman, America\u2019s Voice\n\nAll but a handful of the previous five dozen emergency declarations over the past four decades have imposed trade restrictions or other economic sanctions against nations for their aggressive behavior and human rights abuses.\n\nA May 22, 1997, declaration by Bill Clinton prohibited new investment in Burma. An April 3, 2014, declaration by Barack Obama imposed sanctions on leaders of South Sudan. The very first emergency \u2014 which is in place to this day \u2014 was declared by Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on Iran after the 1979 revolution.\n\nOnly a handful of the declarations have dealt with national policy outside of targeted sanctions. One, declared by Ronald Reagan in 1983, reinstated a ban on the export of technologies that could be used for military purposes. Congress had allowed the ban to lapse but did not oppose his use of the Emergencies Act to put it back into force.\n\nAnother came in 2005, when George W. Bush, without technically declaring an emergency, decreed the suspension of a requirement to pay workers involved in the Hurricane Katrina recovery a certain minimum wage. Democrats and some Republicans did object to that one, and set a vote in the House to disapprove it. Bush rescinded his decree the day before the scheduled vote.\n\nNot one of the previous emergencies, however, did anything close to what Trump is trying to do: pay for a project not only without Congress\u2019 approval, but after Congress has specifically rejected his request several times.\n\n\u201cThe law was intended to authorize a president to take action in a crisis that was unfolding too quickly for Congress to respond,\u201d Chen said. \u201cCongress has, in fact, made a decision. Congress has chosen not to give him the funds that he would like.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear if or when Trump would actually declare an emergency. Republican senators have already expressed their fears that enough of them would side with Democrats on the issue that a law rescinding the emergency would clear Congress, forcing Trump to back down or veto it \u2014 a choice that would likely lead to an attempt to override the veto. White House officials would say only that Trump is considering all his options and that he would do everything necessary to deal with the \u201ccrisis\u201d at the border.\n\nChen, though, said that Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 threatening an emergency, but only if Congress refused to give him what he wanted \u2014 have undermined the legal basis for one.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lied-about-getting-special-permission-from-el-paso-fire-dept-says-fire-dept_us_5c62f0b7e4b0a8731aea8cdf": "Trump\u2019s has previously claimed El Paso was one of the country\u2019s most dangerous cities prior to the construction of a government-sanctioned fence dividing the city and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico.

The publication notes that the city \u201chas had a consistently lower crime rate than the average among more than 20 similarly sized cities, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas), who had previously challenged Republicans for a Senate seat, and other El Paso leaders led a counter-demonstration to Trump\u2019s rally on Monday. Trump addressed their protest at the rally and bloviated about the number of people in attendance yet again:\n\n\u201cA young man who\u2019s got very little going for himself, except he\u2019s got a great first name\u2026 He challenged us.

In his State of the Union address last week he claimed, falsely, that border fencing that was built south of the city in 2010 transformed El Paso from a dangerous place into a safe one.\n\nIts Republican mayor lashed out at the president last week for his falsehood. El Paso\u2019s declining crime rate started well before the border fencing was built.\n\nBut Trump repeated the lie Monday night. And for his audience, the lie was now the truth.\n\n\u201cOnce they built that wall, it was amazing how statistically the violence started going down,\u201d 39-year-old El Paso resident Michael Blanco, who owns an accounting business, told HuffPost outside the coliseum. \u201cI\u2019m a complete witness of it.

O\u2019Rourke, a potential presidential candidate, held a protest a few blocks from Trump\u2019s rally Monday night.\n\nThe president taunted O\u2019Rourke from the stage, claiming that the O\u2019Rourke rally attracted a paltry few hundred attendees. El Paso police later estimated that well over 10,000 people attended.\n\nTrump spoke for over an hour \u2014 about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, about Hillary Clinton, about the Green New Deal and about how \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country.\u201d\n\nNick Martin, an investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, watched the speech and noticed someone he recognized sitting in the front row, wearing a baseball hat and an eye patch: Elmer Stewart Rhodes.\n\nRhodes is the founder of the far-right militia group the Oath Keepers.

Here are some of the most egregious examples.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t call on Steve King to resign\n\nTrump notably did not call on Rep.

Few were willing to give King the benefit of the doubt, given his long history of racist sentiments and links to neo-Nazi movements.\n\nHe used a Jewish Star of David to call Hillary Clinton corrupt\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump tweeted a blatantly anti-Semitic image featuring a picture of Hillary Clinton pasted over a backdrop of $100 bills with a six-pointed star \u2014 the Jewish Star of David \u2014 alongside her face.\n\nHuffPost\n\nCritics quickly raised alarm over the image. Using the symbol over a pile of money, they said, is blatantly anti-Semitic and reinforces hateful stereotypes of Jewish greed.\n\nThough Trump insisted that the photo was harmless and was supposed to be seen as a sheriff\u2019s badge \u2015 not the star that Nazis forced Jews to sew onto their clothing during World War II \u2015 some internet sleuthing by Mic revealed that the image was actually created by white supremacists and had appeared on a neo-Nazi forum shortly before Trump tweeted it.\n\nHe mocked Jews as greedy businesspeople\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2015, Trump attempted to relate to members of the Republican Jewish Coalition by invoking the stereotype of Jews as greedy, cunning businesspeople. \u201cI\u2019m a negotiator, like you folks,\u201d Trump told the crowd.\n\n\u201cIs there anyone who doesn\u2019t renegotiate deals in this room?\u201d Trump continued. \u201cPerhaps more than any room I\u2019ve spoken to.\u201d\n\nHe also implied during that event that he didn\u2019t expect to win support from the Jewish Republican group because he couldn\u2019t be swayed by campaign donations.\n\nHe hesitated to denounce white supremacy in Charlottesville\n\nAfter a massive white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counter-protester dead in August 2017, Trump took more than 48 hours to denounce the violence and initially said there was an \u201cegregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\u201d\n\nWhite supremacists celebrated Trump\u2019s reaction as a victory.

(In fact, the city\u2019s decrease in violent crime predated the wall.)\n\nIt was those remarks, along with Trump\u2019s choice to hold a campaign rally in the heavily Latino border town, that prompted more than 50 civil rights and advocacy groups to organize the rally where O\u2019Rourke delivered the final address.\n\nTrump doubled down on his calls for a wall on Monday, saying his plans along the Rio Grande separating the U.S. and Mexico were already moving forward.\n\n\u201cToday we started a big beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande,\u201d Trump told supporters at the event, which was filled to capacity. \u201cRight smack on the Rio Grande.\u201d\n\nThe size of the crowds at the dual rallies symbolized a wider schism between the values of two social movements that will likely define the politics of 2020 \u2015 one fixated on security that views the border as a threat and an alternate view that champions openness.\n\nThe president addressed the lawmaker\u2019s competing event before flying out of Washington, telling reporters that he had a \u201cvery long\u201d line at his rally and that, though O\u2019Rourke had one too, \u201cit\u2019s a tiny, little line.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally, however, began with a large march through El Paso.

Monday night\u2019s march was his second, and he anticipated he would join more in the future because of Trump\u2019s hostility toward his hometown.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I don\u2019t like what he has to say about El Paso,\u201d Campa told HuffPost. \u201cEl Paso Is love. We gotta make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nRally-goers at times chanted \u201cno more lies\u201d as they followed O\u2019Rourke during the march, which numbered in the thousands, according to estimates by local media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re a community that\u2019s proud to be inclusive, proud to be welcoming \u201d said Robert Heyman, policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to stand against President Trump\u2019s racism, against Trump\u2019s wall.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke challenged his supporters to champion policies of inclusion during his speech, painting El Paso as a city built around community, not division.\n\n\u201cWe are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe are going to show the country who we are. We\u2019re going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with more details from the Beto O\u2019Rourke rally.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/payday-lenders-sure-have-a-cozy-relationship-with-the-trump-administration_n_5c65d5e3e4b0233af9732deb": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see the potential influence that predatory lenders may have,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nA company that defrauded customers but only got a slap on the wrist from the Trump administration also made a large donation to the president\u2019s 2017 inaugural committee.\n\nLast month, Enova International, an online payday lender that operates the brands NetCredit and CashNetUSA, agreed to pay a $3 million fine for illegally taking money from customers\u2019 bank accounts and failing to honor loan extensions. But the settlement included no refunds for the victims.\n\nPayday lenders as an industry donated more than $1 million to the inauguration, according to the liberal group Allied Progress, as well as tens of thousands to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. The Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group for the industry, last year started holding its annual conferences at a Trump hotel in Florida.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced it would rescind parts of a new federal regulation that had been designed to rein in abusive lending practices that lead people to take out loan after loan and sink into debt.\n\nFavorable treatment for payday lenders is consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s pro-business ideology, however, and there\u2019s no indication that donations have directly led to favorable treatment. But the donations are not a coincidence, either.\n\nConsumer advocates have complained that under Trump, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2015 which was created during the Obama years in large part to go after payday lenders\u2015 has drastically scaled back its regulatory mission and been softer on bad actors.\n\nThe regulation that the CFPB said it would rescind last week would have required small-dollar lenders like CashNetUSA to make sure their customers can pay them back \u2015 which would fundamentally disrupt the business model.\n\n\u201cWith a couple of exceptions nearly every enforcement settlement that we see makes you scratch your head and say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they pay more, why didn\u2019t consumers get anything?\u2019\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nAs for the campaign contributions, Saunders said, \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see the potential influence that predatory lenders may have.\u201d\n\nThe bureau said Enova earned \u201cmillions\u201d by illegally debiting customers\u2019 accounts without authorization, in some cases sticking customers with bank fees. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the CFPB said the bureau doesn\u2019t monitor political donations and that the people making decisions on the Enova case had no knowledge of the company\u2019s donation before HuffPost asked about it.\n\nThe regulation that the CFPB said it would rescind last week would have required small-dollar lenders like CashNetUSA to make sure their customers can pay them back \u2015 which would fundamentally disrupt the business model.\n\nPayday lenders typically require borrowers to allow debits from their bank accounts or sign a postdated check, and their customers are often so strapped for cash that the first loan rolls over into a series of additional, costlier loans, according to CFPB research. While the product can be helpful for someone without access to regular credit, with hefty fees the loans essentially bear triple-digit interest rates that are outright illegal in a number of states.\n\nIn its financial disclosures, Enova said demand for its product is fueled in part by \u201cstagnant to declining growth in the household income for working-class individuals.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Trump appointed his budget director, Mike Mulvaney, to also be the acting director of the consumer bureau, despite (or because of) the fact that Mulvaney opposed its creation in the first place. The former Republican congressman intervened in one investigation of a payday lender last year to drop charges that would have resulted in $8 million worth of restitution to the company\u2019s customers, Reuters reported in June. The company, South Carolina-based Security Group Inc., was found to have harassed customers at their homes and jobs in an effort to collect debts. It agreed to pay a $5 million fine.\n\nAs a former congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney ranked among the top recipients of campaign contributions from the payday lending industry. He has said that when he served in the House, he was more likely to listen to lobbyists if they contributed to his campaign. He proposed eliminating the consumer bureau and called it a sick joke. Mulvaney has since left the bureau to become Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff.\n\nAs a recently as 2006, the payday industry\u2019s political spending favored Democrats, but has since tilted heavily toward Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congress-bucks-trump-federal-pay-raise_n_5c65b810e4b0bcddd40fd058": "Update: Both the Senate and House have passed the spending bill, and the White House said the president will sign it.\n\nThe members of Congress tasked with hashing out a plan to avert another government shutdown want to give federal employees a raise, defying President Donald Trump\u2019s previous efforts to freeze their pay.\n\nThe funding deal put together by Senate negotiators calls for a 1.9 percent across-the-board raise for government employees for 2019, half a percentage point more than their pay hike last year. The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to approve the bill Thursday, sending it to the Democratic-controlled House, where it also faces favorable odds.\n\nThe White House has not yet indicated whether the president will sign the legislation. The package includes $1.4 billion in funding for a physical barrier along the southwestern border \u2014 far short of the $5.7 billion Trump previously demanded. In fact, the deal is worse for Trump than he could have had in December, when he said he would \u201cproudly\u201d shut down the government to secure more money for a wall he used to promise Mexico would pay for.\n\nBut he was blamed more than Democrats for the record-setting 35-day shutdown and may accept the deal in order to avoid further political damage. If he does, the legislation will mark a retreat for Trump not just on the wall but also in his political fight with the federal workforce.\n\nSince taking office in 2017, Trump has tried to weaken government job protections and peel back collective bargaining rights, lumping civil servants in with what he calls \u201cthe swamp.\u201d He has also periodically wielded the threat of a government pay freeze, even while boasting about a strong economy and rising wages in the private sector.\n\nAfter the Senate proposed a 1.9 percent increase last year for 2019, he sent a letter to Congress saying he wanted to nullify it. He essentially said the government couldn\u2019t afford to pay any raises, even though Republicans recently passed tax cuts expected to increase the deficit by nearly $2 trillion through 2028.\n\nEven though a majority in the House \u2014 controlled at the time by the GOP \u2014 never signed off on a pay increase, an automatic 2.1 percent increase would have gone into effect anyway on Jan. 1., because of the federal pay schedule. But Trump intervened to block it, resetting the pay hike to zero through executive order.\n\nThe government was partially shut down at the time, with roughly 800,000 workers going without paychecks. A union for federal employees said Trump was \u201cpouring salt into the wound\u201d by pre-empting a raise when so many workers were furloughed or working without pay.\n\nThe 1.9 percent increase in the spending proposal would be the largest since 2009, though still below the raises that preceded the recession.\n\nBut now it would be much tougher for Trump politically to reject a modest across-the-board hike after a damaging shutdown. By and large, Americans sympathized with federal workers who were subjected to more than a month of financial anxiety through no fault of their own. In one U.S. poll, respondents said, 50 percent to 35 percent, that Trump should have compromised to avoid the funding lapse.\n\nThe National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, an advocacy group for federal workers, called the pay increase proposed in the potential spending deal \u201clong overdue common sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis average 1.9 percent pay increase is a small, yet positive, step to ensure the federal government can recruit and retain the best of the best for the benefit of the American people,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Ken Thomas.\n\nFederal workers have faced some lean raises in recent years, compared with historical standards. Then-President Barack Obama oversaw a three-year pay freeze in the wake of the Great Recession, though he tried to end it earlier than planned but was stymied by Republicans. Federal employees can still get raises through step increases during a pay freeze, but those depend on tenure and pay grade and aren\u2019t available to everyone in a given year.\n\nThe 1.4 percent pay increase in 2018 was the largest across-the-board pay bump in eight years. Each of the four preceding years saw a 1.0 percent increase. The 1.9 percent increase in the spending proposal would be the largest since 2009, though still below the raises that preceded the recession.\n\nIf Congress passes the spending bill and Trump signs it \u2015 they have until Friday night to avoid a shutdown \u2015 federal government employees will make out much better than government contractors.\n\nWhile the former were granted backpay by Congress after the last shutdown, the latter missed out on several weeks\u2019 worth of earnings while federal offices and functions were closed. Democrats and some Republicans tried to insert a provision in the current proposal to get those workers backpay, but it became a sticking point for GOP leaders. Ultimately, it was left out.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-el-paso-song_us_5c63ad0fe4b03de94296d7a8": "President Donald Trump made a lot of wild and outright false claims during his rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night.

The 10-9 vote was along party lines, with every Democrat on the committee opposed.\n\nUnder current rules, senators have up to 30 hours to debate a nominee after they have voted to advance the nomination to a final vote \u2015 otherwise known as post-cloture time. Republicans say Democrats are wildly abusing this process to slow the confirmation of many noncontroversial lower court and administrative nominees. They point out that some government agencies are having to run with a bare-bones staff because many of their lower-ranking administrative nominees are still awaiting a confirmation vote.\n\nThe GOP proposal, which was introduced by committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and by James Lankford (R-Okla.), would limit that post-cloture debate time to two hours per nominee \u2015 significantly speeding up the process. It\u2019s similar to a temporary deal on nominations that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) negotiated with Republicans in 2013 \u2015 except the Blunt proposal would change the rules permanently.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to abuse the system like Democrats have been and not expect for people to try to end that abuse,\u201d Blunt told HuffPost last week.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees for lower-level government posts have had an unusually high number of calls for Senate cloture votes to cut off debate and move to the final vote, according to the Pew Research Center. However, Republicans employed the tactic of drawing out debate with equal zeal to slow the confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees after his re-election in 2012, a pattern that led to Reid\u2019s rules change in 2013.\n\nMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the rules committee, said during the markup hearing that Republicans are pursuing the change \u201conly because they want to ram more nominees through.\u201d She noted that part of the reason some government agencies aren\u2019t running at full capacity is that the White House simply hasn\u2019t nominated anyone to the posts.\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal; this is not just a minor proposal to come our way,\u201d Klobuchar said on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the proposal was reported favorably out of committee on Wednesday, it will likely fall short of the 60-vote threshold necessary for final passage due to Democratic opposition. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier this week that he would oppose it unless Republicans agree to move the threshold on Supreme Court nominations back up to 60 votes or restore the use of \u201cblue slips\u201d over judicial nominees. Republicans abandoned the long-standing tradition after Trump\u2019s election, a practice that has been followed by both parties for decades and allows senators from a nominee\u2019s state to express their opinion on the individual.\n\nRepublicans suggested on Wednesday that they intend to move forward and pass the new rules proposal unilaterally by going \u201cnuclear\u201d on the Senate floor \u2015 a move that would require only 51 votes for approval.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake that Republicans can change this and will,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a top ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said during the hearing.\n\nFew things generate acrimony in the Senate like rules changes \u2015 especially from those who are in the minority. Democrats complained about GOP obstruction on nominations under Obama and eliminated the 60-vote threshold on the president\u2019s picks to appeals courts as a result. When Republicans took power, McConnell subsequently changed the rules on Supreme Court nominations in order to confirm Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said a Republican proposal to change Senate rules and confirm presidential nominees more quickly does not \u201cin any way seriously disadvantage the minority.\u201d\n\nIn the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans have confirmed judicial nominees at a historic pace with scores of conservative new appeals, circuit and district court judges in the federal judiciary. They\u2019ve also succeeded in confirming two of Trump\u2019s picks to the Supreme Court: Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s refusal in 2016 to consider Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, remains a raw issue among many Democrats in the Senate. The blockade of Garland came up, again and again, at the hearing on Wednesday after Republicans complained about \u201crecord\u201d Democratic obstruction in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt was a conscious decision made by the majority leader to deny us the ordinary tradition of filling this vacancy,\u201d Sen.

The probe resulted in the arrests of 18 Saudis, including 15 operatives who had allegedly acted as the hit squad. Saudi Arabia has vehemently denied MBS played a role in the murder.\n\nBut Barrack, like his longtime friend Trump, apparently rejected the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s determination that MBS had directed Khashoggi\u2019s assassination. Instead, Barrack said in a statement Wednesday that he feels the \u201cbad acts of a few should not be interpreted as the failure of an entire sovereign kingdom.\u201d\n\nRead the rest of his statement below:\n\nHaving spent over 40 years in the region I can attest that the rule of law and monarchies across the Middle East are confusing to the West and support for change and rule of law is essential as the agony and mistakes of great change take place.

I believe that as a nation we do constantly work to lead by example, and I believe that we still do. I apologize for not making it clear at the time that I consider the killing reprehensible.\n\nDuring the panel Tuesday, CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson had asked Barrack how Khashoggi\u2019s murder may have damaged Saudi Arabia\u2019s reputation on the world stage.\n\nIn his rambling response, Barrack didn\u2019t appear outraged by the journalist\u2019s murder, instead claiming the West \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand the rule of law\u201d in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThe atrocities in any autocratic country are dictated by the rule of law,\u201d he said, \u201cso for us to dictate what we think is the moral code there when we have a young man in a regime that\u2019s trying to push themselves into 2030 I think is a mistake.\u201d\n\nBarrack\u2019s comments echoed similar statements Trump has made in defense of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader,\u201d then-candidate Trump said during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in December 2015.\n\nHost Joe Scarborough reminded Trump that Putin \u201ckills journalists that don\u2019t agree with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in the world right now, Joe.

He has since expressed support for more guns in schools \u2015 including an effort to arm some teachers \u2015 earning criticism from a vocal sector of Parkland students who were moved to fight against the powerful gun lobby.\n\nThe critics, including David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez, said they were not invited to the White House listening session. They went on to lead a nationwide gun control protest, March for Our Lives, in late March of last year.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s statement, the president touted his support for the STOP\n\nSchool Violence Act, a bipartisan measure to finance school safety training and security equipment, along with a measure to strengthen the national criminal background check system. Neither is a gun control measure. The Trump administration did tighten gun control in late 2018 by enacting a ban on bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to mimic machine guns, but that effort was not a response to Parkland.\n\nA December report issued by the Federal Commission on School Safety, convened by the Trump administration, downplayed the role of guns in school violence, instead focusing on rolling back certain Obama-era policies. The report also recommended arming some teachers and improving mental health care in schools.\n\nGun legislation has largely stalled at the federal level due to Republican opposition. Yet some progress has been made at the state level.

Now, WNYC and ProPublica have identified evidence of potential tax law violations by the committee.\n\nA spokesman confirmed that the nonprofit 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee paid the Trump International Hotel a rate of $175,000 per day for event space \u2014 in spite of internal objections at the time that the rate was far too high. If the committee is deemed by auditors or prosecutors to have paid an above-market rate, that could violate tax laws prohibiting self-dealing, according to experts.\n\nTax law prohibits nonprofits from paying inflated prices to entities that are owned by people who also control or influence the nonprofit\u2019s activities.\n\n\u201cEvery legitimate nonprofit is very concerned with this,\u201d said Doug White, a veteran adviser to tax-exempt organizations, speaking generally. \u201cYou\u2019re benefiting a private person, and you\u2019re using the nonprofit to do it.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural committee also spent at least $1.5 million at a hotel in which the investment firm of the committee\u2019s chairman, Tom Barrack, held a small stake.\n\nIn addition, the inaugural nonprofit appears not to have disclosed multiple gifts to the committee on its tax return, as required by law.\n\nTrump\u2019s inaugural committee spent more than $100 million, almost twice the amount spent on the next-most expensive inaugural party, that of Barack Obama in 2009. In addition to probing how the nonprofit spent its money, investigators are examining whether the inaugural received improper donations from foreigners. Inaugural nonprofits are prohibited from receiving donations from people who are not U.S. citizens.\n\nThe committee paid a total of $700,000 to the Trump International Hotel for event spaces for four days in January 2017. At the time, a consultant working for the inaugural committee expressed her concern over email that the price quoted by the Trump hotel \u2014 $175,000 per day for several event spaces \u2014 was too high, as ProPublica and WNYC reported in December.\n\n\u201cPlease take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,\u201d wrote Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an experienced New York-based event planner, suggesting a fair rate for the event spaces would be at most $85,000 per day, less than half of what was ultimately paid. That fee did not cover catering.\n\nAri Krupkin, an event planner at the Markham Group in Washington, said event space rentals typically come as part of a package that includes catering and audio-visual. Without those services included in the price, he said, \u201c$175,000 a day seems more than egregious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be a tax law violation,\u201d said Brett Kappel, an attorney at Akerman LLP who advises nonprofits. \u201cThose emails would be of great interest to the Internal Revenue Service if they were to conduct an audit. They probably will be of great interest to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York, which is investigating the inaugural committee.\u201d\n\nTax law bars nonprofits such as the inaugural committee from insider deals that would unduly benefit people \u2014 in this case the Trump family \u2014 that have influence over the nonprofit, Kappel said. In legal parlance, these are known as excess benefit transactions. A key question would be whether the Trump hotel charged the inaugural committee above-market rates, which could violate tax rules, Kappel said. If an IRS audit found such a civil violation, the inaugural committee would have to pay taxes on the amount of money it overpaid.\n\nIt could become a criminal violation, Kappel said, if investigators uncover evidence that people knew that charging above-market rates to enrich the Trump Organization was illegal and did it anyway.\n\nA question on the mandatory nonprofit tax return, Form 990, asks whether the organization engaged in any excess benefit transactions. The inaugural committee checked the \u201cNo\u201d box.\n\nThe inaugural committee\u2019s tax return states that it had a written conflict-of-interest policy, but the spokesman declined to provide the policy to reporters. Atchley & Associates, the Texas firm that prepared the tax form, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe inaugural committee has said that overall, for the event spaces and other expenses, it paid more than $1.5 million to the Trump hotel, as first reported by ABC and The New York Times.\n\nIvanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and an executive at the Trump Organization at the time, was on the email chain about the Trump hotel event. She connected Rick Gates, the inaugural committee\u2019s deputy chairman, with a hotel executive when Gates was seeking a price quote for the ballroom. Ivanka Trump\u2019s spokesman in December said she only passed on the note and said that the inaugural should pay a \u201cmarket rate.\u201d Her spokesman did not respond to inquiries for this story.\n\nIn her email, Wolkoff, who was a friend of Melania Trump\u2019s, pointed out that since other venues were donating their spaces, the Trump hotel\u2019s rate was particularly troubling. The company that runs events at Union Station, the site for the inaugural\u2019s candlelight dinner, donated the iconic space, according to a contract obtained by WNYC and ProPublica. Barrack\u2019s own wine was also on the menu at the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, an exclusive inauguration week event hosted by Barrack. \u201cIt was my honor to have donated wine from my personal vineyard, completely free of charge,\u201d Barrack told Vinepair.\n\nThe Union Station donation and the wine do not appear to be included on the inaugural committee\u2019s tax return, which is supposed to report non-cash contributions. The committee spokesman declined to answer detailed questions about the omission and other issues.\n\nIn addition, the inaugural spent money at a hotel then partly owned by the investment firm of Barrack, the businessman and friend of Donald Trump\u2019s who chaired the inaugural committee. The committee has said it spent at least $1.5 million at the Fairmont, a Washington hotel owned by the conglomerate AccorHotels. Barrack\u2019s investment firm Colony Capital owned a roughly 5 percent stake in AccorHotels at the time of the inaugural, which it sold soon after. AccorHotels is run by a longtime former Colony executive. The inaugural spent as much or more at the Fairmont as it did at the Trump International, the Times reported.\n\nThe White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said this week that the subpoena to the inaugural committee \u201chas nothing to do with the White House.\u201d\n\nThis week, ProPublica and WNYC reported that Barrack\u2019s firm developed a plan after the inaugural to profit from its close ties with Trump and the incoming administration.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rem-everybody-hurts-meme_n_5c67bcb7e4b033a79942db5f": "The members of former American rock band R.E.M. have made it crystal clear how they feel about President Donald Trump\u2019s sharing of a meme mocking Democrats, which featured one of their most iconic songs.\n\nTrump shared the video, which was set to the group\u2019s 1992 hit \u201cEverybody Hurts,\u201d on Friday.

The shutdown \u2015 the longest in U.S. history \u2015 added to the agency\u2019s existing backlog and resulted in \u201creal harm\u201d for taxpayers, according to the 2018 National Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s report to Congress, issued by the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\n\n\u201cThe five weeks could not have come at a worse time for the IRS,\u201d National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson wrote in the annual report. \u201cMake no mistake about it, these numbers translate into real harm to real taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown began on Dec. 22. Funds for government agencies allotted in a previous spending bill ran out and President Donald Trump had vowed to veto any new spending bill from Congress that didn\u2019t allocate $5.7 billion toward his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Democrats had steadfastly declined to do. Ten days later, tax season began.\n\nHaving to implement the massive new tax law pushed by Republicans, along with a completely restructured tax form, already presented IRS workers with new challenges this season, Olson wrote in the report.\n\n\u201cThe IRS was already in a position of entering the filing season with a backlog of items and with its resources stretched thin,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe IRS considers tax season to last from Jan. 1 to April 30. In the early days of the shutdown, tax season had not yet begun and the IRS furloughed the vast majority of its roughly 80,000 workers. Less than 10,000 workers during that time period were deemed essential and worked without pay.\n\nThe five weeks could not have come at a worse time for the IRS. ... Make no mistake about it, these numbers translate into real harm to real taxpayers. National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson in the report\n\nAs the shutdown stretched into January, the IRS released a new contingency plan ordering over 46,000 workers to work without pay amid tax season. Most Taxpayer Advocate Service employees, including Olson and the rest of the annual report\u2019s staff, were furloughed, severely hindering the group\u2019s ability to help taxpayers resolve their problems with the IRS.\n\nTrump agreed to end the shutdown on Jan. 25 but said he would close down the government again or declare a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall if negotiations between Republicans and Democrats failed by the new Feb. 15 appropriations deadline.\n\nA day before the shutdown ended, the Taxpayer Advocate Service determined the IRS had over 5 million pieces of mail that had not yet been processed, as well as 80,000 responses to tax credit audits that had not been addressed and 87,000 amended returns awaiting processing. Because the shutdown caused a backlog of tax form requests, the IRS suggested that employers consider requesting filing extensions.\n\nThe IRS entered tax season \u201cinundated with correspondence, phone calls, and inventories of unresolved prior year audits and identity theft cases,\u201d Olson wrote in the report.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Olson wrote, taxpayers were clearly hurt by the shutdown\u2019s kneecapping of the IRS\u2019s workforce. No IRS employee was excepted during the shutdown to release or withdraw liens or release levies.\n\n\u201cWith respect to notices of levy, if the taxpayer cannot contact the IRS and make other payment arrangements within 21 days of the issuance of the levy, the employer or financial institution must pay over the funds to the IRS,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe 21-day period for over 18,000 levies expired during the shutdown.\u201d\n\nIRS phone lines were significantly clogged in the days after the shutdown. For the week ending Jan. 26, the last week of the shutdown, Accounts Management phone lines answered roughly 36 percent of calls with an average speed of answer of 32 minutes. The Installment Agreement/Balance Due phone lines answered just under 13 percent of calls with an average answer speed of 93 minutes.\n\nBy Feb. 2, the end of the first week after the shutdown ended, most phone line levels slightly improved with one exception: the Installment Agreement/Balance Due phone lines answered just 6.7 percent of calls.\n\n\u201cThis means for that week 93.3 percent of the taxpayers calling to make payment arrangements were unable to speak to a live assistor,\u201d Olson wrote.\n\nAnother shutdown looms as the Feb. 15 deadline approaches for another government funding bill \u2015 which Trump has said must contain an agreement on border security spending between Democrats and Republicans. In her report, Olson recommended Congress \u201cat the very least\u201d exempt certain IRS workers from being furloughed or ordered to work without pay during future appropriations lapses.\n\nThe shutdown created a lot of anxiety for IRS employees as a result of missing two paychecks, Olson noted.\n\n\u201cSome employees could not pay their bills and others were deeply worried they would miss payments if the shutdown continued for much longer,\u201d Olson wrote. \u201cYet when the shutdown ended, IRS employees returned to work with energy and generally hit the ground running, eager to make sure the agency could deliver the filing season as well as achieve its broader mission.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe IRS faces many challenges as an agency \u2015 and this report documents many of them \u2015 but the dedication of the IRS workforce is a notable bright spot.\u201d\n\nIRS employees weren\u2019t the only federal employees affected by the recent shutdown. Over 800,000 workers were furloughed or, if deemed essential, ordered to work without pay. Many government contractors \u2015 estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands if not millions \u2015 went without work.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-butterfly-center-border-barrier-restraining-order_us_5c63632de4b03de94296ae49": "The National Butterfly Center in Texas has filed for a restraining order to stop the construction of a border barrier across its land. The court action argues that the federal government\u2019s property grab violates the Constitution and will cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the environment.\n\nThe move could be the beginning of Texas clashes with the federal government over property confiscations as the Trump administration begins building border walls in the Rio Grande Valley. Some private property owners have already denied federal requests to allow access to begin surveying their land for construction sites, The Washington Post reported.\n\nFederal contractors appeared at the site unannounced in the summer of 2017 \u2014 long before funds were approved for any construction \u2014 and began ripping out trees and brush in the 100-acre butterfly refuge in Mission, refuge Executive Director Marianna Trevino-Wright told HuffPost. Construction was expected to begin sometime this month. The center attracts about 35,000 visitors annually for a chance to view about 200 species of butterflies as well as a wide range of birds in the area.\n\nAs building preparation is undertaken, \u201cDefendants\u2019 constitutional violations are escalating,\u201d the center\u2019s lawyers wrote in court papers filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \u201cImmediate injunctive relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nThe motion accuses the government of unreasonable search and seizure in taking control of the land, and seizure of property without due process of law.\n\n\u201cBy summarily depriving [the center] of its property without due process of law, Defendants defy centuries of democratic values that shield Americans from government action depriving individuals of their rightful property without notice and an opportunity to be heard,\u201d the lawyers argued.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen is named as defendant.\n\nThe butterfly center is also asking for a preliminary injunction until the government has properly assessed the environmental impact of the barrier as mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe planned 18 feet of steel bollards on top of an 18-foot concrete wall will cut off 70 acres of the refuge closest to the Rio Grande. Wildlife will be trapped on the river side during floods, while animals on the other side won\u2019t be able to get to lifesaving water. The proposed height of the barrier will also block many butterflies and birds, according to the center.\n\nThe barrier, which would be two miles from the border, would also mean that Americans who want to get from one part of America to another, for recreation along the Rio Grande, will have to go through a security system at the wall.\n\nThe planned project would clear out a 150-foot wide area along the border as an \u201cenforcement zone.\u201d Bulldozing and subsequent vehicles, noise, lights and human activity will destroy the area as a refuge for wildlife, Wright said.\n\nOther construction is slated to soon begin at two other wildlife refuges.\n\nA federal judge ruled last week that the government can begin surveying land owned by a small Texas Catholic church, which would also be cut off from the rest of America on a strip of land along the river. The local diocese has said it will battle any land confiscation by the federal government as a violation of the constitutional right of free expression of religion.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental advocacy groups late last year also sued the Trump administration over planned construction in the Rio Grande Valley, including at the National Butterfly Center, and other areas. The suit argued that the administration\u2019s decision to waive environmental regulations to speed construction was an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d power grab. The center has estimated that 93 endangered species will be further threatened by the barriers. The case is pending.\n\nFunding to build a massive barrier along 33 miles of the Rio Grande Valley was allocated by Congress last year. Money was pointedly not to be used to construct President Donald Trump\u2019s wall \u2014 only for fencing or levees.

The demand that Congress include $5.7 billion to begin work on the wall led to the recent 35-day partial federal government shutdown and may trigger another.\n\nBut the El Pasoans\u2019 message, delivered at back-to-back news conferences, was an early rebuttal to the likely screed to come from Trump at a Monday evening event in solidly Democratic territory.\n\n\u201cWhat has been very frustrating to me \u2015 not just as an elected official but as a proud Pase\u00f1a, a proud fronteriza \u2015 is that this maligning of our community is used as a tool, a political tool, meant to advance a narrative that isn\u2019t true,\u201d said U.S. Rep.

A year later, that number decreased for the first time in seven years as President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to slap import fees on photovoltaic panels loomed.\n\nThat decline continued for a second year in a row in 2018, new data show.\n\nThe Solar Foundation\u2019s annual job census, released Tuesday morning, found employment fell 3.2 percent in 2018 compared with the previous year, equivalent to 7,928 jobs in an industry that employed 242,343 workers as of November.\n\nThe 30 percent tariffs Trump approved on all imported solar panels 13 months ago are the primary cause of the fall, the researchers determined after speaking to more than 3,000 companies via nearly 60,000 phone calls and 49,000 emails. Delayed or insufficient state-level incentives prompted declines in a handful of states that once led the solar boom.\n\n\u201cThe last couple of years have been challenging,\u201d Andrea Luecke, the nonprofit Solar Foundation\u2019s executive director, said by phone ahead of the release.\n\nThe outlook for 2019 improves significantly, and a nascent push for a so-called Green New Deal could dramatically increase demand for solar workers in the next few years.\n\nThe problem, at least on the federal level, was mostly one of perception. Trump came into office in 2017 promising to gut incentives for solar and wind energy in an effort to bolster fossil fuels and cut federal spending. Congress ultimately preserved tax incentives and funding research for renewables.\n\nBut later that year, two domestic solar manufacturers filed complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission, alleging they couldn\u2019t compete with modules built overseas. The companies requested the White House impose fees on imported panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the cost of solar cells.\n\nThe Solar Foundation A chart from the report shows the 159 percent increase in solar employment since 2010.\n\nRoughly three-quarters of Americans employed by the solar industry work in installment and wholesale, sectors bolstered by the availability of cheap panels manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. Yet even the smaller U.S. manufacturing sector has urged the White House to reject the complaint. In a twist, the companies who filed the complaint were foreign-owned. Georgia-based Suniva was owned by a Chinese company; SolarWorld was the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel manufacturer.\n\nIn January 2018, Trump finally reached a decision, approving tariffs slightly lower than what the companies requested. By then, utilities planning large-scale solar farms had already halted or delayed costly, long-term projects in anticipation of the Trump administration\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cA lot of the impact of these tariffs took place prior to the announcement in January,\u201d said Ed Gilliland, a senior director at the Solar Foundation. \u201cLeading up to that, there was a lot of uncertainty about what the tariffs would be.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs had little effect on costs. In China, regulators cut incentives for deploying solar panels, creating a glut in the market that actually sank the average price of solar panels in the U.S. to 38 cents per watt in 2018 from 45 cents per watt in the same period in 2017. The levies also failed to increase U.S. solar manufacturing jobs, which fell nearly 9 percent last year.\n\nIn the Northeast and West Coast, state-level policies were another headwind. California\u2019s growing slate of solar-friendly policies did little to protect utility-scale projects from the concerns over tariffs, leading to a decline of 9,576 jobs in the Golden State. In Massachusetts, the delayed release of a program to pays homeowners to install solar panels shed more than 1,300 jobs from the state\u2019s industry. North Carolina, Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, Georgia and Hawaii all saw three-figure job decreases, too.\n\nElsewhere, the clouds parted. Florida surpassed the Bay State as the No. 2 solar employer, adding 1,769 jobs last year after regulators allowed homeowners to start leasing panels. Illinois, Texas, New York, Ohio and Washington all saw increases of up to 1,308 new jobs jobs.\n\nFor the first time, the report included jobs in Puerto Rico, where the budding industry that sprouted after Hurricane Maria devastated the island\u2019s electrical grid now employs nearly 2,000. (The Solar Foundation excluded that figure from the total since it wasn\u2019t included in previous years\u2019 tallies.)\n\nThe Solar Foundation A map from the report shows where jobs increased and decreased from 2017 to 2018.\n\nThe industry still has far to go to diversify its workforce. Women made up just 26 percent of solar workers, down slightly from a year earlier. Gender nonbinary individuals, counted for the first time this year, were 1.4 percent of solar employees, or 3,427 people. The workforce is over 73 percent white, with Latinos comprising the second-largest group with just shy of 17 percent of the total.\n\nYet the number of veterans in the solar industry \u2015 while slightly lower than a year earlier, falling to 7.8 percent of employees from 8.6 percent \u2015 still outpaced the 6.6 percent of the nation\u2019s overall workforce.\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds of thousands of veterans transitioning every year, and that\u2019s an excellent pipeline for solar,\u201d Gilliland said. \u201cThey have strong work ethics, training, a lot understand safety in electronics, and they have the calling; they want to serve.\u201d\n\nThat could help solve another the problem the industry is facing: fewer qualified workers. Just 21 percent of jobs in solar require a bachelor\u2019s degree. But roughly 60 percent of jobs call for some experience in solar. Twenty-six percent of solar companies last year said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to find qualified candidates to fill open positions, a 44 percent increase from the 18 percent of firms that reported similar troubles in 2017. Installation and project development experience were the biggest demands, with 33 percent of companies reporting it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to find employees, nearly double the number from a year earlier.\n\nThere was a lot of uncertainty about what the tariffs would be. Ed Gilliland, Solar Foundation\n\nSolar jobs paid wages competitive with the median national wage of $18.12 per hour. Non-electrician solar jobs paid on average $18.92 for entry-level workers and $28.11 for mid-level workers. Electrician jobs ranged from $24.32 for entry-level jobs to $32.43 for mid-level gigs.\n\nYet, unlike the much dirtier pipeline and coal-train industries some policymakers hope renewables can supplant, so few solar jobs were unionized that the Solar Industry stopped tracking them a few years ago.\n\n\u201cThe last time we were tracking union labor, it was something like 3 percent of the overall workforce,\u201d Gilliland said. \u201cIt was a small number. We think it\u2019s probably still pretty small.\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution unveiled last Thursday aims to change that. The nonbinding measure, authored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), calls for scaling up solar and wind to generate as close to 100 percent of the nation\u2019s power from renewables over the next decade as possible, and it includes provisions about increasing workers\u2019 right to organize. It also stipulates Green New Deal projects pay union wages.\n\nAt the very least, future legislation based on the ambitious resolution is likely to bolster what\u2019s already expected to be a good year for the solar industry. In 2019, companies expect employment to surge 7 percent to 259,400 jobs.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-trump-green-new-deal_us_5c624d21e4b028d54317509f": "Trump likened the deal \u2014 a sweeping House resolution introduced last week by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen.

He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers \u2014 including his own Secret Service detail \u2014 began their second month without a paycheck.\n\nNow, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nOne former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way he gets it done,\u201d said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump. \u201cAnd screw Puerto Rico,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cPuerto Rico doesn\u2019t have electoral votes last time I checked.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.\n\nWhile Trump has the authority to declare a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill \u2014 a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.\n\nOne of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. \u201cI would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,\u201d he said of the possible emergency declaration. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad law and I think it\u2019s bad strategy for the president.\u201d\n\nKeeping The Public Scared\n\nTrump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an \u201cemergency\u201d that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trump\u2019s own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.\n\nMigrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201cvery bad people.\u201d\n\nWhen the November election passed, so did Trump\u2019s interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up \u201ccaravans\u201d until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.\n\nTrump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last month\u2019s shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native \u2014 also white \u2014 has been charged in those slayings.\n\n\u201cHe continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. That\u2019s his MO. It\u2019s not new,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201cUnfortunately, it works, among some people. But it\u2019s really cynical politics.\u201d\n\nTriggering A National Emergency\n\nCynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.\n\nTrump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2015 one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation\u2019s most dangerous cities,\u201d Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. \u201cNow, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.\u201d\n\nThat brought a rebuke from the city\u2019s mayor the next day. \u201cWe are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,\u201d Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC. \u201cI talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But we\u2019ve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation.\u201d\n\nPrimarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.\n\nWhile Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nDoing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a \u201cjoint resolution\u201d of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans \u2014 and could possibly lose a good deal more.\n\nSome Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m urging the president to tread carefully,\u201d said Texas Republican John Cornyn.\n\nSusan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach. \u201cI think I\u2019ve expressed serious concern about going down that path but let\u2019s wait and see what the president does before we decide,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d he told reporters late last week. \u201cWe will be looking at a national emergency, because I don\u2019t think anything is going to happen.

Construction of the border barrier wasn\u2019t begun until 2008. Snopes reports that in the 30 years ending in 2015, El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate consistently fell \u201cwell below\u201d rates in similar-sized cities, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniformed Crime Reporting data.\n\nThe violent crime rate in El Paso peaked in 1993 (similar to many other U.S. cities), according to local and federal statistics analyzed by the El Paso Times. It fell by 34 percent from then to 2006. From two years before the wall was built to two years after, violent crime actually rose 17 percent, before returning to a downward trend.\n\nTrump has been repeating the false claim since GOP Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton reportedly made a similar false statement to the president last month. Paxton has not produced data to support the comment.\n\nFormer Democratic Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose hometown is El Paso, complained to The Washington Post that Trump is \u201cjust full on, in the most racist terms, completely divorced from ... reality\u201d concerning El Paso crime, and \u201cuses this to incite fear and paranoia.\u201d\n\nRepublican Jon Barela, chief executive of the Borderplex Alliance \u2014 a nonprofit economic development organization in the region \u2014 lashed Trump\u2019s \u201cdamaging comments\u201d that perpetuate the \u201cmyth that we are a dangerous and lawless frontier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that El Paso and most of the cities on the U.S.-Mexico border boast among the safest crime statistics in the entire country,\u201d Barela told the Post.\n\nTrump plans to travel to El Paso Monday for a rally, where he\u2019ll likely repeat the crime lie in a bid to whip up support for his promised border wall.

About 2,300 active-duty troops have also been deployed there.\n\nTrump said during his Tuesday State of the Union address that he\u2019s ordered the deployment of an additional 3,750 active-duty troops to the border to prepare for a \u201ctremendous onslaught\u201d of undocumented immigrants.\n\nTrump\u2019s deployment of military forces to the border could cost taxpayers an estimated $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\n\nAs Lujan Grisham\u2019s decision to withdraw National Guard troops made headlines, the governor shared a campaign video showing her literally careening through walls and criticizing Trump\u2019s promise to build a massive wall at the border.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matthew-whitaker-sheldon-adelson-trump_us_5c5df29ce4b0910c63f05e50": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Friday that nothing \u201ccorrupt\u201d occurred when the Department of Justice suddenly changed an eight-year-old legal interpretation in a way that clearly benefited President Donald Trump\u2019s biggest political donor, casino oligarch Sheldon Adelson.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) asked Whitaker whether he was involved in the January decision of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to alter an established legal interpretation of the Federal Wire Act in order to further limit online gambling and whether he had any communications with Adelson or any of the billionaire\u2019s lobbyists. The new opinion reversed a 2011 OLC interpretation of the act that had applied a prohibition on online gambling strictly to online betting on sports. State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.\n\nWhitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson.\n\n\u201cYour inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,\u201d the acting attorney general said.\n\nRaskin was not satisfied with Whitaker\u2019s answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThis definitely bears further investigation,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWhen and where and by whom remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Jamie Raskin questions acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker at a congressional hearing on Feb. 8, 2019.\n\nThe investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLC\u2019s sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.\n\nSheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.\n\nMore recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.\n\nThe revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNow some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should \u201cwithdraw its opinion\u201d because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.\n\nBesides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senate\u2019s confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trump\u2019s choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sheldon Adelson attends a White House ceremony to see his wife, Miriam, receive the Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in November 2018.\n\nSince 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation \u2015 which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore \u2015 has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.\n\nSo Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesn\u2019t campaign on the grounds that Adelson\u2019s hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.\n\nThe Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal. But bills introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) floundered in Congress amid opposition from both parties and lobbying from those casino companies that had invested in online gaming. Adelson\u2019s lobbying group then focused on convincing the Justice Department to simply issue a new legal opinion overturning the old one.\n\nCharles Cooper, a Washington lawyer working for Adelson, lobbied the Justice Department, sending a memo in 2017 that made the legal argument for upending the 2011 opinion, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nJanuary\u2019s reversal wasn\u2019t the first big victory for Adelson under the Trump administration. Adelson is a longtime supporter of right-wing political parties in Israel and the idea of locating the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. In May 2018, he was a guest of honor at the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump decided to move it from Tel Aviv.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-baby-blimp-el-paso-protest_us_5c5e120fe4b0eec79b23685e": "In less than a day, activists from El Paso raised enough money to transport the mocking Donald Trump baby blimp to the Texas city in time for the president\u2019s first campaign rally of the year on Monday, which is expected to center on his demand for border wall funding.\n\nThe \u201cBaby Trump Does El Paso\u201d GoFundMe page had $4,086 as of Friday, easily meeting a $3,500 goal.

But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media.\n\nOne reason those cases don\u2019t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there\u2019s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they\u2019re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments \u2014 one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 \u2014 are essential parts of the Mueller probe.\n\nThe first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system\u201d and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals \u2015 most of them military intelligence officers \u2015 \u201cconducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public.\n\nOK, other than all those Russians, who in Trump\u2019s circle has Mueller indicted?\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone.\n\nThere were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don\u2019t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn\u2019t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon.\n\nWho has the Mueller investigation found committed crimes?\n\nThe special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates.\n\nManafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial.\n\nIs anyone going to prison?\n\nPapadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat about Paul Manafort?\n\nManafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time.\n\nAfter he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller\u2019s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews \u2015 committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI.\n\nHow long has this Mueller probe been going on?\n\nMueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them \u2015 named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhen is the Mueller report coming out?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it\u2019s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It\u2019s unclear what form that would take.\n\nWhat kind of operation is Mueller running?\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty tight ship. There haven\u2019t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves).\n\nHow has Trump\u2019s legal team responded?\n\nBy getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI \u2015 generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization \u2015 was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau\u2019s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton\u2019s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election.\n\nAfter the Mueller probe wraps up, is that it?\n\nNo. There have been some clear signs that Mueller\u2019s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren\u2019t on Mueller\u2019s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it\u2019s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney\u2019s office without setting off a bunch of alarms.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump\u2019s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August.\n\nSo that\u2019s how Jeff Bezos\u2019 dick pics fit into all this?\n\nRight. The Enquirer published Bezos\u2019 intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos \u2014 the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn\u2019t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There\u2019s a question whether what he calls \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d violates AMI\u2019s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let\u2019s say, a complexifier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in everything?\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2015 based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public.\n\nRosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He\u2019s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed.\n\nWho is Matt Whitaker, and how the heck did he become Rosenstein\u2019s boss?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn\u2019t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush\u2019s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe.\n\nWhere does WikiLeaks fit in?\n\nA key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails\u2019 release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election.\n\nSome of the special counsel\u2019s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone.\n\nSo what is Roger Stone charged with, exactly?\n\nMueller\u2019s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel\u2019s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering.\n\nThe indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury \u2014 referring to a scene in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to \u2014 and threatened Credico\u2019s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIs there anyone else implicated in the Roger Stone indictment?\n\nThere\u2019s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted.\n\nDraft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year.\n\n\n\nGuess we should talk more about Michael Cohen\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress.\n\nHis indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization\u2019s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted.\n\nCohen told investigators that at Trump\u2019s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nWhat ended up happening with the Moscow Trump Tower?\n\nIt never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen\u2019s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with that secret Supreme Court battle?\n\nThis one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business \u2015 called \u201cCorporation\u201d from \u201cCountry A\u201d in court filings \u2015 trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the \u201cCorporation\u201d has to comply with the subpoena, but didn\u2019t explain its decision.\n\nAll this mystery could amount to nothing \u2015 it\u2019s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation.\n\nDoes it matter that the Democrats now control the House?\n\nIt does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe. This would also potentially help bring the Mueller investigation findings into the public eye if the White House or new attorney general attempts to suppress the report.\n\nIs Don Jr. going to prison?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. isn\u2019t currently facing any charges, so at least in the short term, the answer is no. But ever since the special counsel indicted Cohen for lying to Congress, there has been an increased focus on whether Trump Jr. could face similar charges.\n\nTrump Jr. told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that he never directly or indirectly sought foreign assistance for his dad\u2019s campaign. However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion. He held a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin. Days before the meeting, an intermediary emailed Trump Jr. to let him know that a senior Russian government official was offering to provide damaging information on Clinton.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heather-nauert-un-ambassador-nanny_n_5c68ba10e4b05c889d1fe334": "Former Fox News host and State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew Saturday from consideration as UN ambassador in the wake of information that she had employed an immigrant nanny who wasn\u2019t legally allowed to work in the U.S., sources told Bloomberg.\n\nNauert\u2019s statement on her decision concerning the UN post made no mention of the nanny issue. She reportedly employed the nanny at some period in the past. But such a situation would have been particularly troublesome for President Donald Trump after he just declared a national emergency over immigration across the southern border on Friday.\n\nThe nanny news would have emerged after the disturbing firings last month of a dozen undocumented immigrants who had worked for years at the Trump National Golf Club in New York\u2019s Westchester County.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to President Trump and Secretary [Mike] Pompeo for the trust they placed in me for considering me for the position of US Ambassador to the United Nation,\u201d Nauert said in a statement Saturday issued by the State Department. \u201cHowever, the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: Heather Nauert Withdraws Name from consideration to be US Ambassador to UN.

Measles is usually treatable but can pose a serious risk to children younger than 5 years old.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2013, 28 percent of children younger than 5 years old who contracted the disease had to be hospitalized, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In rare cases, measles can lead to permanent brain damage, deafness and death for some children.\n\nThe recent spread of measles in Washington and New York is directly connected to anti-vaccination communities. The outbreaks originated with unvaccinated people traveling to countries such as Israel and Ukraine, where measles outbreaks are occurring, and returning to the U.S. infected. The disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly through pockets of unvaccinated people.\n\nThe number of people choosing not to vaccinate themselves or their children has grown in recent years, largely because of the spread of misinformation about vaccines. Many anti-vaxxers worry such injections pose health risks. But the measles vaccine has been proved exceedingly safe and effective. Receiving two doses of the vaccine as young children is 97 percent effective.\n\nWith the number of anti-vaxxers growing, 2018 saw the most imported measles cases since the virus was thought eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the CDC. As of Feb. 13, there have been at least 73 confirmed cases of measles in the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn since October and 54 confirmed cases in Washington state since January.\n\nDarla Shine correctly noted on Twitter that media outlets were reporting on her anti-vaccination tweets because her husband works for the president, though she didn\u2019t seem to recognize the dangers of spreading misinformation about medical treatments using such a platform.\n\nNeither the Shines nor the White House responded to multiple requests for comment.\n\nTrump appointed Bill Shine to head the White House\u2019s communications in June 2018. Previously, he was a co-president of Fox News until he was forced out in May 2017 over his handling of sexual harassment and misconduct scandals at the network.\n\nDarla Shine previously came under fire for numerous tweets mocking black people.

The government acknowledged that it separated more than 2,700 families under its zero-tolerance policy, and a new report found that thousands more may have been torn apart.\n\nThe claims, which lawyers filed with the government on Monday, detail the painful experiences of people who said their children were pried from their arms by mocking immigration officers \u2015 including one who told a group of women \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d after saying their children would be taken away, according to one claimant \u2015 and given no information about when or whether they would see their kids again.\n\nThe claims also describe the trauma that continues to haunt these families. For example, as a result of the family separations, a 7-year-old girl can no longer sleep without being in her mother\u2019s arms, and a 7-year-old boy refuses to attend school for fear of being separated from his mother once more.\n\n\u201cThese children and their parents have experienced horrific, life-altering trauma that was intentionally inflicted on them by our government,\u201d Stanton Jones, a partner at Arnold & Porter who is representing some of the families, said in a statement. \u201cNo amount of money can undo the damage inflicted by our government on these children and their mothers, but the government must be held accountable for the impact of its policies.\u201d\n\nDania said that on June 6, a day after she crossed the U.S.-Mexico border with her son, immigration officials took him away without her consent while she was being interviewed by a Customs and Border Protection officer. When she asked where her son had been taken, an immigration officer \u201cresponded that the children would be sent away to war,\u201d her claim says.\n\nFor the next week, while she was detained in the U.S., Dania had no idea where her son was. She said she cried constantly, couldn\u2019t eat or sleep and developed intense headaches.\n\n\u201cIt was like they were killing me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the worst pain I\u2019ve felt in my life.\u201d\n\nOn June 15, Dania said, she was deported to Guatemala, despite having told an immigration officer that she feared for her life back home. She worried that she would never see her child again.\n\nWhen her son, now 18, called her at the end of June, she said, she was overjoyed, but after hanging up, she became worried again, since she had no idea if they would be reunited.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to him,\u201d Dania said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if he was going to be sent back to my country or given up for adoption or sent to war.\u201d\n\nDuring the thick of Trump\u2019s zero-tolerance policy, child psychologists warned that the trauma of family separation could have lasting effects on children, impeding brain development and resulting in physical illnesses such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\nLeticia, who said she was separated from her 5-year-old daughter for four months, said her daughter continues to feel the effects of the trauma.\n\n\u201cMy daughter is not the same,\u201d Leticia said in a statement put out by her lawyers. \u201cTo this day, if she drops something at home, she cries and begs me not to get mad at her or hit her. It breaks my heart to think of what she endured and how it has changed my beautiful, happy baby girl.\u201d\n\nIn September, Dania was finally reunited with her son in Guatemala. According to her claim, she said they both suffer from depression as a result of the separation and are struggling to return to a normal life.", "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-el-chapo-border-wall_us_5c63eb3be4b03de942973c9c": "Sen.
